460c0201 [tongue_click] Earlier this week Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger told reporters at a breakfast meeting that the B\. one\'s problems weren\'t serious 
460c0202 There are also problems with the new planes he said 
460c0203 The B\. one however is a very good bomber 
460c0204 With more than three hundred and eighty five billion dollars of reported stock *assets* the investment advisers control a sizable chunk of pension assets and private portfolios 
460c0205 Investment *advisers* tend to be small private partnerships whose owners manage the portfolios [misc_noise] 
460c0206 They are often known for a maverick investment strategies and high fees 
460c0207 Buying corporate zeros for an I\. R\. A\. neutralizes their most obvious disadvantage the tax treatment 
460c0208 With rare exceptions such bonds trigger personal income tax each year on the theoretical accumulation or accretion of interest 
460c0209 That means investors pay tax on money they haven\'t yet received 
460c020a If the bonds are bought for an I\. R\. A\. however no tax is due until the money is withdrawn 
460c020b After much conflict Secretary of State Cyrus Vance struck a deal in nineteen seventy seven 
460c020c Each embassy complex had to be occupied simultaneously 
460c020d Construction of the Soviet Union\'s Washington Embassy was completed in nineteen seventy nine before work on the U\. S\.\'s new Moscow Embassy had even started 
460c020e The Soviets then pushed to occupy their new site but the U\. S\. resisted until its own buildings were ready 
460c020f As the U\. S\. buildings were completed in Moscow the Soviets were allowed to move into some of their new facilities on Mount Alto 
460c020g Only the main ambassadorial building at each site are vacant 
460c020h Mr\. Begel said Pullman will finance the purchase through its existing credit lines 
460c020i Also Pullman has about forty five million dollars in cash he said 
460c020j Pullman earned sixteen \.POINT two million dollars <in> on *revenue* of five hundred thirty four million dollars for the year ended September thirtieth nineteen eighty six 
460c020k The recapitalization was proposed to thwart a takeover effort by British Printing and Communication Corporation 
460c020l The Oxford England publishing and printing concern controlled by Robert Maxwell filed suit in federal court in New York this week to block the recapitalization 
460c020m A court victory would pave the way for Mr\. Maxwell to make a new offer for Harcourt 
460c020n [tongue_click] Captain overhearing the radio discussion about runway oh five I understood nothing 
460c020o And what runway 
460c020p What are you talking about 
460c020q [tongue_click] Still securities and banking *regulators* worry whether they are acting fast enough to safeguard against growing risks in the world\'s financial markets 
460c020r [tongue_click] Many agree there is little time to waste in the scramble to create better international regulation 
460c020s As Mr\. Feldstein says You can\'t just look at the building and say it hasn\'t fallen down yet so we should be safe 
460c020t Then Secretary Haig took his plan to the White House 
460c020u [tongue_click] He insisted that the State Department must control the policy and even asked the president to order the Defense Department to supply personnel to help plan details 
460c020v The idea was rejected 
460c020w Not long ago Tenneco was considered an unlikely *restructuring* candidate 
460c020x Its heavy debts and depressed energy and farm equipment businesses made it appear immune to raiders 
460c020y But the company\'s improving business prospects and asset values have changed that 
460c020z [tongue_click] A South Korean airliner vanished somewhere near Burma and apparently crashed into the sea or thick jungle officials in Seoul said 
460c0210 The Korean Air jet with a hundred fifty people abroad was en route to Seoul from Baghdad when aviation officials lost contact with the plane 
460c0211 K\. A\. L\. officials wouldn\'t rule out the possibility of hijacking or sabotage 
460c0212 But others notably Wells Fargo Investment Advisers pressed on 
460c0213 We felt that the futures market reflected actual trading levels at the time says Fred Grauer the head of Wells Fargo and Company subsidiary 
460c0214 Many stock prices hadn\'t been updated in several minutes he explains and it was likely that subsequent stock trades would be at even lower levels 
460c0215 By day\'s end Wells sold fourteen thousand futures contracts amounting to nearly two billion dollars 
460c0216 Eventually the flight landed at a nearby airport 
460c0217 But the terminal facilities were closed so Mr\. Barrett and five other passengers had to scale a wire fence to get out 
460c0218 A nearby hotel picked them up and charged them eighteen dollars and seventy five cents each for the van ride 
460c0219 Nacco management believes that a fragmented portable appliance industry is undergoing a consolidation and Nacco wants to be a player in that process Mr\. Smith said 
460c021a We wouldn\'t have acquired WearEver ProctorSilex if there weren\'t an opportunity to add to it he said 
460c021b Electric appliances are the largest part of that business he said 
460c021c [tongue_click] Today the mutual fund industry is on the ropes with sales plummeting ninety seven \%PERCENT in a single year 
460c021d This illustrates the sad truth that things can change overnight in the stock market 
460c021e Like say the night of October eighteenth nineteen eighty seven 
460c0301 Last year sponsors of a strong acid rain bill claimed to have a tentative one vote majority on the committee in favor of their bill 
460c0302 The measure was co sponsored by one third of the House and support appeared to be growing 
460c0303 Representative Dingell whose district\'s steel and auto industries opposed the bill bottled it up in the committee 
460c0304 [tongue_click] Gorbachev discussed arms control issues with other Warsaw Pact leaders in East Berlin 
460c0305 While details weren\'t disclosed Soviet officials indicated that there would be no unilateral withdrawal of Soviet troops from Eastern Europe 
460c0306 Spokesmen said there would be no report on the conference before its conclusion scheduled for today 
460c0307 The sale also provides the federal government with cash as it tries to narrow the budget deficit 
460c0308 After subtracting underwriters\' fees of about seventy million dollars the government\'s net proceeds from the offering are one \.POINT five eight billion dollars 
460c0309 In addition the government has already been paid three hundred million dollars from Conrail\'s cash reserves under provisions of the public offering 
460c030a But the incident wasn\'t reported 
460c030b As Mr\. McGowan remembers it the United captain who normally files such reports simply said Let\'s forget about it 
460c030c It\'s not worth the trouble 
460c030d Mr\. Kaplan joined *Macmillan* in nineteen sixty when a company he co founded The Free Press was sold to the publisher 
460c030e He became president of Macmillan Publishing in nineteen sixty five and was named managing director of the company\'s British subsidiary in nineteen seventy four 
460c030f He reassumed the post of president in nineteen seventy seven and was appointed chairman in nineteen eighty 
460c030g [tongue_click] Securities analysts however remain concerned about basic loan demand 
460c030h Brent Erensel of Dean Witter Reynolds Incorporated noted Lending volume generally isn\'t robust 
460c030i Margins are down because of the new tax law and the suspension of interest payments in Brazil 
460c030j On the other hand he *said* loan portfolio quality is improving and banks are getting a better grip on controlling expenses 
460c030k Mr\. Lay said the losses occured in late September and early this month a time particular volatility in oil markets 
460c030l There were two senior people colluding and keeping a separate set of books apart from the official books for a few weeks Mr\. Lay said 
460c030m Their guesses were wrong on both sides of the market 
460c030n Mr\. Kitajima gets excited 
460c030o He predicts a big gain in the index maybe a thousand points 
460c030p It\'s just a feeling I have he says 
460c030q Worlds of Wonder needs to convince creditors to extend it time through the Christmas season which is by far the biggest sales period for toy companies 
460c030r It\'s in the creditors\' best interest to keep the company going at least for now says Fred Anschel an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Incorporated 
460c030s As of September thirtieth the company\'s inventory was a hundred twenty eight million dollars a spokeswoman said 
460c030t People thought we\'d just sit back and just enjoy the holidays said Edward P\. Nicoski market strategist at Piper Jaffray and Hopwood Incorporated Minneapolis 
460c030u [tongue_click] But we\'re seeing some strong buying here 
460c030v We\'re seeing a whole bunch of stocks breaking out of their trading ranges

460c030x Outdoor organ music blares Lawrence Welk tunes one day as two boys skate alone on the ice with hockey sticks 
460c030y It looks nice doesn\'t it a Shearson official bitterly remarks 
460c030z Underneath the skating rink is a gymnasium Shearson is trying to sell 
460c0310 Mr\. Lichten didn\'t return phone calls seeking comment 
460c0311 However bank executives speculate that his departure was linked to Chase\'s merger last December of its investment banking and commercial banking functions 
460c0312 Following the reorganization Mr\. Lichten became executive vice president for tax related financings and foreign corporate clients 
460c0313 The Fed\'s posture through all of this is remarkably similar to that of the William McChesney Martin Fed of the mid nineteen fifties 
460c0314 [tongue_click] There was never any question about Mr\. Martin\'s priorities he was first of all an inflation fighter and that was certainly to the good 
460c0315 But no one was ever sure just how the Fed would wage its inflation battles 
460c0316 Mr\. Martin indicated he would lean against the wind when he sensed inflation coming and it did 
460c0317 He got rid of the inflation surge that began in nineteen fifty six but it took the deep nineteen fifty seven fifty eight recession to do so 
460c0318 [tongue_click] This is the poorest land in the West beset by corruption illiteracy disease and a history of governments that seemingly have made those conditions policy goals 
460c0319 [tongue_click] Haiti\'s problems and peculiarities now seem to b- so towering that the latest political twists probably won\'t mean much 
460c031a Western notions of progress and development fade in the smoke of a voodoo priest\'s flaming magic stones 
460c031b Schering Plough said Grupo Ache has an option to buy the rest 
460c031c The Brazilian operations based in Rio de Janeiro include a pharmaceutical manufacturing plant and offices that employ about nine hundred people 
460c031d Schering Plough said Grupo Ache would install its own management 
460c031e [tongue_click] The Brazilian facility had nineteen eighty eight sales of seventy million dollars 
460c0401 Citicorp attributed the dissolution of the project which focused on oil and *petrochemicals* to the sharp decline of oil prices in the past year 
460c0402 A Citicorp spokesman said curtailments in trading operations at major oil companies and the drop of the dollar volume of oil trading hurt the demand for the service 
460c0403 Gemco had hoped eventually to expand the business to include other commodities but those plans have been dropped 
460c0404 Under the plan existing holders who owned three \.POINT three million common shares will own about ninety \%PERCENT of the common in the reorganized company 
460c0405 The plan calls for Mr\. Williams to receive a bonus of a hundred thousand shares and options to buy another three hundred thousand shares over a four year period 
460c0406 Some shares will be reserved for other Salant officers and employees 
460c0407 If all options were exercised Mr\. Williams would hold nine \.POINT four two \%PERCENT interest in the company 
460c0408 They are firmly based on three principles 
460c0409 [tongue_click] The first is that trust and freedom should take precedence over regulation and *bureaucratic* control 
460c040a If people at every level of society are deprived of the authority co- commensurate with their duties they quickly lose their motivation and their sense of responsibility 
460c040b To change such thinking Ford has recently begun circulating new salary guidelines 
460c040c We won\'t even look at the staff in considering salaries says Mr\. Hausman 
460c040d The auto maker has also done away with cost of living and general salary increases in favor of merit raises to promote productivity 
460c040e Fujitsu Limited\'s three hundred million dollars of five year Eurobonds with the same basic terms closed at ninety eight to ninety nine 
460c040f The Japanese electronics concern is affected by the U\. S\.\'s newly imposed duties on certain products according to an official at Nikko Securities Company which led the issue 
460c040g But it isn\'t clear how large the impact will be 
460c040h A Conrail engineer was indicted on charges of manslaughter in connection with the January fourth collision of three locomotives with an Amtrak passenger train in Maryland 
460c040i Sixteen people were killed and about a hundred and seventy five injured in the crash 
460c040j A grand jury found that the engineer had operated the locomotives in a grossly neg- negligent manner 
460c040k [tongue_click] Polaroid still must refine these technologies before they can be used in major consumer systems 
460c040l Initial high priced commercial systems using the technologies must be available by nineteen ninety but consumer systems will take longer 
460c040m Moreover any new system that Polaroid brings to market isn\'t guaranteed success because other camera companies are working on electronic imaging systems as well 
460c040n Israel\'s Shamir hopes to avoid looking like the spoiler of peace prospects by floating a regional peace conference plan involving only Israel and Arab states 
460c040o He bills it as an alternative to rival Peres\'s plans for an international meeting leading to Israel Jordan talks 
460c040p But Jordan and the Palestinians both find Shamir\'s plan unacceptable 
460c040q Second there was Mr\. Kinnock himself 
460c040r [tongue_click] His strategies and poll takers have long known that most British voters only have a fuzzy idea of what kind of man he is 
460c040s Part of his problem was Mrs\. Thatcher whose powerful personality has dominated the stage for almost a decade 
460c040t People generally respect Mrs\. Thatcher but not many really like her 
460c040u The company attributed the earnings increase to growing popularity of its three plus network operating system which is used with International Business Machine Corp\.\'s personal computers and compatible models 
460c040v The company also said initial orders for its three plus network operating system for Apple Computer Incorporated Macintosh have been extremely encouraging 
460c040w The system for the Macintosh was introduced in August 
460c040x The promotions will continue to increase in nineteen eighty eight Mr\. Rice predicts 
460c040y The discounting is likely to be particularly sharp this month and next a period dubbed Death Valley Days in the business because sales are usually so slow 
460c040z Domino\'s this month began its first national ad campaign for a two for one offer 
460c0410 Many people may have been highly surprised by Mr\. Jackson\'s historic victories on Super Tuesday 
460c0411 Though many polls accurately recorded his growing strength the news stories accompanying these polls had the usual immense difficulty in mentioning the difficult name of Jackson 
460c0412 This was true in the case of the New York Times and the Washington Post 
460c0413 Small business owners especially those with older or larger businesses think George Bush\'s policy would be the most favorable for small business 
460c0414 But the vice president hardly won a ringing endorsement he rated only five \.POINT eight on a scale of ten 
460c0415 And among women business owners Mr\. Bush had only a four \.POINT eight rating 
460c0416 Kodak makes a billion pounds annually mostly for itself 
460c0417 It sells about two million pounds to six U\. S\. distributors who resell to others 
460c0418 Kodak knows the identity of the end users of one million pounds but can\'t account for the rest 
460c0419 Hoechst Celanese sells acetic anhydride to dozens of distributors a spokesman says 
460c041a In some instances we know who the distributor sells to the spokesman says 
460c041b In some cases we don\'t 
460c041c As Britain\'s flag carrier the airline inherited a vast route network 
460c041d British Caledonian brought routes to the southern U\. S\. the Middle East and Africa as well as lucrative flights to East Asia 
460c041e British Airways gave up only a few routes from Gatwick to European cities which in most cases is already served from Heathrow 
460c041f Traders said investors apparently were skittish about buying the Kroger preferred after the company\'s announcements to restructure 
460c041g Traders said the company will now pay its Dutch auction preferred holders eight \.POINT nine one \%PERCENT over the next forty nine days until the next regularly scheduled auction 
460c041h That rate is more than two percentage points over preferred dividends by similar single A\. rated companies 
461c0201 Last week there were reports that after the offering Shearson Lehman had a big unsold chunk of stock 
461c0202 In a narrowly drawn statement vice chairman Herbert Freiman denied Shearson had offered a block to Salomon Brothers which managed the selling brokers\' floor operation 
461c0203 Mr\. Freiman wouldn\'t elaborate 
461c0204 Chicago Magazine has annual revenue of about thirteen million dollars and is operating at about break even Metropolitan Detroit officials said 
461c0205 But they said they expect to trim costs by combining both magazines\' paper and printing expenses 
461c0206 Chicago Magazine still hasn\'t hit its stride said Tom Jones publisher and executive vice president of Metropolitan Detroit 
461c0207 There\'s tremendous room to grow in terms of ad pages 
461c0208 Contra leaders say they look forward to the military challenge 
461c0209 It\'s in our ballpark says Carlos Ulvert the Contra foreign secretary 
461c020a He and other Contras assert that congressional stinginess until this year kept the Contras from picking up steam on the battlefield 
461c020b [lip_smack] Mr\. Ulvert adds If we\'re going to have ten thousand men in Nicaragua better trained and better supplied their military presence is going to be felt 
461c020c That line may be wearing thin with private banks 
461c020d They would like to see more evidence of sound policy moves 
461c020e Otherwise why keep pouring good money after bad 
461c020f At W\. F\. I\. A\. running the formula last January thirtieth meant buying more than two hundred thousand shares of Reebok quickly 
461c020g That\'s because W\. F\. I\. A\. likes to own all the stocks in the S\. and P\. five hundred index in amounts scaled to their market weight 
461c020h Those holdings range from more than one \.POINT four billion dollars of I\. B\. M\. to just six hundred and seventy three thousand dollars of Allis Chalmers Corporation 
461c020i His first test on that issue will be whether he can persuade the opposition to field a candidate against him 
461c020j The chief opposition party the Reunification and Democracy Party led by Kim Young Sam has vowed it won\'t participate in any election under the current constitution 
461c020k It and the National Coalition for a Democratic Constitution a newly formed alliance of religious and dissident groups are organizing tomorrow\'s opposition rallies 
461c020l Sounds good but what\'s the catch 
461c020m Mr\. Leming a chemicals analyst issued his report June twenty second with Seagram trading at seventy seven 
461c020n It closed yesterday at seventy six and three eighths up one and seven eighths 
461c020o This reasoning has clearly failed to galvanize the market 
461c020p Mr\. Leming didn\'t return calls seeking comment yesterday 
461c020q Gemfibrozil has long been known to increase H\. D\. L\. but until this report its effect on heart disease was unclear 
461c020r Available in the U\. S\. since nineteen eighty two gemfibrozil gained only limited use 
461c020s That is because gemfibrozil only moderately reduces L\. D\. L\. compared with other drugs 
461c020t The rollbacks could be unexpectedly painful for some hourly workers 
461c020u Chrysler\'s unemployment fund has been drained to the point that benefits are already being reduced a U\. A\. W\. spokesman said 
461c020v The fund has at least in part been drained by workers temporarily laid off when plants were closed down for retooling 
461c020w The winner in the general election used some creative methods too 
461c020x Ronald Reagan\'s campaign registered voters for the general election campaign using two million dollars charged to his uncontested renomination 
461c020y The staff of the election commission challenged that and recommended that seven hundred and seventy eight thousand dollars in federal subsidies be repaid to the Treasury 
461c020z But the auditors were overruled by a four to one vote of the commission in which all Republican members sided with the president 
461c0210 As soon as two months from now Argentine courts are due to try the last groups of generals still subject to prosecution for alleged human rights abuses 
461c0211 The proceedings are the last chance to bring military men to civilian justice 
461c0212 So far in four years of civilian government seven top military officials have been convicted 
461c0213 Charges were brought against hundreds of others but prosecutions were halted last year in the face of army restiveness 
461c0214 The argument was that the accused officers had only been acting under orders 
461c0215 Kaiser\'s present value is equally uncertain the company estimates that its net worth is at least a negative five hundred million dollars 
461c0216 In its lawsuits against former management the company is seeking damages of more than three hundred million dollars for alleged self dealing and mismanagement 
461c0217 [lip_smack] In the process the suits allege assets were overstated and liabilities understated 
461c0218 Remember the one about the investment banker 
461c0219 It was widely told circa October nineteenth nineteen eighty seven and went like this What do you call an investment banker 
461c021a Hey waiter 
461c021b Now stung by the recent debt laden takeovers some fund managers are planning to dump industrial bonds 
461c021c Others will reduce their exposure to them 
461c021d What men are buying instead bonds issued by utilities banks and foreign companies those with the least chance of being bought out 
461c021e Others are buying safer Treasury bonds whose yields are a percentage or less below top grade industrial debt 
461c0301 Along with that surge has come an explosion of another sort 
461c0302 The number of complaints and inquiries we\'re getting is enormous says Cecelia Charles acting director of consumer affairs for the Securities and Exchange Commission 
461c0303 They\'re increasing between five \%PERCENT and ten \%PERCENT a year 
461c0304 There will be about thirty six thousand of them this year 
461c0305 Delta is expected to announce that it will become the new official carrier for Walt Disney World in Orlando Florida 
461c0306 The airline is calling today\'s announcement the most important marketing endeavor in Delta\'s recent history 
461c0307 For rival Eastern Airlines a unit of Texas Air Corporation it may be yet another loss of prestige 
461c0308 Under the plan existing holders who owned three \.POINT three million common shares will own about ninety \%PERCENT of the common in the reorganized company 
461c0309 The plan calls for Mr\. Williams to receive a bonus one hundred thousand shares and options to buy another three hundred thousand shares over a four year period 
461c030a Some shares will be reserved for other Salant officers and employees 
461c030b If all options were exercised Mr\. Williams would hold a nine \.POINT four two \%PERCENT interest in the company 
461c030c I thought for a moment 
461c030d Have you given any serious thought to diversifying 
461c030e Maybe you should have a variety of holdings in your portfolio 
461c030f Or perhaps you should limit your exposure by hedging 
461c030g You could make a play on both sides of this deal I suggested earnestly 
461c030h Also providing some solace for municipal bond professionals is the fact that commercial banks are becoming more active as underwriters rather than as investors 
461c030i This means they will need to hire more investment bankers 
461c030j The banks\' move is part of their effort to test and expand the limits of securities and banking laws 
461c030k I\. R\. E\. has downsized its real estate syndication business and is primarily a savings and loan holding company Mr\. Levan said 
461c030l Earnings in the past were somewhat erratic quarter to quarter because the major business was real estate syndication 
461c030m Now the S\. and L\. holding company is the main business with down sized real estate syndication 
461c030n Core earnings are very consistent 
461c030o We need a new national policy on the role telecommunications should play in our society 
461c030p Our current policy is still based on the Communications Act of nineteen thirty four framed when the electronic computer was still a dream 
461c030q The act provided the impetus for achieving the overriding telecommunications objective of that time universal service 
461c030r But this objective has for all practical purposes been fulfilled 
461c030s With no new objective to focus on policy has drifted with each regulatory body defending the interests of its own constituency 
461c030t Mr\. Li\'s caution may be particularly appropriate for China at present diplomats in Beijing said 
461c030u After several years of spectacular growth China\'s economy is struggling 
461c030v Prices are skyrocketing corruption is rampant and grain production is stagnant 
461c030w Even the most liberal reformers believe China\'s economic planners should move in the coming year to solve such problems before further reforms can be introduced 
461c030x For over half a century federal policy has sapped the productivity of the world\'s strongest agricultural industry 
461c030y The real issue is not the dollar amount of U\. S\. food exports but whether those exports are sold at a profit or a loss 
461c030z The sooner politicians stop trying to help farmers the better off the most efficient productive farmers will be 
461c0310 The winner will be thrown immediately into his role as Comex ambassador 
461c0311 The day after the election he will be flown to Boca Raton Florida for the futures industry\'s annual convention 
461c0312 Both men have reservations 
461c0313 He said actions he took eliminated one management layer and will cause more executives to report directly to him 
461c0314 In the past the company has been criticized for being too bureaucratic and slow moving 
461c0315 The new management structure will shorten the approval cycle and communication cycle with the company Mr\. McDonnell said 
461c0316 Nor is the number seventeen a magic number stressed Doctor Shaw 
461c0317 If we had two hundred and fifty copies we might have found one hundred different viruses he said 
461c0318 He termed the speed of mutation extraordinary and compared the AIDS virus with other swiftly changing viruses such as influenza 
461c0319 As Britain\'s flag carrier the airline inherited a vast route network 
461c031a British Caledonian brought routes to the southern U\. S\. the Middle East and Africa as well as lucrative flights to East Asia 
461c031b British Airways gave up only a few routes from Gatwick to European cities which in most cases it already served from Heathrow 
461c031c W\. J\. Sanders the third Advanced Micro\'s chairman and chief executive officer blamed an industry wide sea change for the company\'s problems 
461c031d Customers especially desktop computer makers are buying fewer chips because they have large inventories of unused parts for the problems 
461c031e But other market specialists said Advanced Micro\'s problems are unique amid a semiconductor industry that remains generally robust 
461c031f She said the company expects the new model to expand the market rather than cannibalize sales of conventional methods 
461c031g The South San Francisco California company declined to project sales for the new model 
461c031h In American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday Diasonics shares closed unchanged at two \.POINT eight seven five dollars 
461c0401 The Federal Reserve Board in Washington has lost track of one hundred and thirty five \.POINT nine billion dollars 
461c0402 Its trackers figure that American adults have eighteen billion dollars in their pockets and around the house 
461c0403 But that is only about twelve \.PERCENT of the bills and loose change they can\'t directly account for 
461c0404 Here are price trends on the world\'s major stock markets as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective Geneva 
461c0405 To make them c- directly comparable each index is based on the close of nineteen sixty nine equaling one hundred 
461c0406 The percentage change is since year end

463c030o Nine of the ten deaths in the past three years occurred when children were strangled by strings used to tie the pacifiers around their necks 
463c030p *Commission* regulations prohibit the sale of pacifiers with strings and require a label warning against this practice 
463c030q Any further effort to reduce the hazards associated with pacifiers would divert attention and resources from greater dangers and the warnings probably would cause needless worry 
463c030r Judge Bork\'s likely defeat is a turning point in our constitutional history precisely because it is not a turning point 
463c030s Never before has a Supreme Court nominee been defeated because of his general approach to the Constitution

463c0311 Meanwhile Audi set up a bonus plan to encourage dealership salespeople to sell Audi eighty and ninety cars newer models that carry far less generous incentives 
463c0312 Under the bonus plan Audi promised to give sales people two hundred fifty dollars every time they sold an eighty or ninety model

463c0314 During any repair process blood clots are constantly being formed and dissolved 
463c0315 It is quite possible scientists speculate that during attempts to repair the artery wall the body at some point tries to dissolve a blood clot 
463c0316 But it mistakenly grabs protein A\. instead of plasminogen pulling it with its bag of fat and cholesterol into the artery wall 
463c0317 This thwarts the repair process and begins a vicious cycle drawing more and more cholesterol into the damaged area 
463c0318 And in fact microscopic blood clots and bits of L\. P\. A\. are found in the mishmash of the deposits 
463c0319 Many traders assume the financing will consist of three year notes ten year notes and thirty year bonds 
463c031a But some traders say they aren\'t so sure there will be any thirty year bonds 
463c031b The reason President Reagan hasn\'t yet signed a tax bill with a provision that would increase the goverment\'s long term bond issuance authority 
463c031c The existing benchmark thirty year bonds ended one and three eighths lower or down thirteen dollars and seventy five cents for each one thousand dollar face amount

463c0401 As expected the budget will include a number of proposals that were s- unsuccessful last year including the sale of the Naval Petroleum Reserve and the Bonneville Power Administration 
463c0402 Some administration and congressional aides think Congress will go along with selling the petroleum reserve this year 
463c0403 But resistance to the Bonneville idea was so strong that lawmakers passed a resolution prohibiting the administration from spending any federal money to study it 
463c0404 [tongue_click] Such results are causing some Wall Street professionals to take the January indicator less seriously than they used to 
463c0405 I\'m putting less emphasis on some of these traditional barometers says Eugene Peroni director of technical research for Janney Montgomery Scott Incorporated in Philadelphia 
463c0406 They are not the most scientific things around 
463c0407 Banks and insurance companies are likely to have the highest salary increases this year at about six \%PERCENT Mr\. Peck said 
463c0408 Manufacturing and construction companies will be the lowest at about five \%PERCENT he added 
463c0409 Mr\. Peck said the survey didn\'t cover Wall Street brokerage houses where salaries and bonuses have soared in recent years

463c040w A good place to start is the nineteen eighty eight campaign 
463c040x With Europe having made concessions to the United States Mr\. Baker and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan <would> could come under increasing pressure to help stem the dollar\'s recent fall 
463c040y For weeks the U\. S\. currency has been plummeting

463c0410 Takeover targets turned into a mixed performance 
463c0411 Firestone was up one and a half to sixty three one eighth after it disclosed that it is exploring various options in response to Pirelli Group\'s takeover bid 
463c0412 The options include discussions with Japan\'s Brig- Bridgestone to determine what course Bridgestone might pursue 
463c0413 Firestone said that because of the Pirelli offer it\'s unlikely to complete the proposed sale of seventy five \%PERCENT of its tire making and wholesaling operation to Bridgestone 
463c0414 The whole environment has changed he says 
463c0415 We have a lot more options than we did before

464c020e This gives me the opportunity to do both 
464c020f [lip_smack] L\. T\. V\. has said repeatedly since its filing that it would fight any creditor move to either reorganize the unit separately or force its sale 
464c020g [lip_smack] Creditors on the other hand have discussed the idea almost since the day of L\. T\. V\.\'s filing 
464c020h And the pension agency the banks and the committee representing unsecured creditors have recently been holding serious discussions on the issue 
464c020i A source close to Texaco said that while Texaco is anxious to emerge from Chapter eleven it isn\'t in the company\'s or shareholders\' interest to rush into a settlement 
464c020j [lip_smack] It\'s normal for creditors to want a quick settlement 
464c020k But Texaco\'s shareholders have a big say in this case and they aren\'t pushing for a settlement for settlement\'s sake the source said 
464c020l [lip_smack] Separately Pacific Lighting completed the previously reported sale of its land development subsidiaries to two investment groups for three hundred and twenty five million dollars 
464c020m The sale will result in a fourth quarter gain of about twelve million dollars or twenty cents a share 
464c020n The company earlier had said it expected to post the gain for the third quarter

464c020v [lip_smack] The proceedings are the last chance to bring military men to civilian justice 
464c020w So far in four years of civilian government seven top military officials have been convicted 
464c020x Charges were brought against hundreds of others but prosecutions were halted last year in the face of army restiveness 
464c020y The argument was that the accused officers had only been acting under orders

464c0213 Groff wouldn\'t identify the potential bidders and said no firm offers have been made 
464c0214 The maker of aluminum products said it hired Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc\. to help assess its options and advise it on any bids that might materialize 
464c0215 [lip_smack] The review may result in the sale of the company to another entity Groff said 
464c0216 [lip_smack] As previously reported Warner and Lorimar agreed in May to merge in a stock swap valued at about six hundred and forty million dollars 
464c0217 [lip_smack] Chris Craft Industries Inc\. Warner\'s largest shareholder has filed suit to delay the merger charging that it violates Chris Craft\'s shareholder agreement with Warner

464c0219 In Connecticut\'s Senate race traditional politics is turned upside down 
464c021a It is hardly any wonder that twenty five \%PERCENT of the likely voters in the state are undecided another word for confused 
464c021b Setting the undecided voters aside the contest is close with the latest Hartford Courant \/SLASH Connecticut poll showing the two candidates neck and neck 
464c021c Mr\. Lieberman\'s supporters are sporting buttons that read Dead Heat

464c0304 The mining was a classic example of covert activity advancing national security goals secretly 
464c0305 [lip_smack] The Corinto mining had a sensible U\. S\. security objective curtailing the shipment of Soviet bloc arms to Central America through the communist government of Nicaragua 
464c0306 The existence of the operation leaked out and once exposed details flowed freely from Congress 
464c0307 The activity ended 
464c0308 This example is not unique 
464c0309 Opponents of covert activity have discovered that by leaking covert operations into the news they can create a debilitating aura of suspicion and illegitimacy around foreign policies they dislike 
464c030a [loud_breath] The companies\' sharply improved results provided more evidence of a rebound in both the chip and personal computer industries 
464c030b The results follow a report last week from the Semiconductor Industry Association that the beleaguered chip industry is experiencing an upturn 
464c030c [lip_smack] In March the industry\'s leading indicator reached the highest level since nineteen eighty four 
464c030d [lip_smack] I\. R\. E\. has downsized its real . estate syndication business and is primarily a savings and loan holding company Mr\. Levan said 
464c030e [lip_smack] Earnings in the past were somewhat erratic quarter to quarter because the major business was real estate syndication 
464c030f Now the S\. and L\. holding company is the main business with down sized real estate syndication 
464c030g Core earnings are very consistent 
464c030h Since the presidential and congressional campaigns will dominate national attention next year there will be relatively little focus on state races 
464c030i [tongue_click] Partly to avoid overtly inserting presidential politics into state politics many states have changed the date of their statehouse elections to off years 
464c030j [lip_smack] As a result only twelve of the fifty states few of them large are electing governors next year 
464c030k Lincoln has about two million common shares outstanding 
464c030l Yesterday in composite trading on the American Stock Exchange Lincoln closed at eleven dollars \.POINT one two five a share up twelve \.POINT five cents

464c030n The New York Stock Exchange proposal would place higher controls on the exchange\'s automated order execution computer system called SuperDot which is central to most program trading 
464c030o A second proposal said to be before the board would eliminate all program trading using the SuperDot system 
464c030p [lip_smack] But that proposal is given a smaller chance of passing the board the sources said 
464c030q But Senator David Boren district of Oklahoma the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee was less optimistic 
464c030r This is no way to begin a relationship under a treaty as important as this if these deliberate am:biguities remain he told reporters 
464c030s Senator Cohen also said he is less optimistic that the U\. S\. Soviet differences can be resolved quickly 
464c030t [lip_smack] One of the more direct readings on inflation will come in Friday\'s report on consumer prices which are expected not surprisingly to be higher 
464c030u Analysts expect an increase of about \.POINT four \%PERCENT in the April consumer price index on the heels of a \.POINT five \%PERCENT jump the previous month 
464c030v [lip_smack] The price increases are expected pretty much across the board as commodities and services are rising at about a four \%PERCENT annual rate 
464c030w It has now been eleven nights since the arrest of Francis Seow former solicitor general and law society president in Singapore 
464c030x While Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew\'s government has admitted holding Mr\. Seow it has kept him totally incommunicado

464c0315 Frankfurt share prices closed mostly lower in moderately active trading Friday . as an early rally fizzled amid position squaring before the weekend and uncertainty about the lower dollar 
464c0316 The D\. A\. X\. index dropped five \.POINT four nine to twelve eight nine \.POINT seven two 
464c0317 After opening broadly higher the tide turned at midday when the dollar\'s slide to a three year low began to worry market participants 
464c0318 [lip_smack] That fight while remarkable for its bitterness . typifies the core problem in the nationwide push to contain medical costs Who gets less 
464c0319 Doctors want to maintain their authority and their incomes 
464c031a Hospitals are fighting to hang onto revenue more than a third of which comes from Medicare 
464c031b [tongue_click] And patients don\'t want to see services decrease 
464c031c But the health care system now consumes about one million dollars a minute and all agree it needs taming 
464c031d Then in nineteen eighty four National Union joined the market 
464c031e Its policy for state judges the biggest clients costs eight hundred dollars a year for a one million dollar policy with no deductible

464c0402 Per share earnings for the nineteen eighty seven and nineteen eighty six quarters benefited from thirty seven \.POINT two million dollars of good will amortization in each period 
464c0403 The good will amortization represents the amount above book value that G\. M\. paid for Hughes Aircraft 
464c0404 That accounting adjustment represents a charge against G\. M\.\'s earnings 
464c0405 Before Friday it seemed that only an unexpected break in the Delaware court case could have extracted Henley from the dilemma it now faces 
464c0406 Thus the case was closely watched 
464c0407 But it also raised important issues of corporate law 
464c0408 [lip_smack] The most important of these was a contention that Santa Fe\'s board acted illegally last December when it lowered the threshhold for a shareholder rights plan to twenty \%PERCENT 
464c0409 Previously the rights or poison pill were triggered automatically only if fifty \%PERCENT of the stock were in hostile hands 
464c040a S\. D\. I\. despite what the Defense Luddites say is not an adventure in technology application 
464c040b It is a tool of national policy and as with any tool it is supposed to be used with a specific objective in mind 
464c040c The objective lest we forget it is to prevent a global nuclear war 
464c040d [lip_smack] His inability to recover from October\'s market plunge was traced to a hostile bid from two rival financiers for Bell Resources Limited which is controlled by Bell Group 
464c040e The bid forced Mr\. Holmes a Court to call off a proposed merger of the Bell companies 
464c040f That was the turning point said Darryl Smalley a director at the Perth brokerage Hartley Poynton Limited 
464c040g Finally there\'s the welfare problem 
464c040h Not all workers are as lucky as Joseph 
464c040i Some get sick or injured and lose their jobs 
464c040j [tongue_click] Others who turned their life savings over to brokers in order to get here discover that promises of money meals and lodging were bogus 
464c040k [lip_smack] Fear of deportation prevents them from going to the police for help 
464c040l [lip_smack] There are unconfirmed reports of workers starving to death here 
464c040m But some argue Agenda could be a big hit and create a new category of software 
464c040n [tongue_click] This is fundamentally new and different 
464c040o [lip_smack] It\'s tremendously exciting says Esther Dyson editor of Release one \.POINT oh a newsletter that covers computer software 
464c040p I think it\'s an extremely useful tool says Mort Rosenthal chairman of Corporate Software Inc\. a Westwood Massachusetts based software distributor 
464c040q He says he uses Agenda more than any other software 
464c040r Imperial says it has had terrific unsolicited interest in the material from all areas of plastics uses 
464c040s But the cost of manufacturing the natural plastic is prohibitively expensive fifteen dollars a pound compared with roughly sixty five cents a pound for conventional plastic 
464c040t However the company says it hopes to reduce manufacturing costs enough to begin marketing the plastic in two to five years 
464c040u [lip_smack] Mr\. *Hefter* of Jefferies says investors are basically picking some stocks in which they have situations going that they have a definite idea about 
464c040v But in general the wait and see attitude is still very prevalent out there 
464c040w There is no real pressure to jump into the market right now 
464c040x Mr\. Bethell has an eye for the fashionable and for the abominable which today are often the same thing 
464c040y He obviously relishes a good fight and says no to the cultural barbarians . and the current wisdom 
464c040z [lip_smack] He uses pig bladder hammer and tongs and scalpel and he is adept with them all as The Electric Windmill shows 
464c0410 The big attraction is that the nineteen eighty eight Summer Olympics aren\'t really being held in the summer 
464c0411 G\. M\. which has lost about eight \%PERCENT of the U\. S\. car market in recent years figures the games\' late September timing is ideal 
464c0412 It also hopes the games will attract upscale viewers who normally don\'t tune into sports 
464c0413 During the campaign as in earlier ones a few low and middle ranking officials were arrested or dismissed 
464c0414 [tongue_click] But no leading cadres or their family members were punished fueling cynicism among the masses 
464c0415 And the corruption problem seemed only to get worse 
464c0416 Getting the deal right is the key 
464c0417 Unlike warrants on Japanese stocks deals for U\. S\. companies aren\'t really covered by the ownership of underlying shares 
464c0418 Instead underwriters use what they call a dynamic hedge 
464c0419 [lip_smack] Each is different but usually involves a combination of stock option purchases arranged by the home office in New York 
464c041a Some of that cash has been used for bonus payments 
464c041b Wages and bonuses rose nineteen \%PERCENT in the first half a rate that far outpaced economic growth and exerted upward pressure on prices 
464c041c China\'s economy grew at an annual rate of five \.POINT seven \%PERCENT in the first six months roughly half the average annual rate in the past decade 
465c0201 *Wickes* had made its friendly offer for Lear *Siegler* to help its Santa Monica neighbor ward off A\. F\. G\. Partners\' initial takeover bid last month 
465c0202 But *Wickes* which had signed an agreement to acquire Lear for one \.POINT seven billion dollars backed off after having problems arranging financing on satisfactory terms 
465c0203 *Wickes* has declined comment since saying that it was officially continuing efforts to arrange financing but wasn\'t optimistic about its chances 
465c0204 The administration has occasionally mouthed complaints about the Private Express Statutes the laws that prohibit free choice in mail service but has done little aside from talk 
465c0205 The White House intervened earlier last year to stop the Postal Service from banning private companies from shipping bundles of letters overseas to be deposited directly in foreign mail systems 
465c0206 But this was fairly minor 
465c0207 The government civil suit alleged that a defect could cause the rear brakes to lock sending the car spinning out of control 
465c0208 G\. M\. which no longer makes X\. cars denied that the brakes are defective 
465c0209 Agreeing with G\. M\. Judge Jackson ruled that the government came to court with \"DOUBLE\-QUOTE nothing more essentially than a reasonable suspicion \"DOUBLE\-QUOTE that a defect existed 
465c020a By now there is little else Mr\. Falcigno can do to hype attendance 
465c020b That doesn\'t mean he doesn\'t have other worries 
465c020c Counterfeit tickets have been a problem although a new type of ticket with a special edge and weave seems to have provided a temporary solution

465c020h The reaction from the free world she wrote and the leaders who call themselves democrats has been little 
465c020i The seven signatories have agreed to policies aimed at reducing their internal and external imbalances 
465c020j Thus they are making a contribution to stabilizing their exchange relations jeopardized by the highly excessive deficits and surpluses that have developed in recent years 
465c020k Moreover they are ready if need be to intervene on exchange markets 
465c020l Analyst Thomas Rooney of Donaldson Lufkin and Jenrette got scores of calls from clients about the rumors 
465c020m He estimates Prime\'s domestic business may be off twenty \%PERCENT to twenty five \%PERCENT with foreign sales up by about the same percentage 
465c020n Domestic sales accounted for about half of Prime\'s nineteen eighty seven revenue 
465c020o As a result the government is talking of higher farm prices 
465c020p But higher farm prices would add to an already steep inflation rate 
465c020q So Beijing officials reportedly talk of tying wages to inflation an idea reminiscent of the wage indexation tried in some Latin American nations several years ago with disastrous results 
465c020r The agreement calls for Dover to make a tender offer for Chief Automotive\'s eight \.POINT three million shares outstanding

465c020w Money to promote a flagging global corporate computer service is becoming available 
465c020x So is support for a beefed up team of deal makers to broker mergers among California companies 
465c020y None of these areas however hold the prospect of quick growth 
465c020z So far the administration has ignored these appeals and so have Mr\. Reed and other bankers 
465c0210 It seems that the principles enunciated at the beginning of this decade by Messrs\. 
465c0211 Wriston and Theobald still prevail if not in lending the bank\'s money at least in suggesting that other investors put up the cash 
465c0212 However conventional film will be marginally profitable at best for Polaroid because initially Polaroid won\'t be manufacturing the film contends Elliott Novak an industry consultant 
465c0213 Instead it will buy the film from another company and put its name on it just as it does with videotape 
465c0214 Since it began selling videotape a few years ago Polaroid has built up an impressive twelve \%PERCENT market share making it the leader in the U\. S\. 
465c0215 But fierce competition has kept videotape profits slim and the conventional film business isn\'t likely to prove any bonanza either 
465c0216 Reacting to the erosion of Confucian values many Koreans are turning to religion especially Christianity

465c0304 As a result many insurance issues are down ten \%PERCENT to twenty five \%PERCENT from their highs [loud_breath] reached mostly last spring 
465c0305 The bulls argue however that sellers are leaving the party too soon 
465c0306 For one thing they say the large premium increases of the past few years have only begun to appear in insurers\' *bottom* lines 
465c0307 For nineteen eighty seven earnings gains of twenty five \%PERCENT to more than fifty \%PERCENT from nineteen eighty six levels are almost a certainty at these companies 
465c0308 And most analysts expect the earnings growth to continue albeit at a more modest rate in nineteen eighty eight 
465c0309 However one source close to the companies said he wouldn\'t rule out the possibility of Limited buying I\. Magnin 
465c030a Limited Chairman Leslie H\. Wexner has said he is interested in operating a specialty department store 
465c030b Limited operates such stores as Limited Limited Express Lane Bryant Henri Bendel and Victoria\'s Secret 
465c030c To get around that requirement insurers can pay a reinsurer to assume part of the risk of loss on the annuity in return for part of the premium 
465c030d But most reinsurance contracts don\'t transfer investment risk the risk of failing to earn enough to pay the promised rates 
465c030e That\'s where First Executive which has relied heavily on reinsurance to support expansion of it business and the regulators haven\'t agreed on the proper form of contract 
465c030f The Kroh brothers mismanaged but it was not for the purpose of lining their own pockets he says

466c040n The point a point Mr\. Campbell keeps returning to is that every religion is true 
466c040o It\'s true as a metaphor for the human and cosmic mysteries 
466c040p It\'s only when you\'re stuck on the metaphor that you get in trouble 
466c040q Mr\. Howard not only helped the fledgling public companies drum up interest in their shares he helped invest the capital they raised in the public offerings 
466c040r In many cases the banks he advised invested large amounts in each other 
466c040s And they lent funds to other clients of Mr\. Howard who sometimes invested in the same stocks 
466c040t Acquired in nineteen seventy nine Friendly reported modest growth until last year when labor shortages and lower consumer traffic hurt the chain 
466c040u The unit improved sales with higher prices new store openings and the acquisition of two small restaurant chains during the second half of nineteen eighty six

466c0410 We\'ve always wondered how to square Nicaraguan [door_slam] President Daniel Ortega\'s rough words with his soft treatment in the Democratic controlled U\. S\. Congress 
466c0411 Maybe he has too because he\'s upped the ante 
466c0412 He has now branded not only the Republicans but also the Democrats as imperialists because both parties have talked recently about helping the Contras 
466c0413 What do the Democrats become if they actually vote the bandages 
466c0414 The Treasury is scheduled to announce details of its quarterly financing operation November two 
466c0415 It usually consists of three year notes ten year notes and thirty year bonds 
466c0416 But the department is very close to reaching its limits on issuing long term debt and thus has asked Congress to increase its authority 
466c0417 Congress still hasn\'t completed work on the issue which is part of the b- tax bill passed late Tuesday by the Senate 
466c0418 Clarke Swanson noting that nineteen million women had stayed in the work force after World War two thought they could use help in whipping up quick meals 
466c0419 So in nineteen fifty one the Swanson company began selling frozen pot pies turkey chicken and meat 
466c041a The first production order called for twenty thousand pies 
466c041b Soon it was two hundred fifty thousand a day 
466c041c By nineteen fifty three Clarke and his brother were ready for the next step complete frozen dinners

467c0201 [lip_smack] First of all the policy conservatives will pursue their unfinished agenda of deregulation in areas from financial services to regulation as a drag on U\. S\. international competitiveness 
467c0202 They say the administration missed its chance and allowed its deregulatory campaign to be all but aborted by controversy over Anne Gorsuch and Jim Watt 
467c0203 They think their general case in this area is overwhelming 
467c0204 They will give it new applications and carry it to new forums 
467c0205 The new service differs from the shuttle in several ways 
467c0206 It won\'t have the backup planes that the shuttle uses to accommodate passenger overflow 
467c0207 The new flights will include advance seat selection and first class and coach service which the shuttle doesn\'t 
467c0208 Shuttle flights depart on the hour the new service will operate on the half hour 
467c0209 Mr\. Gittis said the lawsuits would have little influence on the response of Revlon\'s board to the tender offer 
467c020a He said MacAndrews and Forbes rather than Revlon is borrowing the money needed to acquire Revlon and take it private 
467c020b We\'re selling eight hundred million of notes in a private placement he said 
467c020c If we were using Revlon assets the suits could be troublesome 
467c020d Still Mr\. Josephs and others think that the changes will be good for the farm economy in general 
467c020e Many of these gentlemen farmers were tax motivated not profit driven he says 
467c020f [lip_smack] Some are unfair competition against the regular farmer who\'s trying to make a buck 
467c020g About two weeks ago Southland acknowledged that it was considering restructuring alternatives but wouldn\'t elaborate 
467c020h The owner and operator of eighty two hundred seven Eleven stores repeatedly has said it didn\'t know of reasons for the heavy trading in its stock 
467c020i But stock traders continued to expect Southland to take some action even while several analysts and industry executives said they believed Southland wouldn\'t respond unless a hostile bidder emerged

467c020k [lip_smack] The new unions are growing more adversarial 
467c020l Companies keep asking the government to smash the unions 
467c020m But the ruling party can\'t risk alienating workers who will vote in the coming elections 
467c020n It refuses so far to backtrack on its July one promise of greater democracy or to return to the policy of overt union busting 
467c020o Worlds of Wonder needs to convince creditors to extend it time through the Christmas season which is by far the biggest sales period for toy companies 
467c020p It\'s in the creditors\' best interest to keep the company going at least for now said Fred Anschel an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Incorporated 
467c020q As of September thirty the company\'s inventory was one hundred and twenty eight million a spokeswoman said

467c020t His successor hasn\'t been named 
467c020u BankAmerica is now writing off fewer of its problem loans than most other large banks 
467c020v The development has left some analysts wondering whether being aggressive enough especially considering its record of surprising loan problems over the past three years 
467c020w But bank officials said they are being prudent 
467c020x They said lower write offs reflect previous housecleaning as well as more conservative lending practices 
467c020y In addition the bank has a beefed up team of specialists who are having increasing success in recovering previously written off loans 
467c020z The only new issue priced yesterday was five hundred and fifty million of twelve year senior subordinated debentures from U\. S\. G\. Corp\. 
467c0210 The high risk high yield issue was priced at par to yield thirteen and one quarter \%PERCENT by Salomon Brothers Incorporated and Goldman Sachs and Company 
467c0211 The offering is part of U\. S\. G\.\'s recapitalization plan 
467c0212 Mr\. Zehnder plays down this criticism 
467c0213 He points to the fact that Credit Suisse leads in the number of publicly listed bonds launched but lags in the number of unlisted notes it issued 
467c0214 [lip_smack] This is significant he says because bond issues pay higher commissions than unlisted notes 
467c0215 In contrast Senator Bentsen campaigned last week in a half empty plane to a measured cadence 
467c0216 He portrays Governor Dukakis as a pragmatic can do executive 
467c0217 And he offers himself a business oriented Senate Finance Committee chairman and former insurance executive as evidence of that moderation 
467c0218 The recurring words of his speeches are the words of the boardroom Competence hands on management enhanced recovery 
467c0219 Mr\. Kidder insists there is cause for hope 
467c021a Good teachers put snags in the river of children passing by and over the years they redirect hundreds of lives 
467c021b Perhaps he is right 
467c021c But what he notices at the fifth grade science fair seems more significant 
467c021d The results of that painful charade don\'t reflect social status ethnic background or teaching technique They reflect the contribution of each child\'s parents 
467c021e Aviation insurance is under intense pressure 
467c021f The global airline premiums have dropped to about four hundred million from about one billion in nineteen eighty seven 
467c021g Meanwhile airline losses in nineteen eighty eight rose significantly from the previous year 
467c0301 The economic fallout shouldn\'t be ignored however 
467c0302 A provision in the spending bill requires that at least one third of the repair and overhaul work on ships be done locally at their home ports 
467c0303 That makes it a big deal for Todd and Lockheed Mr\. Dicks says referring to two Puget Sound shipyards 
467c0304 The government civil suit alleged that a defect could cause the rear brakes to lock sending the car spinning out of control 
467c0305 G\. M\. which no longer makes X\. cars denied that the brakes are defective 
467c0306 Agreeing with G\. M\. Judge Jackson ruled that the government came to court with nothing more essentially than a reasonable suspicion that a defect existed 
467c0307 Inco\'s stock has caught technical analysts\' attention too [misc_noise] 
467c0308 It recently broke out of a five year trading range says Martin Pring editor of Pring Market Review 
467c0309 He thinks the stock could be poised for big gains reflecting what may be a bull market in base metals 
467c030a [sniff] Rent control is as bad as the income tax deduction for home ownership 
467c030b All the beneficiaries of the deduction are high income earners not simply some of them 
467c030c It leads to extra large swimming pools extra bedrooms in Beverly Hills but no housing for the people who need it most 
467c030d Still when this issue was last voted on in Congress eighty five out of eighty five senators present voted for it 
467c030e The only surprising thing given the number of beneficiaries is that somehow the other fifteen senators didn\'t manage to get their names on the roll call 
467c030f Mr\. Zinn said Entertainment Marketing is still weighing a proxy fight 
467c030g It\'s a bad feeling in your stomach when the chairman and previous bidder is selling his block he said

467c030i Under the plan the Edelman group would contribute about one hundred million in equity to the transaction

467c030w The king\'s request left the delegates in a tight spot 
467c030x To ignore Jordan and make a substantial formal cash pledge to the P\. L\. O\. would signal a shift away from moderation difficult for the gulf states to countenance

467c030z But other evidence on the flaps is conflicting 
467c0310 [lip_smack] One of the crew members can be heard on a cockpit voice recorder calling out Flaps fifteen fifteen the correct position for the flaps 
467c0311 [tongue_click] And the recorder indicates that a cockpit alarm that should have alerted the crew to improperly set flaps didn\'t go off 
467c0312 When the House and Senate approved the tax bill early Saturday lawmakers didn\'t mention the last minute provisions and congressional staffers described them as technical 
467c0313 While the estimated revenue of almost one hundred million over three years is relatively small the provisions might be perceived as an anti takeover push by Congress 
467c0314 They could have the effect of slowing certain takeover activity congressional sources acknowledged over the weekend 
467c0315 To be sure the deficit has declined in the past few years 
467c0316 But that decline is entirely the result of a rising surplus in the Social Security trust fund 
467c0317 That money should be invested to help defray the future retirement costs of the baby boomers instead it is being used to paper over the deficit 
467c0318 That\'s yet another symptom of Mr\. Darman\'s national now now ism 
467c0319 This year the Soviets have moved commercial sales to the front burner 
467c031a The export arm of the Soviet Ministry of Aviation Industry hopes to double its revenue by the mid nineteen nineties

467c0402 In a narrowly drawn statement vice chairman Herbert Freiman denied Shearson had offered a block to Salomon Brothers which managed the selling brokers\' floor operation 
467c0403 Mr\. Freiman wouldn\'t elaborate 
467c0404 That may be but there are tough calls 
467c0405 Emotional upset headaches backaches and other subjective symptoms are hard to quantify 
467c0406 *Besides* someone who truly feels disabled may as a result actually be disabled 
467c0407 A well timed period of time off with stress reduction and an effort at better understanding may prevent a much worse disability later 
467c0408 It may also uncover factors at the workplace that can be improved 
467c0409 I try to give the patient the benefit of the doubt within reason 
467c040a Not doing so is more than unkind it risks harm to the patient and lawsuits that neither the physician nor employer would welcome

467c040q The dollar\'s fall has pushed up the price of imports causing the deficit to swell even as the volume of non oil imports has receded

468c0202 I\'m dimly aware that they\'re out there says Richard Ullman professor of international affairs at Princeton University and a former editor of Foreign Policy magazine

468c0208 Westinghouse officials told analysts that operating profit in the Industries Group fell fifteen \%PERCENT to twenty \%PERCENT hurt in part by weak results in Canadian operations 
468c0209 A sharp drop in operating profit from the Broadcasting Group\'s production company contributed to the slightly lower operating earnings overall for that segment

468c020k Texas of course is where the most trouble is to be found 
468c020l Lenders there like to blame the so called oil patch recession

468c020n Some parts of Texas the Dallas Fort 
468c020o Worth area for example haven\'t had anything that legitimately could be called a recession 
468c020p The main reason so many lenders are in trouble is an old fashioned failing among bankers a weakness for real estate speculation 
468c020q As a result the government is talking of higher farm prices 
468c020r But higher farm prices would add to an already steep inflation rate

468c021a Britain\'s own markets are more open than those of most European countries London is way ahead of them on capital movement having abolished exchange controls altogether

468c0304 In the past Filipinos in many rural areas preferred the disciplined terror of the N\. P\. A\. to the random excesses of the country\'s military 
468c0305 With the change of government last year a mild improvement in military behavior and the detection of the Mindanao slaughters some Filipinos are changing their minds 
468c0306 Diplomats and political analysts say they don\'t know if the trend . presages significant popular resistance to the Communists or just additional turmoil in the Philippine countryside 
468c0307 There is a wide variation in thinking about how sick one is and how important time off is in order to get well 
468c0308 The patients\' responsibilities outside of work also vary

46cc020k [tongue_click] Also providing some solace for municipal bond professionals is the fact that commercial banks are becoming more active as underwriters rather than as investors 
46cc020l This means they will need to hire more investment bankers 
46cc020m The banks\' move is part of their effort to test and expand the limits of securities and banking laws 
46cc020n Instead Dayton Hudson\'s earnings have been depressed for more than a year by merchandising problems in its Mervyn\'s department store unit 
46cc020o [tongue_click] Analysts said the trouble started with Mervyn\'s concentrating too much on opening new stores and not enough on providing brand name merchandise 
46cc020p Top management was slow to recognize the problems some analysts said 
46cc020q And management has been too optimistic in predicting the timing of a turnaround the analysts said 
46cc020r Wall Street in general has been concerned about G\. M\. in recent weeks because of its new labor contract 
46cc020s The three year pact includes a job security program that prevents layoffs except during a sales drop prevents plant closings and slows attrition 
46cc020t Many analysts predict the provisions will hamper G\. M\.\'s efforts to restructure operations and shed uncompetitive plants particularly in parts operations

46cc0210 [tongue_click] The Cuomo plan doesn\'t stop at gouging New York taxpayers and Long Island ratepayers 
46cc0211 Federal taxpayers also will contribute 
46cc0212 The key to the deal is that Lilco also would get a two \.POINT five billion dollar tax write off for Shoreham 
46cc0213 This would guarantee that the utility won\'t have to pay any federal taxes for at least a decade 
46cc0214 [lip_smack] New York also would help Lilco float one hundred million dollars in tax exempt industrial development bonds to help pay for the cleanup 
46cc0215 Make that de industrialization bonds 
46cc0216 But Mr\. Peterson says there still is an image problem 
46cc0217 If we haven\'t worked with a company before the natural reaction is Why the hell are you bringing in accountants to work in the plant 
46cc0218 Yet we probably have the largest manufacturing consulting practice in the world 
46cc0219 [lip_smack] The reason for the relatively modest incentive programs is that the auto makers are demonstrating a much better ability to keep production in line with sales 
46cc021a Inventories of U\. S\. made cars stood at fifty nine days supply at the end of August according to Ward\'s Automotive Reports an industry trade publication 
46cc021b That is considered a normal supply and it is the lowest stock in twenty two months 
46cc021c Not all black colleges are on the ropes 
46cc021d In fact a number of elite institutions are thriving in part because of their highly successful fund raising efforts 
46cc021e Last week for instance Mr\. Cosby and his wife Camille donated twenty million dollars to Spelman College a black women\'s college in Atlanta 
46cc0301 Borg Warner eased three eighths to forty one and three eighths on six hundred and thirty nine thousand eight hundred shares 
46cc0302 Minstar and Bear Stearns entered into an option agreement for the possible purchase of three million twenty nine thousand two hundred Borg Warner shares 
46cc0303 The purchases would boost Minstar\'s Borg Warner stake to eight \.POINT five \%PERCENT 
46cc0304 Yesterday G\. A\. F\. announced that it has acquired a nine \.POINT nine six \%PERCENT investment stake in Borg Warner 
46cc0305 [lip_smack] Last month Piedmont\'s board recommended that the company accept Norfolk Southern\'s bid to acquire the company for sixty five dollars a share 
46cc0306 Norfolk Southern has a stake in Piedmont since nineteen eighty one 
46cc0307 But one day after the board\'s recommendation U\. S\. Air sweetened its initial bid for Piedmont forcing the board to drop its recommendation 
46cc0308 [lip_smack] In fact given the highly developed U\. S\. transportation infrastructure few if any shippers are truly captive to rails 
46cc0309 The best case is made by electric utilities that have power plants served by coal hauling roads but big utilities don\'t lack bargaining power 
46cc030a For one thing the Staggers Act now allows long term contracts between shippers and railroads 
46cc030b [tongue_click] That incredibly was not allowed under the old law because Congress had once decided [loud_breath] that volume discounts to big shippers were unfair 
46cc030c In drawing up contracts the relevant fact is that both the railroad and the utility need each other 
46cc030d Some utilities particularly in the West have surplus capacity meaning they can switch to other sources if hauling costs at a single plant rise 
46cc030e [tongue_click] During testimony in April Federal Trade Commission Chairman Daniel Oliver said the legislation would restrain competition

46cc030h When the market was roaring it was stupid to have cash says the fund manager at a major Japanese trust bank 
46cc030i But now it isn\'t so bad 
46cc030j And Salomon\'s Mr\. Napier says Everyone is getting into cash right now and waiting 
46cc030k Bond traders also were cheered by another drop in oil futures prices the seventh decline in the past eight sessions 
46cc030l The drop has indicated to some analysts that inflation fears were greatly exaggerated 
46cc030m [tongue_click] Previously oil prices had surged above twenty two dollars a barrel largely on fear that growing tension in the Persian Gulf might lead to a disruption of oil supplies 
46cc030n It also increases the likelihood of defections from Hill Samuel\'s one hundred and thirty member corporate finance group according to insiders and officials of other banks 
46cc030o As part of T\. S\. B\. the department mainly would serve small companies in the United Kingdom

46cc030u Voting had resumed on Saturday 
46cc030v The government is now poring over Mr\. Seow\'s financial affairs asking how he\'s been paying his phone bills these past ten years 
46cc030w Similar inquiries led to the expulsion from Parliament last December of Joshua B\. Jeyaretnam leaving only one opposition M\. P\. 
46cc030x A team candidate proposal now under study would also seem l- likely to keep the opposition from finding its way into government office 
46cc030y But Singapore\'s two \.POINT six million citizens aren\'t likely to benefit quite so much as the politicians of Mr\. Lee\'s ruling party 
46cc030z Cotton Futures prices for cotton from the current crop rose on buying mostly by traders who follow chart signals 
46cc0310 The advance in turn pulled up prices f- of delivery months representing the new crop season which will begin August the first 
46cc0311 The July delivery rose one \.POINT five nine cents a pound to sixty four \.POINT four eight cents 
46cc0312 [lip_smack] The October contract was up \.POINT five eighths of a cent to sixty \.POINT three six cents a pound 
46cc0313 One analyst observed that new crop contracts were under pressure earlier in the day because of the perception that moisture in the Mississippi Delta might be heavier than needed 
46cc0314 But later in the session traders changed their minds he said deciding that rain might not be adequate 
46cc0315 He scored a big triumph early this year pushing aside local bureaucrats who wanted to share his spoils in a one billion dollar freeway being built in Guangdong province

46cc0318 Indonesia and the Philippines are so impressed that they have asked him to build similar plants 
46cc0319 Many admirers believe firmly that if anyone can get business done in China Mr\. Wu can 
46cc031a To begin with companies have been doing a good job of managing inventories 
46cc031b In the past businesses have tended to become increasingly optimistic as expansions persisted 
46cc031c When sales eventually slowed inventories quickly reached excessive levels 
46cc031d Companies thereupon cut their buying industrial production declined and a recession was under way 
46cc031e One of the affinity cards that Chemical Bank dropped was marketed to alumni of New York University 
46cc031f We were satisfied with the program while it was running says Robert Cunningham director of alumni relations at N\. Y\. U\. 
46cc031g But it ended at Chemical\'s suggestion 
46cc0401 Occidental officals say the mine will start commercial operations next September more than two years behind schedule 
46cc0402 The mine is expected to produce between thirteen million and thirteen \.POINT five million tons of steaming coal annually used at electric generating plants says Mr\. Ogden 
46cc0403 All but ten \%PERCENT of the output is for export mostly to Japan South Korea and Hong Kong 
46cc0404 So far illegal foreign workers aren\'t taken as a job threat by Japanese workers 
46cc0405 [lip_smack] But Japanese unemployment is at historically high levels because of the yen\'s strength posing a knotty problem for the government 
46cc0406 Many Japanese companies in such industries as steel and shipbuilding are cutting their labor forces 
46cc0407 Brokerage stocks have been wilting for months but Mr\. Chanos thinks they could get hit later this year if other firms report down quarters 
46cc0408 Salomon\'s stock dived eleven \%PERCENT on huge volume Monday casting a temporary pall over the whole group 
46cc0409 It closed yesterday at thirty nine and seven eighths up one eighth 
46cc040a The Broderick men are attracted to Leah because she is an honest woman in a world of pretense and artifice 
46cc040b [tongue_click] She can manipulate ideology and image to further radical causes but she doesn\'t confuse her political stratagems with reality 
46cc040c Indeed she has no personal devotion to those causes they are simply vehicles for her professional skills 
46cc040d This fascinates and baffles the men around her 
46cc040e [tongue_click] Another reason Mr\. Soifer is avoiding Morgan and Citicorp is that their stock prices at times have tended to gyrate more violently than other bank issues 
46cc040f [lip_smack] Citicorp and Morgan tend to have more volatility on days when program trading is known to occur Mr\. Soifer says 
46cc040g They\'re more of a bet on which way the market is headed 
46cc040h Although OPEC has toyed with voluntary quotas for several years it didn\'t really become serious about production curbs until after last year\'s collapse in oil prices 
46cc040i Member countries continue to argue however over the fairness of their nineteen eighty seven quotas and each has reason to report less than it is producing 
46cc040j The problem says a senior OPEC official is that rigid quotas are incompatible with a flexible oil market

46cc040o The profitability of that business has been declining for years Mr\. Wooden said 
46cc040p It was through these correspondent banks that Manufacturers got all of these energy loans that have soured 
46cc040q [lip_smack] However one Manufacturers executive said he doubted correspondent banking would be eliminated in light of that business\'s improved performance recently 
46cc040r The point a point Mr\. Campbell keeps returning to is that every religion is true 
46cc040s It\'s true as a metaphor for the human and cosmic mysteries

46cc040u Mr\. Smith said trading in British Aerospace shares would resume early today on London\'s stock exchange 
46cc040v Trading was suspended at four hundred and seventy pence or seven dollars and ninety five cents Wednesday

46cc0412 As for the prices Cargill charges he adds We\'re trying to get the maximum price for our products all the time 
46cc0413 Viewers and critics say the huge load of ads and airtime is part of the problem 
46cc0414 Commercial clutter seems greater than in previous Olympics broadcasts many critics say 
46cc0415 The coverage between ads some complain is fragmented and shifty jumping too quickly among myriad sports 
46cc0416 [lip_smack] Actual events as opposed to taped profiles previews and reports take up less than half of the airtime

46cc041a The chips are rapidly gaining popularity among computer makers and the one that gets the most converts could become a de facto standard in tomorrow\'s computer industry 
46cc041b [tongue_click] The Senate Judiciary Committee on a seven to seven vote last month effectively killed Mr\. Lucas\'s nomination to head the department\'s civil rights division 
46cc041c A majority was needed to send the nomination to the full Senate 
46cc041d Democratic members of the committee criticized President Bush and Mr\. Thornburgh for nominating Mr\. Lucas who has little experience as a lawyer and none as a civil rights litigator 
46dc0201 The lack of market depth yesterday enabled several large buy orders to spark the dollar rally 
46dc0202 One New York trader said he witnessed the currency\'s value jump as his bank executed a purchase order for two hundred and fifty million dollars in several chunks 
46dc0203 When there are very few players that kind of order will move the market said the trader who asked not to be identified

46dc020n Mr\. Leming a chemicals analyst issued his report June twenty second with Seagram trading at seventy seven 
46dc020o It closed yesterday at seventy six and three eighths up one and seven eighths 
46dc020p This reasoning has clearly failed to galvanize the market 
46dc020q Mr\. Leming didn\'t return calls seeking comment yesterday 
46dc020r Analysts also said they hadn\'t expected lower operating profits for the company\'s Industries Group and for the broadcasting segment 
46dc020s Westinghouse officials told analysts that operating profit in the Industries Group fell fifteen \%PERCENT to twenty \%PERCENT hurt in part by weak results in Canadian operations 
46dc020t A sharp drop in operating profit from the Broadcasting Group\'s production company contributed to the slightly lower operating earnings overall for that segment

46dc020x Mr\. Forbes said he\'d had no communication with anyone from the I\. R\. S\. trying to dissuade him from publishing such a story 
46dc020y I assure you that Forbes doesn\'t kill stories at the request of the I\. R\. S\. or anyone else he said 
46dc020z Indeed he added Such a call would almost ensure the appearance of such a story 
46dc0210 Mr\. Forbes said he would be hard put to think of the commissioner\'s name 
46dc0211 However the long siege of corporate cost cutting has already slashed corporate payrolls so severely that many companies have significantly reduced their break even levels of operations 
46dc0212 In effect they already are operating as if in a recession so layoffs might prove relatively modest 
46dc0213 [sniff] In addition the role of manufacturing in the economy has faded in comparison with the growth of recession resistant service jobs 
46dc0214 In most modern nations it\'s not considered a threat to national security when critics of the government decide to run for political office 
46dc0215 [tongue_click] Nor is it subversive to embarrass the prime minister and his administration 
46dc0216 Sad to say in Singapore this seems reason enough to invoke the Internal Security Act

46dc0301 The biggest danger economists say is a free fall of the dollar 
46dc0302 That would force the U\. S\. to raise interest rates to attract the foreign capital needed to finance its current account deficit and indirectly its budget deficit 
46dc0303 Higher rates in turn could plunge the U\. S\. and possibly the world into a recession that could threaten the international financial system 
46dc0304 Fujitsu\'s bid for control of Fairchild Semiconductor has left the Pentagon divided

46dc030g But John Smale P\. and G\'s chairman and chief executive used the meeting to speak at length about hostile takeovers in general 
46dc030h He maintained that too often they leave companies loaded with debt and shrunken research budgets and ignore the interests of employees and the communities in which the companies do business 
46dc030i He also argued that over the long run hostile takeovers don\'t necessarily provide a good mechanism for shareholders to realize full value for their shares

46dc0406 [tongue_click] The estimate is based on an increase in output of one \.POINT four \%PERCENT and an increase in hours worked of one \.POINT one \%PERCENT

46dc040c Before a six million dollar loss from discontinued operations Phillips had profit from continuing operations of seventeen million dollars or five cents a share 
46dc040d That profit included a twelve million dollar gain from asset sales and an eight million dollar charge from staff reductions 
46dc040e Much of the litigation involving business brokers centers on the larger better staffed concerns concerns like Business Buyers 
46dc040f [tongue_click] That company which exclusively represents buyers says it has signed more than two hundred and fifty clients since it opened in nineteen eighty two

46dc040i However these legislators are worried about the details that might be included in the report

46dc040p President Eugene Sapp runs the company on a day to day basis and he does so in a no frills atmosphere 
46dc040q For example company cars planes and country p- club memberships are taboo 
46dc040r On Friday Shearson Lehman Brothers Incorporated said it is easing program trading for its own account 
46dc040s We don\'t want to be part of the problem said Jeffrey Lane president of Shearson 
46dc040t [tongue_click] Mr\. Lane said he would rather see Wall Street modify its behavior than have Washington regulators clamp down 
46dc040u We\'re giving up short term gains for the good of our clients he asserted 
46dc040v I think it\'s a perfectly honorable profession 
46dc040w If more of us did it the opportunities would get smaller because more firms would be competing to close the same spreads he says 
46dc040x The product is an legitimate hedging product and a legitimate way to add liquidity to the market 
46dc040y Unlike traditional whole life policies in which the premium and death benefit are fixed universal life gives holders considerable latitude to vary their payments and benefits 
46dc040z But it has limited guarantees and much investment risk is transferred to the holder 
46dc0410 Premium dollars are invested in the saving portion of the plan and money is deducted periodically to pay for administrative expenses and the insurance coverage 
46dc0411 Prices at the mass retail level however haven\'t risen much in a decade partly because big retailers use tennis balls to lure shoppers 
46dc0412 [tongue_click] I remember purchasing a can of balls for two dollars in nineteen sixty seven says Walter L\. Henry a Pittsburgh recreational player 
46dc0413 Two weeks ago I picked up a can for a dollar eighty nine 
46dc0414 [tongue_click] David Meister F\. N\. N\.\'s president acknowledged the company has been in discussions with other media concerns but he declined to identify them 
46dc0415 [tongue_click] We\'ve spoken to virtually every company you can imagine plus half a dozen more you wouldn\'t think of Mr\. Meister said 
46dc0416 He denied industry speculation that F\. N\. N\. is looking to sell the company 
46dc0417 We\'re not interested in selling and we\'re not soliciting anything he said 
46dc0418 However he added that\'s not to say we wouldn\'t entertain any reasonable offer for at least a piece of F\. N\. N\. 
46dc0419 Peter DaPuzzo head of retail trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton also looks for a sharp upward move in stock prices given a few ifs 
46dc041a One is if investors don\'t get spooked at the anniversary of the crash 
46dc041b Another is if the Federal Reserve eases interest rates 
46dc041c And a third is if George Bush wins the presidential election 
46dc041d Food buyers for one Texas supermarket chain Furr\'s Incorporated have even asked five hundred dollars just to make an appointment according to one manufacturer 
46dc041e I just laughed said the sales manager of a Southern California candy company who refused the demand 
46dc041f Furr\'s wouldn\'t confirm or deny the claim 
46ec0201 How is Wall Street reacting to the changes 
46ec0202 Some investment bankers feel threatened by it others scoff at suggestion that these efforts are truly competitive 
46ec0203 But some say the case isn\'t clear 
46ec0204 Few developers are big enough to justify the cost of these divisions 
46ec0205 The test will be whether the new units are adding value to their organizations 
46ec0206 If not one investment banker says the partners will kill them 
46ec0207 Some were quite vehement in resisting any change 
46ec0208 If a company did this I wouldn\'t follow them anymore said one New York analyst 
46ec0209 Issuers of abbreviated annual reports are really showing contempt for the typical shareholder said another 
46ec020a One North Korean assertion does have a certain scary credibility to it 
46ec020b North Korea says that blowing up an expensive dam to flood the South would be a waste of good explosives 
46ec020c To do the job would take a blast equivalent to a nuclear bomb 
46ec020d Better to drop it directly on Seoul 
46ec020e [tongue_click] That would be a hundred times better in destructive effect says Li Choong Sung the vice chairman of the North Korean power commission

46ec020p Some wonder whether all the conversions don\'t make Mr\. Beregovoy more of an opportunist than a believer in the market economy 
46ec020q But his aides say he was convinced he was doing the right thing 
46ec020r Mr\. Beregovoy said I\'m not ashamed of what I do 
46ec020s Mr\. Giordano of Goldman Sachs partly agrees 
46ec020t [lip_smack] If investors saw the world like I see the world they\'d be in a defensive portfolio position he said 
46ec020u We could get all of the rise in interest rates expected in the next six months within the next six weeks he asserts 
46ec020v Still Mr\. Love thinks he has the worst behind him 
46ec020w Permiam has bottomed out he says but he\'s using Intergroup\'s investment bankers to sound out prospective buyers anyway 
46ec020x To bolster the balance sheet he\'s also attempting to reach agreement later this year to sell to Japan\'s N\. K\. K\. the other half of its steel holdings 
46ec020y Wells Fargo\'s arrival was announced in a memo to First RepublicBank employees yesterday by Albert V\. Casey its chairman and chief executive officer 
46ec020z He told employees that the F\. D\. I\. C\. asked us to allow a delegation from Wells Fargo to examine the bank 
46ec0210 We shall fully cooperate with their contingent 
46ec0211 He also said that bank regulators are seeking additional information from the Texas bank about its own capitalization plan 
46ec0212 He predicted that it will be a few weeks before we learn whether the F\. D\. I\. C\. has chosen our plan or another one 
46ec0213 Banks that commit to the new credit by today get a fee equal to \.POINT three seven five \%PERCENT of the amount they commit 
46ec0214 It won\'t be clear until after the weekend how many commitments have been received 
46ec0215 But some bankers close to the transaction estimate that about eighty \%PERCENT or slightly more than four billion dollars would be committed by early next week 
46ec0216 Overall consumer spending has slowed since last year\'s *stock* market crash but it\'s still at a level that worries some economists 
46ec0217 Consumer credit slowed sharply in July reflecting sluggish sales 
46ec0218 Too much spending at home coupled with heavy demand for exports could overload an industrial sector that is already running near capacity 
46ec0219 Some banking analysts doubt a London or Tokyo bank would make a similar acquisition anytime here soon 
46ec021a Among other things some foreign banks have been shying away from acquiring assets in the U\. S\. because of unexpectedly high expenses managing them from afar 
46ec021b Instead the trend among foreign banks is to increasingly build alliances with U\. S\. banks 
46ec021c Their infant son was admitted to a hospital critically ill and was misdiagnosed as an abuse victim 
46ec021d He died and the grieving parents were subjected to a criminal investigation

46ec0304 U\. S\. utilities could also increase orders of foreign uranium ahead of any total import restrictions analysts say 
46ec0305 Uranium from South Africa for example has already fallen under anti apartheid sanctions 
46ec0306 But last year said the Uranium Institute U\. S\. imports of South African uranium surged three hundred \%PERCENT to more than thirteen \.POINT two million pounds

46ec030d Several owners of contemporary art galleries say they are nervous about the aftershocks of the stock market\'s fall but they still haven\'t seen much damage 
46ec030e I\'m sure this will have some effect on my business says dealer John Weber in New York 
46ec030f I can anticipate that corporate buying of art will be affected down the pike 
46ec030g [lip_smack] But I\'m not jumping out a window

46ec030p David Hockney has been a kind of Wunderkind on the international art scene since he burst upon it in his native Britain in the late nineteen fifties 
46ec030q He is now fifty years old and this mid career retrospective at the Los Angeles County Museum makes clear once again how precocious and prolific he has been 
46ec030r In fact the profusion and variety of Mr\. Hockney\'s work [loud_breath] seem to have given the show\'s organizers some problems with its presentation 
46ec030s For although Mr\. Hockney\'s talent and originality are generally acknowledged he is regarded in some quarters as more of a gifted illustrator than a major artist 
46ec030t And since in recent years his work has tended to be increasingly decorative a chronological arrangement was apparently thought to be too risky

46ec030x Certain elements of a national system were obvious and quickly made their way into use 
46ec030y The first was a composite tape that brought information from various market centers onto one ticker tape 
46ec030z A composite quotation display system soon followed allowing customers and brokers to see quotes from all markets on a single screen 
46ec0310 And an International Market Trading System allowed orders coming to various exchange floors to flow from one exchange to another quickly easily and at no cost 
46ec0311 Mr\. Kavner said the rival group lacks a clear process for resolving differences 
46ec0312 In addition he said A\. T\. and T\. spends far more each year on developing Unix than the Open Software Foundation has indicated it will spend 
46ec0313 He added that A\. T\. and T\. plans to incorporate into its Unix any useful features from its rivals\' version

46ec0401 Chicago Central and Pacific is one of a slew of new railroads that are being created as major railroads sell lightly used tracks 
46ec0402 More than a hundred and fifty of them have been formed since nineteen eighty compared with forty seven during the nineteen seventies the Federal Railroad Administration says 
46ec0403 Most are short lines with fewer than a hundred miles and some are much longer regional lines of more than five hundred miles 
46ec0404 The state sets the official rate currently two hundred zlotys to the dollar

46ec0408 They seem content to let the Poles trade their lettuce 
46ec0409 Sooner or later Pewex will get most of it anyway 
46ec040a All indications suggest though that the Reagan Nakasone summit will not be about monetary policies 
46ec040b They will discuss trade issues which are certainly important but rather remote from the immediate problem 
46ec040c All of the world\'s exports and imports come to about two trillion a year

46ec040i A painstakingly crafted federal blueprint envisaged states clustering into a dozen or so regional compacts [loud_breath] each with its own disposal site 
46ec040j But states have run into enormous political environmental and economic obstacles in trying to put together these agreements

46ec0410 Plunging into a market most investors are struggling to escape Henley spends six million dollars 
46ec0411 For ten days it buys two out of every three Santa Fe shares traded and lifts its stake to fourteen \%PERCENT from five \%PERCENT 
46ec0412 Santa Fe doesn\'t make a move which Mr\. Dingman takes as a sign of weakness 
46ec0413 If I were in their shoes I\'d be buying my damned stock he argues 
46ec0414 As Japan\'s financial markets have grown and become more international so has foreign pressure on Japan to clean up what many perceive as unfair trading practices 
46ec0415 As a start Japan revised its Securities and Exchange Law last May 
46ec0416 Now the Finance Ministry is writing the definitions and guidelines that will give the new law muscle when it goes into effect next April 
46ec0417 And journalists security analysts and some corporate officials are concerned about the ministry\'s first draft 
46ec0418 In a related matter a review commission administrative law judge on October eighteen threw out OSHA citations against Morrell 
46ec0419 The citations issued in April nineteen eighty seven charged record keeping violations 
46ec041a The official disallowed OSHA\'s instance by instance citation which proposed a total fine of six hundred and ninety thousand dollars

46fc0201 [lip_smack] Indeed to investors all shares of the same stock are alike the investor doesn\'t care which one he buys

46fc020c Construction of the Soviet Union\'s Washington Embassy was completed by nineteen seventy nine before work on the U\. S\.\'s new Moscow Embassy had even started 
46fc020d The Soviets then pushed to occupy their new site but the U\. S\. resisted until its own buildings were ready 
46fc020e As the U\. S\. buildings were completed in Moscow the Soviets were allowed to move into some of their new facilities on Mount Alto

46fc0218 Doctor Zagury said his vaccine should be considered a prototype for testing but whether it confers protection against AIDS hasn\'t been proved 
46fc0219 The ultimate test of efficacy exposing the vaccinated subjects to the live AIDS virus hasn\'t been done for ethical reasons 
46fc021a However the next step is to test a vaccine in a large group of volunteers who are at high risk of being exposed to the virus 
46fc021b Doctor Zagury said he is trying to streamline his booster procedure to make it more widely applicable 
46fc021c Oddly and sadly neither candidate has talked much about this issue 
46fc021d Maybe it doesn\'t lend itself to slogans 
46fc021e Maybe Messrs\.

46fc021g Maybe it\'s an issue the candidates haven\'t thought about 
46fc0301 We have a severe business situation because of the yen\'s appreciation and trade friction an official of Brother Industries says 
46fc0302 In mid nineteen seventy seven the company will be making electronic typewriters in Bartlett Tennessee 
46fc0303 It set up a similar plant in Wales in nineteen eighty five 
46fc0304 In addition to the war of nerves over discounts retail executives said this Christmas season has been characterized by the absence of a big hit in the toy department 
46fc0305 But retailers have seen strong sales of big ticket items to well heeled customers 
46fc0306 They are buying to beat the new tax law which will end the deduction of sales taxes and some interest expenses 
46fc0307 Bally\'s drive into the hotel casino industry has made health clubs an increasingly awkward fit analysts said and thus the most likely candidate for divestiture 
46fc0308 By shedding the health club line Bally could focus on its remaining operations gambling machines state lotteries and amusement centers 
46fc0309 Analysts also question the fit of the company\'s theme parks though saying a sale of that operation could follow

46fc030f Though the filing complicates the battle most experts believe neither company will emerge the winner 
46fc030g The court was split on both the Williams Act and commerce clause 
46fc030h Justice Lewis Powell acknowledged that the nineteen eighty two case of Edgar V\. 
46fc030i Mite suggested that any state law that favored targets more than did the Williams Act would be invalid because Congress had preempted local regulations 
46fc030j [tongue_click] The court backtracked here to say state laws might be O\. K\. if they help the Williams Act\'s purpose by heaping even more burdens on acquirers 
46fc030k The system isn\'t a hundred \%PERCENT perfect but it\'s working reasonably well a Foreign Ministry official told reporters 
46fc030l The official said the U\. S\. has been similarly reassured 
46fc030m Even so the U\. S\. has indicated that it wants Japan to take better care of how Japanese technology is sold around the world 
46fc030n Another incentive that food processors cite for getting into the restaurant business is the high cost of introducing new grocery items 
46fc030o Starting a new brand can easily cost General Mills more than twenty million dollars in development and promotion costs 
46fc030p Of course the Olive Garden start up brick and mortar and all has cost five times that

46fc030s But union officials said the company has tossed around numbers from sixteen hundred to two thousand 
46fc030t As a result the government is talking of higher farm prices 
46fc030u But higher farm prices would add to an already steep inflation rate 
46fc030v So Beijing officials reportedly talk of tying wages to inflation an idea reminiscent of the wage indexation tried in some Latin American nations several years ago with disastrous result(s)- ~ 
46fc030w But U\. S\. manufacturers who took a beating during the first half of this decade continue to enjoy a roaring revival that began last year 
46fc030x As a result there is growing evidence that factory wage and price increases are accelerating 
46fc030y And that could lead the Fed to boost interest rates in an effort to cool down the economy in the coming months

46fc0312 Kukje hopes the Olympics will help give Pro Specs a foothold in Europe 
46fc0313 The new emphasis on making schools work has pushed aside some other longstanding school debates

46hc0215 [loud_breath] But PepsiCo feels *its* territories can be better exploited due to their proximity to exisiting company owned bottlers 
46hc0216 [tongue_click] It owns its Los Angeles and San Francisco bottlers for instance making the central California territory a good fit 
46hc0217 It also already owns its bottlers in central and northern Florida and parts of Georgia 
46hc0218 There are some great opportunities to maximize production and marketing efficiencies the PepsiCo spokesman said 
46hc0219 Peter DaPuzzo head of retailing trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton also looks for a sharp upward move in stock prices given a few ifs 
46hc021a One is if investors don\'t get spooked at the anniversary of the crash 
46hc021b Another is if the Federal Reserve eases interest rates 
46hc021c And a third is if George Bush wins the presidential election 
46hc021d But Service Merchandise jumped one and three eighths to eighteen and a quarter on one \.POINT four million shares 
46hc021e The stock slid to twelve and a quarter in September after the company announced that an investor group had decided not to proceed with a possible acquisition offer 
46hc021f Since then the stock has been rising on takeover rumors 
46hc0301 Mr\. Hu Yaobang was dumped in January as the Communist Party\'s secretary general Mr\. Zhao was elevated to that post on an acting basis 
46hc0302 That made Mr\. Zhao a protege of Deng Xiaoping the de facto head of the party as well as the government 
46hc0303 It is a delicate position requiring him to maneuver among various interest groups and personal cliques that make up China\'s top leadership 
46hc0304 PaineWebber itself hasn\'t been charged with wrongdoing 
46hc0305 The firm a unit of PaineWebber Group Incorporated released a short term statement yesterday in which it said the two men have been suspended indefinitely 
46hc0306 The firm has cooperated with the U\. S\. Attorney\'s office throughout the investigation and will continue to do so 
46hc0307 Then there are utility stocks 
46hc0308 The Nasdaq Utility Index jumped eighteen \%PERCENT in the first quarter while indexes of listed utility stocks rose barely three \%PERCENT 
46hc0309 But in fact most of the fifty five electric gas and water utility stocks on Nasdaq performed much like their counterparts on the major exchanges 
46hc030a Producers however say the guild demand really represents an effort to squeeze in more than one session a day 
46hc030b The actors are paid by the session not by the hour and both sides agree that sessions rarely exceed three hours 
46hc030c And with the guild choosing such a critical time for the strike T\. V\. production officials are especially irate 
46hc030d When my family fled we left my nanny in charge of the house 
46hc030e [tongue_click] But soon a lieutenant in the revolutionary army evicted her and installed his mistress 
46hc030f Later the house went to the North Koreans 
46hc030g F\. D\. A\. researchers say they don\'t know much yet about the long term effects of fat substitutes mixing with medication and other substances 
46hc030h Typically lab tests on food products are for the life cycle of rats or mice about four years 
46hc030i Researchers say they aren\'t sure such tests parallel human consumption of fat over longer periods 
46hc030j We just don\'t know says the F\. D\. A\.\'s Mr\. Mertz 
46hc030k With every new development there are risks 
46hc030l Announcement of the talks surprised analysts and failed to impress investors 
46hc030m British Aerospace shares fell twenty five pence forty four cents to three hundred and twenty nine pence in late trading yesterday on London\'s stock exchange 
46hc030n The handful of Rover shares trading jumped nineteen pence to eighty six pence after the announcement but fell back to eighty two pence

46hc030p Mr\. Young\'s contract which ran until January twenty fourth nineteen ninety one called for a salary of at least four hundred and ten thousand dollars a year 
46hc030q In nineteen eighty six Mr\. Young was paid five hundred and fifty thousand five hundred and ninety six dollars 
46hc030r As a recent visit revealed the soup kitchen has become a powerful magnet drawing hundreds who come for more than just daily nourishment 
46hc030s Mr\. Kovacs an octogenarian who croons love ballads to anyone who will listen comes for camaraderie 
46hc030t For George a middle aged retarded man the kitchen is a lifeline 
46hc030u He arrived five years ago picked up a broom and without saying a word started cleaning up he now gets paid the minimum wage 
46hc030v The offer is a brilliant defense contrived by Santa Fe\'s investment bankers at Salomon Brothers and Goldman Sachs 
46hc030w The sixty three dollars a share price will hang over the negotiations like smog over Los Angeles 
46hc030x And though Mr\. Dingman will offer package after package that seems to add up to sixty three dollars he doesn\'t really plan to meet the asking price- ~ 
46hc030y Instead he hopes to persuade Santa Fe to take less 
46hc030z For one hundred years Wyoming has been riding a roller coaster 
46hc0310 When commodity prices rise people rush to Wyoming for short term work at boom town pa(y)- ~ 
46hc0311 Government revenues largely underwritten by energy company taxes explode 
46hc0312 When commodity prices sour people pull out often with their mobile homes trailing behind 
46hc0313 And revenues slump 
46hc0314 The reason for the relatively modest incentive programs is that the auto makers are demonstrating a much better ability to keep production in line with sales 
46hc0315 [tongue_click] [loud_breath] Inventories of U\. S\. made cars stood at fifty nine days supply at the end of August according to Ward\'s Automotive Reports an industry trade publication 
46hc0316 That is considered a normal supply and it is the lowest stock in twenty two months 
46hc0317 Takeover talk aroused interest in two financial corners 
46hc0318 Mercantile Bancorp soared five and a half to thirty and three quarters on renewed buy out speculation 
46hc0319 Sun State Savings and Loan ended at eight and a quarter up two after confirming that it received an unsolicited acquisition proposal from an investment group 
46hc031a In Houston a Coastal spokesman said the fight isn\'t over 
46hc031b We anticipate asking for a rehearing or appealing to the Supreme Court the spokesman said 
46hc031c He added We were quite surprised by the reversal 
46hc031d We thought we had a solid case 
46hc0401 I\'ve been trying to live my life by an idea she says pointing to a video game 
46hc0402 See that machine 
46hc0403 That\'s an idea 
46hc0404 Rock and roll 
46hc0405 That\'s an idea 
46hc0406 In heavy trading Friday profit taking caused the Nikkei average to slip seventy \.POINT one eight to twenty one thousand one hundred and five \.POINT eight five 
46hc0407 The decline snapped a string of five record closings 
46hc0408 The stock exchange index fell twelve \.POINT nine two points to eighteen sixteen \.POINT six nine 
46hc0409 Volume totaled about one billion shares 
46hc040a Mr\. Abboud also gained a reputation during the First Chicago years as being abrasive and sometimes harsh with subordinates and that tag has lingered 
46hc040b I\'ve never seen an adjective used so much in connection with a person\'s name he said in a nineteen eighty four interview 
46hc040c People think the A\. in A\. Robert Abboud stands for abrasive 
46hc040d In Amsterdam stocks closed lower in volatile trading 
46hc040e Selected issues ended off their intraday lows though after Wall Street\'s lower opening proved less severe than some Dutch forecasters anticipated dealers said 
46hc040f Volatile trading throughout the session produced wide price fluctuations [loud_breath] as Dutch institutions bargain hunted while overseas investors tended to sell shares 
46hc040g Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value 
46hc040h Thus higher bidding narrows the investor\'s return while lower bidding widens it 
46hc040i The percentage rates are calculated on a three hundred and sixty day year while the coupon equivalent yield is based on a three hundred and sixty five day year 
46hc040j Technically the stopgap bill will leave the government out of money over the weekend 
46hc040k But that should have little practical effect since most operations will be closed during that time 
46hc040l Congressional leaders hope however it will pressure lawmakers to finish their work before Monday 
46hc040m Some months before the crash interest rates started to move up 
46hc040n Home mortgage rates went up almost ten times as fast as they came down 
46hc040o The money supply growth was muddling at or below the lower end of the target range a phenomenon we have not experienced for many years 
46hc040p For a ship or missile guided by the wrong time signal that little gap could mean arriving at the wrong destination 
46hc040q If we let the difference grow says Mr\. McCarthy we could run into problems over thousands of years 
46hc040r It might be noon by atomic time but dark outside 
46hc040s This heady mixture of piety and gutter fighting we fear is likely to detract from causes we would like to advance 
46hc040t This is perfectly illustrated by Mr\. Robertson\'s charge that there are Russian intermediate range missiles in Cuba 
46hc040u It is perfectly true that the I\. N\. F\. treaty gives us no rights to inspect for missiles in the Soviet\'s island satellite 
46hc040v And it is true that Soviet bases there are a danger to the U\. S\. 
46hc040w But to pose these valid issues in the most inflammatory way Mr\. Robertson has charged that the missiles are already deployed and in place 
46hc040x If this is presented as the issue the answer is no and the valid points are lost 
46hc040y Kaiser\'s present value is equally uncertain the company estimates that its net worth is at least a negative five hundred million 
46hc040z In its lawsuits against former management the company is seeking damages of more than three hundred million for alleged self dealing and mismanagement 
46hc0410 In the process the suits allege assets were overstated and liabilities understated 
46hc0411 The shortage of Western capacity makes Soviet launchers attractive 
46hc0412 [loud_breath] A series of launch disasters including the Challenger explosion severely curtailed Western access to space in nineteen eighty six to eighty seven 
46hc0413 The European Ariane launcher just returned to commercial service 
46hc0414 The U\. S\. space program will not eliminate its backlog of payloads until the early nineteen nineties 
46hc0415 You think that\'s weird 
46hc0416 Think again 
46hc0417 He\'s not alone 
46hc0418 Carbide\'s sabotage theory is weakened partly because it hasn\'t disclosed all its evidence 
46hc0419 [loud_breath] Though its attorneys say they have interviewed the alleged saboteur extensively they won\'t disclose his name or whereabouts or describe him 
46hc041a They also decline to say whether they understand his motives or have any witnesses 
46hc041b The one element of suspense remains the selection of a running mate for Vice President Bush\'s presidential campaign 
46hc041c Bush managers insist they won\'t disclose the vice presidential nominee\'s identity until Thursday morning 
46hc041d [loud_breath] Reagan arrived at the convention site last night and prepared for his farewell speech to the party tonight 
46hc041e Th- The president leaves for California tomorrow and Bush will arrive to take control of the convention 
46hc041f It is a crucial time in which Bush must attempt to move out from under Reagan\'s shadow and establish his own identity 
46ic0201 Phil Walters whose back yard would have faced the proposed shelter says he went to meetings to learn both sides of the shelter debate 
46ic0202 But just for wanting to hear the pros and cons I became a pro derelict revolutionary in the eyes of some people he recalls 
46ic0203 They didn\'t want an objective study 
46ic0204 They just wanted to prevent the onslaught of the bums 
46ic0205 [tongue_click] France Fund Inc\. had a net asset value of fourteen dollars and forty six cents and a closing price of ten and one eighth as of Thursday 
46ic0206 Gabelli Equity Trust Inc\. had a net asset value of nine dollars thirty six cents and a closing price of eight and seven eighths as of Friday

46ic0208 Bancroft Convertible Fund Inc\. had a net asset value of twenty five dollars eighty eight cents and a closing price of twenty seven and a fourth as of Friday 
46ic0209 [misc_noise] In nineteen eighty some government employees C\. I\. A\. had to give up First Amendment rights 
46ic020a [tongue_click] Now it is suggested that officials give up Fifth Amendment rights 
46ic020b In nineteen ninety someone is going to suggest that government officials give up their Fourth Amendment rights protecting them from unlawful searches 
46ic020c Why not 
46ic020d They may be hiding important documents in their homes 
46ic020e [tongue_click] Cable operators are willing participants in the price cutting programs 
46ic020f For one thing because of deregulation which took effect January first [loud_breath] the operators have been allowed to raise rates for basic cable service 
46ic020g In addition the pay networks are cutting the prices they charge operators 
46ic020h Congress gave the space agency\'s plan mixed reviews 
46ic020i [tongue_click] Rep\. Bill Lowery . Republican California who has been outspoken about the importance of securing a second booster rocket supplier praised the plan 
46ic020j Competition fuels excellence he said and this is the first step toward a solid rocket motor with better safety precautions and more efficient production 
46ic020k [tongue_click] Energy experts consider Amoco and Exxon among the industry\'s healthiest companies financially with strong credit ratings and low debt 
46ic020l [tongue_click] Amoco\'s financial statements show it had four hundred forty one million in cash and marketable securities on hand at the close of nineteen eighty six 
46ic020m [tongue_click] In recent talks with analysts Amoco officials have said the company is well positioned financially [loud_breath] if it decides to make an acquisition 
46ic020n Moreover a Western firm has to make some calculation of whether Mr\. Gorbachev [loud_breath] will succeed in his efforts to activate the Soviet work force 
46ic020o Past experience and current reports indicate that his chances aren\'t good 
46ic020p [tongue_click] Rowland Evans and Robert Novak reported [loud_breath] from Moscow last week that party apparatchiks and disaffected Soviet workers already are undermining reforms 
46ic020q [tongue_click] The government faces a knotty surplus problem 
46ic020r U\. S\. storage bins hold roughly an eight month supply of corn and a ten month supply of wheat when a three month supply would do 
46ic020s [tongue_click] Making matters worse the harvest ripening in the fields promises to be a monster portending record post harvest supplies of corn and a glut of other commodities 
46ic020t [tongue_click] To help cut production the U\. S\. is paying farmers an annual rent for ten years to idle erosion prone crop land under a conservation reserve program 
46ic020u Humana tried to defend itself through diversification as did the other large chains Hospital Corp\. of America American Medical International and National Medical Enterprises Inc\. 
46ic020v [tongue_click] The idea was that if a hospital owner also had an insurance plan it could steer patients to its institutions through financial incentives 
46ic020w The patient pool might shrink but the company could grab a bigger part of it 
46ic020x [tongue_click] Kemp\'s campaign takes on an increasingly [misc_noise>] desperate tone 
46ic020y In one sure sign of a candidacy in trouble he lashes out at criticism from a highly regarded T\. V\. commentator 
46ic020z [tongue_click] Even some supporters now say privately that he should aim for the vice presidential nomination 
46ic0210 [beep] But his longtime hostilities with Dole leave a spot on a Bush ticket as about the only possibility 
46ic0211 We never had one before Mr\. Timbers said 
46ic0212 [tongue_click] A certain percentage of our clients would like to have that option 
46ic0213 [tongue_click] It\'s not necessarily a market call 
46ic0214 Mr\. Timbers says he\'s fairly ambivalent about the price of gold near term 
46ic0215 [tongue_click] He does see however higher inflation of five \%PERCENT or so in nineteen eighty nine up from four \%PERCENT this year 
46ic0216 A gold option could be a nice alternative for fixed income investors should inflation fears arise Mr\. Timbers says 
46ic0217 [tongue_click] But he warns that companies should ask how much stock is too much 
46ic0218 [tongue_click] A director holding a large block may become more interested in short term results than long term corporate [misc_noise] health 
46ic0219 That director may also be more tempted to vote his pocketbook in a takeover *fight* says ~ 
46ic021a [tongue_click] As Britain\'s flag carrier the airline inherited a vast route network 
46ic021b [tongue_click] British Caledonian brought routes to the southern U\. S\. the Middle East and Africa as well as lucrative flights to East Asia 
46ic021c [misc_noise] British Airways gave up only a few routes from Gatwick to European cities which in most cases it already served from Heathrow 
46ic021d [tongue_click] Mr\. Baker is also well acquainted with Rudolph Giuliani [loud_breath] the U\. S\. attorney for Manhattan who is overseeing that office\'s investigation of Drexel 
46ic021e As White House chief of staff Mr\. Baker offered Mr\. Giuliani the chairmanship of the S\. E\. C\. in nineteen eighty seven 
46ic021f Mr\. Giuliani declined the post which was later accepted by David S\. Ruder 
46ic0301 [tongue_click] [loud_breath] All the gains that we\'re making are at the local level says F\. James McDonald G\. M\.\'s president 
46ic0302 That may be the most important thing happening in heavy industry in the U\. S\. today 
46ic0303 Indeed the era of big time national labor talks in which union and management leaders butt heads over pennies an hour is waning 
46ic0304 [tongue_click] Also selling well was a fifty million dollar issue of revenue bonds by the Florida Department of Natural Resources 
46ic0305 The unsold balance was about ten \.POINT three million 
46ic0306 The bonds were priced after auction to yield from four \.POINT two oh \%PERCENT in nineteen eighty eight [loud_breath] to seven \.POINT two oh \%PERCENT in two thousand twelve

46ic030f Despite my best efforts I remain a reporter seated on a chair in a bookstore 
46ic030g Mr\. Zinn said Entertainment Marketing is still weighing a proxy fight 
46ic030h It\'s a bad feeling in your stomach when the chairman and previous bidder is selling his block he said 
46ic030i It doesn\'t make me as a shareholder comfortable with what is happening in the company 
46ic030j He also was emphatic about keeping Burger King 
46ic030k [tongue_click] I want to say without qualification that Burger King is central to Pillsbury 
46ic030l [tongue_click] It was true yesterday it is true today and it remains true f- for the company\'s strategic future he said 
46ic030m [tongue_click] Some issuers also are wary of doing away with outside counsel [loud_breath] 
46ic030n In Washington state a proposal to use the attorney general as counsel on all state bond issues came before a legislative committee last year 
46ic030o [tongue_click] Its adoption would have saved Washington more than two hundred thousand dollars a year 
46ic030p Strong opposition from the attorney general\'s office defeated the proposal however 
46ic030q [tongue_click] Mr\. Moreland couldn\'t be reached for comment but attorneys representing him have previously denied he committed any acts of fraud 
46ic030r [tongue_click] An attorney for Mr\. Reynolds in San Diego said we feel our client did nothing in violation of the securities laws 
46ic030s Joseph A\. Johnson a geologist allegedly hired by Mr\. Moreland who is also named as a defendant in the suit said he hadn\'t yet been served 
46ic030t [tongue_click] Grains and soybeans The threat of rain and favorable spring planting conditions pushed soybean and corn futures prices lower 
46ic030u [tongue_click] The latest weather forecast calls for fairly good moisture in Midwest farming states over the next six to ten days 
46ic030v Analysts said traders are shifting their emphasis away from last year\'s crop and to this year\'s 
46ic030w With this year\'s small acreage increases weather and spring planting conditions are major concerns [loud_breath] to a market that is beginning to shake off a huge surplus 
46ic030x The favorable conditions helped the soybean contract for November settlement close at six \.POINT eight two two five dollars a bushel down nine \.POINT five cents 
46ic030y Further signs of strong U\. S\. economic growth are expected to emerge from a Labor Department re- report next Friday on the nation\'s employment picture for August 
46ic030z [tongue_click] If so Federal Reserve officials may raise short term interest rates further within a few weeks several analysts said 
46ic0310 They also predicted that banks will raise their prime or base rates again to ten and a half \%PERCENT or eleven \%PERCENT from the current ten \%PERCENT level 
46ic0311 [tongue_click] The study was part of Cornell\'s response to calls by local politicians that it should help more in Tompkins County 
46ic0312 [misc_noise] When the schools were ranked by operating budget or value of buildings Cornell\'s one \.POINT two million dollar payments were found to be near the bottom of the list 
46ic0313 [tongue_click] In per student payments Cornell ranked seventh [loud_breath] at seventy dollars

46ic0315 Economic cooperation was advanced [<misc_noise] with [misc_noise>] businessmen [misc_noise>] signing agreements for about thirty contracts and several joint venture(s)- ~ 
46ic0316 Human rights too may have taken a step forward if Mr\. Gorbachev lives up to his promise to release all political prisoners by year\'s end 
46ic0317 [tongue_click] B\. P\. could spend up to ten billion on a U\. S\. takeover Mr\. Lazier says by financing it with a blend of debt and equity 
46ic0318 [tongue_click] Los Angeles based Unocal Corp\. with extensive refining and marketing activities on the West Coast long has been seen as a possible acquisition target 
46ic0319 [tongue_click] Buying Unocal also could give B\. P\. a needed boost in its natural gas reserves 
46ic031a [lip_smack] Other [misc_noise>] takeover possibilities include Phillips Petroleum Company of Bartlesville Oklahoma [loud_breath] and New York based Amerada Hess Corp\. 
46ic031b [tongue_click] As a result it can make sales in keeping with market conditions without having a significant effect on its economy Mr\. Nichols said 
46ic031c Last year it\'s estimated the Soviet Union made between two hundred and twenty million and two hundred and thirty million from sales of palladium 
46ic031d It made billions on gold 
46ic0401 The department also said that productivity for nonfinancial companies increased at a zero \.POINT three \%PERCENT annual rate in the third quarter a preliminary estimate 
46ic0402 The estimate is based on an increase in output of one \.POINT four \%PERCENT and an increase in hours worked of one \.POINT one \%PERCENT 
46ic0403 This was the first quarter in which productivity increased in the nonfinancial sector since the third quarter of nineteen eighty five 
46ic0404 In recent years however insider trading cases have sometimes involved people who are quite remote from companies that are the subject of inside information 
46ic0405 [loud_breath] Since nineteen eighty the Supreme Court has suggested without being specific that such cases might involve misappropriation or illegal use of information 
46ic0406 A decision in the Winans case may help define securities fraud by misappropriation 
46ic0407 These teens crave excitement 
46ic0408 They spurn rest and recreation 
46ic0409 They dream about power and pots of money 
46ic040a Especially money 
46ic040b Last month Piedmont\'s board recommended that the company accept Norfolk Southern\'s bid to acquire the company for sixty five dollars a share 
46ic040c Norfolk Southern has had a stake in Piedmont since nineteen eighty one 
46ic040d But one day after the board\'s recommendation U\. S\. Air sweetened its initial bid for Piedmont [loud_breath] forcing the board to drop its recommendation 
46ic040e Inco\'s stock has caught technical analysts\' attention too 
46ic040f It recently broke out of a five year trading range says Martin Pring editor of Pring Market Review 
46ic040g He thinks the stock could be poised for big gains reflecting what may be a bull market in base metals 
46ic040h [tongue_click] Was that the earth shifting in Mike Kinsley\'s Viewpoint column yesterday on the page opposite A Democrats\' Guide to Robert Bork 
46ic040i Mr\. Kinsley called the Roe versus 
46ic040j [tongue_click] Wade abortion decision one of the judicial excesses of activist judges 
46ic040k When we found ourselves described as the center of conservative intellectual hypocrisy on judicial restraint 
46ic040l We believe we\'re coming to understand the meaning of neoliberal an ex liberal who attacks conservatives in the process of adopting their positions 
46ic040m The finding uniformly surprised longtime researchers in the field 
46ic040n There is a scientific rationale behind T\. H\. A\. says Doctor Leon Thal a researcher at San Diego Veterans Administration Hospital 
46ic040o But the results were s- overwhelming and when you get results like that out of the blue the first reaction is to be skeptical 
46ic040p The test was less than a complete success 
46ic040q [tongue_click] Dirt that accumulated in the kenaf during harvesting wasn\'t all removed and ended up in the paper 
46ic040r The kenaf also jammed in some equipment because it had been cut in lengths that were several feet long 
46ic040s Representative Foley said there was general agreement that a deficit reduction package should consist half of spending cuts and half revenue raising measures 
46ic040t But negotiators still couldn\'t agree on what constitutes revenue raisers or spending cuts 
46ic040u [tongue_click] House Republican Leader Robert Michel of Illinois complained I\'m just asking the Democrats to give us real savings- ~ 
46ic040v Most Arab states broke off relations with Egypt when that country signed a peace treaty with Israel eight years ago

46ic0410 The bank holding company slated another fifty million sale next Tuesday 
46ic0411 [tongue_click] Dukakis defeated Jackson by a three to two margin in Saturday\'s Arizona presidential caucuses 
46ic0412 The Massachusetts governor won twenty two delegates to the Democratic National Convention in July

46ic0414 [tongue_click] All three candidates continued campaigning in New York for tomorrow\'s primary election 
46ic0415 Even after finding a buyer completing a foreclosure sale is hardly routine 
46ic0416 Brokers at Merrill Lynch Realty recall a sale that was delayed for a month by a one million dollar Internal Revenue Service lien on the property 
46ic0417 Another sale was delayed when the lender discovered that the owner had died between the time the property was posted for foreclosure and the foreclosure was completed 
46ic0418 We were at the closing table when this all came out says Wanda Hutchins the Merrill Lynch agent 
46ic0419 Invalid foreclosures are one of the biggest problems we have 
46ic041a [tongue_click] The lower volatility could be especially important right now when the course of interest rates seems especially cloudy 
46ic041b [tongue_click] While interest rates have been declining recently many economists expect rates to rise by year end 
46ic041c After that however they say rates could fall again perhaps sharply as economic growth slows in nineteen eighty nine 
46ic041d The most widely used estrogen product in the U\. S\. is sold under the brand name Premarin by American Home Products Corp\.\'s Wyeth Ayerst Laboratories 
46ic041e [tongue_click] In nineteen eighty eight sales of Premarin largely to prevent osteoporosis jumped twenty six \%PERCENT to two hundred thirty six million 
46ic041f A spokeswoman for the company said Premarin isn\'t currently indicated for use in preventing heart disease but the company is researching the matter 
46jc0201 [tongue_click] The accord most *likely* would include some private agreement among ministers on how far up or down these rates can move and still be acceptable

46jc0203 [cross_talk/] And it isn\'t known yet whether the major powers would pledge to intervene in currency markets if exchange rates were to exceed those limits [/cross_talk] 
46jc0204 How is Wall Street reacting to the changes 
46jc0205 Some investment bankers feel threatened by it others scoff at suggestion that these efforts are truly competitive 
46jc0206 But some say the case isn\'t clear 
46jc0207 [lip_smack] Few developers are big enough to justify the cost of these divisions 
46jc0208 [lip_smack] The test will be whether the new units are [<door_slam] adding value to their organizations

46jc020a [lip_smack] In Cleveland Higbee chief executive officer Robert Broadbent says the retailer has benefited from its parent\'s financial expertise 
46jc020b [tongue_click] Although it will retain control Industrial Equity is planning to take Higbee public again probably in June

46jc020d [lip_smack] Despite worries about investment bankers lending money for buyouts Morgan Stanley did better than Owens Illinois\' public bondholders will do 
46jc020e [lip_smack] Annualized it earned eighty \%PERCENT pre tax on its three month three hundred million dollar [loud_breath] loan to Owens Illinois Mr\. Niehaus says 
46jc020f That includes interest of ten million dollars and investment banking fees of fifty million dollars 
46jc020g [lip_smack] Thirteen years ago Mr\. Smith was mired in personal bankruptcy proceedings 
46jc020h [tongue_click] Now he lives like a successful corporate executive 
46jc020i But there is a difference 
46jc020j His is a tax exempt not for profit corporation dedicated to helping minors the sick and the needy 
46jc020k [lip_smack] It also has greatly helped the Smith family 
46jc020l Last year the corporation paid the Smiths and a son in law more than three hundred forty eight thousand dollars in salaries and bonuses 
46jc020m [tongue_click] Mr\. Smith also had an outstanding unsecured personal loan of one hundred twelve thousand dollars and enjoyed other perquisites

46jc020o [tongue_click] U\. S\. utilities also could increase orders of foreign uranium ahead of any total import restrictions analysts say [loud_breath] 
46jc020p Uranium from South Africa for example has already fallen under anti apartheid sanctions 
46jc020q [tongue_click] But last year said the Uranium Institute U\. S\. imports of South African uranium surged three hundred \%PERCENT to more than thirteen \.POINT two million pounds

46jc020s [lip_smack] Rorer Group whose stock eased three eighths to thirty five and three quarters [loud_breath] said it signed a definitive agreement to acquire A\. H\. Robins 
46jc020t [lip_smack] The agreement is a key part of Robins\'s bankruptcy reorganization plan 
46jc020u [lip_smack] Robins jumped one and one half to twenty one 
46jc020v [lip_smack] Some critics see the growth control movement as the indulgence of a self satisfied middle class 
46jc020w [lip_smack] And some charge that there are racist roots 
46jc020x [lip_smack] The fact is that a lot of people don\'t like seeing Hispanics and Asians around says Daniel Garcia the president of the Los Angeles Planning Commission

46jc020z Up ahead he s- spots a roadblock where a white policeman with a dog is holding up three blacks traveling on a donkey pulled wagon [misc_noise] 
46jc0210 Mr\. Kgori decides to go straight on the dirt road even though it will take him an hour out of his way 
46jc0211 [lip_smack] That was illustrated by a temporary surge in securities lending during last October\'s crash and a previous securities settlements backlog in Britain 
46jc0212 [tongue_click] Said one U\. K\. monetary official Clearly there was demand in the market for more equities money broking 
46jc0213 [lip_smack] What you are seeing with Shearson\'s move is a reflection of that demand 
46jc0214 [tongue_click] Some banking analysts doubt a London or Tokyo bank would make a similar acquisition anytime here soon 
46jc0215 Among other things some foreign banks have been shying away from acquiring assets in the U\. S\. [loud_breath] because of unexpectedly high expenses managing them from afar 
46jc0216 Instead the trend among foreign banks is to increasingly build alliances with U\. S\. banks

46jc021d [lip_smack] The suits seek damages of the difference between the offering price and the market price when the suits were filed 
46jc021e [tongue_click] To the extent that export growth continues it will keep the U\. S\. economy from slipping added Mr\. Witten 
46jc021f [lip_smack] So you can have a soft landing scenario based on expanding exports 
46jc021g [tongue_click] A soft landing combines moderate economic growth with low inflation 
46jc0301 [door_slam] [tongue_click] [door_slam] Prices moved up in response to news that U\. S\. durable goods orders declined seven and a half \%PERCENT in January 
46jc0302 Prices also slid after the release of the Tower Commission report on the Reagan administration\'s involvement in the Iran Contra affair 
46jc0303 But by late in the session issues had firmed again 
46jc0304 [lip_smack] Mr\. Epstein said he set some very short range goals to help Penril get back into the black 
46jc0305 [tongue_click] His plans include restructuring some debt and selling one of the company\'s five divisions to generate enough capital to finance the growth of the other four 
46jc0306 [lip_smack] He declined to identify the division that will be sold 
46jc0307 [lip_smack] The look and feel cases are generating controversy in the industry 
46jc0308 Companies bringing the suits say they are defending the rewards due those who develop innovative software from companies that are selling cut rate copies 
46jc0309 [lip_smack] But others argue that new software always borrows from the old 
46jc030a [lip_smack] They say Lotus if its suit succeeds will stifle innovation and discourage the spread of standards that help computer users master software made by different companies 
46jc030b [tongue_click] Congress gave the space agency\'s plan mixed reviews 
46jc030c [tongue_click] [cross_talk/] Representative Bill Lowery Republican California [/cross_talk] [loud_breath] who has been outspoken about the importance of securing a second booster rocket supplier praised the plan

46jc030i [lip_smack] Moreover Mr\. Vitale says it\'s worth a premium to get a foothold in the U\. S\. market 
46jc030j If you are in publishing the only market with large numbers is the English speaking market [misc_noise] he says 
46jc030k [lip_smack] Political observers theorize that the political rehabilitation is linked to this invisible presidential race 
46jc030l Some say for instance that Mr\. de la Madrid [loud_breath] put the former minister on display to goad other candidates into working harder 
46jc030m [lip_smack] Others suggest that [<door_slam] one presidential hopeful is using the popular Mr\. Silva Herzog to undermine his rivals 
46jc030n [lip_smack] The most provocative hypothesis has it that Mr\. Silva Herzog has himself become a candidate again [door_slam] 
46jc030o [lip_smack] We are aware of our international obligations and we willingly accept them the banker observes 
46jc030p [lip_smack] But the Bundesbank [loud_breath] he asserts has to be very cautious in setting its monetary policy 
46jc030q [tongue_click] From our point of view we already have a permissive policy he says 
46jc030r [tongue_click] Mr\. Wright didn\'t list those earnings on nineteen eighty seven personal financial disclosure forms 
46jc030s [tongue_click] Attorney Daniel Swillinger . said [loud_breath] at a minimum he should have disclosed this the six thousand five hundred dollar escrow [loud_breath] as an asset 
46jc030t [tongue_click] Mr\. Swillinger counseled Representative Newt Gingrich [loud_breath] Republican Georgia [<door_slam] on the drafting of a complaint against Mr\. Wright that helped touch off the ethics investigation 
46jc030u The one element of suspense remains the selection of a running mate for Vice President Bush\'s presidential campaign 
46jc030v [lip_smack] Bush managers insist they won\'t disclose the vice presidential nominee\'s identity until Thursday morning 
46jc030w [tongue_click] Reagan arrived at the convention site last night and prepared for his farewell speech to the party tonight 
46jc030x The president leaves for California tomorrow and Bush will arrive to take control of the convention 
46jc030y [lip_smack] It is a crucial time in which Bush must attempt to move out from under Reagan\'s shadow and establish his own identity 
46jc030z [tongue_click] The decision to interrupt the Olympic coverage could mean a potential advertising revenue loss of eight million dollars according to Michael Gartner president of N\. B\. C\. News 
46jc0310 [lip_smack] The debates wouldn\'t be interrupted by ads 
46jc0311 [lip_smack] After some second guessing on their earlier decision to skip the presidential debate Mr\. Gartner said network officials changed their minds yesterday 
46jc0312 Eight million bucks isn\'t something you want to kiss away but you swallow hard and do what you think is right Mr\. Gartner said 
46jc0313 [tongue_click] A federal jury in Los Angeles convicted a former Mexican police officer of the nineteen eighty five kidnap and murder of a U\. S\. drug agent and a pilot 
46jc0314 [misc_noise] Raul Lopez Alvarez twenty nine was the first of three alleged members of a Mexican drug ring to be convicted in the case

46jc031b [lip_smack] If you have an Arabian horse he is your friend 
46jc031c [tongue_click] When the House and Senate approved the tax bill early Saturday lawmakers didn\'t mention the last minute provisions and congressional staffers described them as technical 
46jc031d [tongue_click] While the estimated revenue of almost one hundred million dollars over three years is relatively small the provisions might be perceived as an anti takeover push by Congress 
46jc031e [tongue_click] They could have the effect of slowing certain takeover activity congressional sources acknowledged over the weekend 
46jc031f [lip_smack] To be sure on a lot of scores the summit was a success 
46jc031g Economic cooperation was advanced with businessmen signing agreements for about thirty contracts and several joint ventures 
46jc031h [lip_smack] Human rights too may have taken a step forward if Mr\. Gorbachev [loud_breath] lives up to his promise to release all political prisoners by year\'s end 
46jc0401 [tongue_click] Lafarge also named Robert W\. Murdoch forty four president and chief operating officer 
46jc0402 [lip_smack] Mr\. Francois previously held the post of president the post of chief operating officer is new 
46jc0403 Mr\. Murdoch had been president of Canada Cement Lafarge Lafarge Corporation\'s Canadian unit [door_slam] 
46jc0404 [tongue_click] The Nasdaq O\. T\. C\. composite index rose two \.POINT two six to four hundred twenty nine 
46jc0405 In the O\. T\. C\. market there were one thousand two hundred ninety three issues advancing and nine hundred eighty nine declining 
46jc0406 Volume rose to one hundred seventy \.POINT four million shares from one hundred fifty five \.POINT seven million Wednesday 
46jc0407 [tongue_click] The American Stock Exchange Market Value index rose three \.POINT one seven to three hundred twenty nine \.POINT forty seven 
46jc0408 [lip_smack] Both the Nasdaq and Amex indexes surpassed records set Wednesday 
46jc0409 U\. S\. bank regulations are another stumbling block 
46jc040a [lip_smack] Currently banks can\'t own more than nineteen \.POINT nine \%PERCENT of a non financial company and can only be passive investors 
46jc040b [lip_smack] Unless these restrictions are dropped banks are likely to be swapping mainly for equity in financial institutions 
46jc040c Those aren\'t always appealing or even available 
46jc040d Mexico nationalized its banks five years ago 
46jc040e [lip_smack] And in Brazil central bank figures show that one out of every seven bank loans is past due [loud_breath] eight times the delinquency rate of a year earlier 
46jc040f [tongue_click] The stock split will be distributed on or about July second to holders of record on June twenty sixth 
46jc040g After the dividend the company will have about seven \.POINT eight million shares outstanding 
46jc040h The company said it will discontinue paying the previous regular quarterly cash dividend of fifteen cents a share after the stock dividend is paid to conserve cash for future acquisitions 
46jc040i The cash dividend last was paid May fifteenth 
46jc040j [tongue_click] With less regulatory and political pressure Conrail was able to abandon about five thousand miles of track between nineteen eighty one and nineteen eighty six 
46jc040k [tongue_click] About half of that has been taken up by short line railroads nonunion railroads that have continued to provide the service at a lesser cost

46jc040m Burmah a British oil company and S\. H\. V\. a Dutch energy concern said they would proceed with their offer only if Calor endorsed the bid 
46jc040n [tongue_click] A spokesman for Burmah said that the proposal made yesterday was final and that Burmah and S\. H\. V\. wouldn\'t contemplate a hostile offer 
46jc040o He also ruled out the possibility that Burmah might launch a bid on its own 
46jc040p Ivan Toms isn\'t in a festive mood as he contemplates his impending confrontation with the military 
46jc040q [lip_smack] I know it will be horrific he says staring down at his lunch but it is important to take this stand 
46jc040r [lip_smack] I think individuals can make a difference 
46jc040s [lip_smack] The budget however will not manage itself 
46jc040t Some way must be found to put it on course 
46jc040u In our history an impasse over policy has been broken occasionally by some sort of national commission [loud_breath] and it is time for one again 
46jc040v [tongue_click] Such a commission resolved the Social Security problem earlier in this decade 
46jc040w [lip_smack] In the Johnson years a commission\'s proposals were the means for restructuring the budget 
46jc040x [lip_smack] Still earlier it was a commission that recommended the creation of the Federal Reserve System 
46jc040y [tongue_click] This approach enables the president and members of Congress to avoid some flak by merely implementing what the commission told us to do 
46jc040z [lip_smack] Thus the board said it would be reluctant to give Bank of New York more than one extension of the i- initial ninety days to consummate the merger 
46jc0410 [lip_smack] Normally extensions of the ninety day rule are granted freely 
46jc0411 [tongue_click] But in the pending merger the board wants to avoid a long and fruitless struggle said Michael Bradfield the Fed\'s general counsel 
46jc0412 [tongue_click] One of the more direct readings on inflation will come in Friday\'s report on consumer prices which are expected not surprisingly to be higher 
46jc0413 [tongue_click] Analysts expect an increase of about four tenths \%PERCENT in the April consumer price index on the heels of a half a \%PERCENT jump the previous month 
46jc0414 [tongue_click] The price increases are expected pretty much across the board as commodities and services are rising at about a four \%PERCENT annual rate 
46jc0415 But there is always the risk that reviving a classic slogan or spokesman will backfire and create an old fashioned image for a brand 
46jc0416 [lip_smack] To guard against that marketers tend to give their recycled ads a contemporary twist 
46jc0417 [lip_smack] The Captain Raid of nineteen eighty eight for example has rippling muscles and a futuristic look 
46jc0418 And a woman in one of the new Nestea spots doesn\'t just tumble into a swimming pool [loud_breath] she falls onto an exercise mat that turns into a pool 
46jc0419 [tongue_click] Prices at the mass retail level however haven\'t risen much in a decade partly because big retailers use tennis balls to lure shoppers 
46jc041a I remember purchasing a can of balls for two dollars in nineteen sixty seven says Walter L\. Henry a Pittsburgh recreational player 
46jc041b [lip_smack] Two weeks ago I picked up a can for a dollar eighty nine 
46jc041c [tongue_click] Reacting to a wave of labor unrest the Communist government announced the special August thirty first session would review economic policies and perhaps adjust national price and income policies 
46jc041d [lip_smack] The interior minister said at least twenty strikes have broken out and authorities extended a curfew and detained forty nine people nationwide 
46jc041e [lip_smack] Some workers ended strikes yesterday but others prepared for assaults by troops and riot police 
46kc0201 [lip_smack] A smaller market share still means substantial growth when the asset pool is vastly expanded notes George Collins president of T\. Rowe Price 
46kc0202 Nonetheless the firm has been paying more attention to the consumer aspects of the business [misc_noise] [sniff] 
46kc0203 [tongue_click] Retail clients currently account for about fifty seven \%PERCENT of the total twenty two billion of assets under management at T\. Rowe Price 
46kc0204 In nineteen seventy eight retail business accounted for about thirty five \%PERCENT of the firm\'s assets 
46kc0205 [tongue_click] Already arbitragers estimate industrywide losses in the takeover stock sell off that followed the b- [loud_breath] Boesky news at between one billion and two billion 
46kc0206 Some say a few of their colleagues lost the entire year\'s profit in the week after the Boesky announcement November fourteenth 
46kc0207 [lip_smack] Others watched glumly as their annual bonuses withered along with prices of takeover stocks 
46kc0208 London\'s one hundred share index fell eight \.POINT six points to close at twenty two seven five its low for the day

46kc020b Volume was four hundred and eighty seven \.POINT six million shares compared with three hundred and ninety four \.POINT seven million Monday 
46kc020c [tongue_click] Frankfurt shares tumbled in response to the weaker dollar and the decline on Wall Street Wednesday brokers said 
46kc020d Many blue chip issues lost as much as two \%PERCENT with a few dropping as much as four \%PERCENT 
46kc020e Financial shares were hit hardest amid fears of higher interest rates 
46kc020f Inevitably some will seek a fourth alternative to continue borrowing from the rest of the world making only marginal adjustments in our economic policies 
46kc020g [tongue_click] Earlier this century the British taught us that debt and leadership cannot long co exist 
46kc020h Eventually and the markets seem to be saying sooner rather than later we will have to choose 
46kc020i We saw it with oil and we\'re seeing it with gold says John Dessauer an Orleans Mass\. money manager 
46kc020j [tongue_click] When the price gets high enough all these new reserves open up eventually knocking down prices he says

46kc0301 [tongue_click] Like their economies the currencies of the U\. S\. and Canada are closely related 
46kc0302 But as interest rates rise in Canada the Canadian dollar is gaining on its U\. S\. counterpart traders and analysts say 
46kc0303 And as the Canadian unit rises it lures more foreign investment particularly from Japan which adds to its strength

46mc0301 [tongue_click] Sources close to Goldman Sachs said that federal marshals had roped off the firm\'s takeover trading area and were carting off documents yesterday afternoon 
46mc0302 [loud_breath] They added that Mr\. Freeman hadn\'t been subpoenaed and that the firm hadn\'t had any warning that any government action was imminent 
46mc0303 Everyone is in total shock said one employee 
46mc0304 [loud_breath] But while nickel and especially copper quotes have since rebounded aluminum prices have continued to tumble 
46mc0305 It seems to be in people\'s interest to keep the price down right now says one London exchange trader 
46mc0306 This will ultimately give them more buying opportunities down the line 
46mc0307 [loud_breath] The nineteen seventy two A\. B\. M\. treaty requires a review every five years 
46mc0308 [loud_breath] Communiques announcing completion of the first and second reviews were issued on November fourth nineteen seventy seven [loud_breath] and November ninth nineteen eighty two 
46mc0309 The third review was due by October third nineteen eighty seven 
46mc030a [tongue_click] The most optimistic estimates are now that it will start sometime after the first of the year 
46mc030b The Reagan administration in short is conspiring with the Soviets to violate the review provisions of the treaty 
46mc030c [loud_breath] No one seems quite sure how the publisher juggles his assets among his various companies which include the publicly owned Maxwell Communication Corporation and various private ones 
46mc030d [loud_breath] [tongue_click] Control of the public company and of private interests like Mirror Group Newspapers L\. T\. D\. [loud_breath] rests with a foundation in Liechtenstein Pergamon Holding Foundation [loud_breath] about which little is disclosed 
46mc030e He says its beneficiaries are charities which he promises to identify someday soon 
46mc030f [loud_breath] [tongue_click] The optimism is widespread 
46mc030g [loud_breath] The association said fifty seven \%PERCENT predicted nineteen eighty eight will be better than nineteen eighty seven while [loud_breath] only thirteen \%PERCENT expected a worse year 
46mc030h That is the highest total to forecast a better future year in December since nineteen eighty three when eighty six \%PERCENT were expecting stronger growth 
46mc030i [loud_breath] President Reagan who was in Durham N\. C\. was cautious about the Soviet offer 
46mc030j [tongue_click] [loud_breath] I\'m waiting to see what the conditions are he said 
46mc030k A senior administration official however called the Gorbachev statement a watershed event [loud_breath] because it will increase expectations among Soviet people for withdrawal 
46mc030l [loud_breath] Regardless of how the foreign purchases begin they often involve the very parts that make weapons perform 
46mc030m [loud_breath] For example F\. M\. C\. Corporation\'s Bradley Fighting Vehicle depends on a sophisticated sensor system from the Netherlands [loud_breath] to inform soldiers of potential threats and targets 
46mc030n Without this part tucked into the turret of the armored vehicle the Bradley would be comparatively helpless on the battlefield 
46mc030o [loud_breath] Mr\. Iacocca said that while the pricing actions increased sales [loud_breath] they also squeezed Chrysler\'s profit margins 
46mc030p [tongue_click] But he added that the Number three U\. S\. auto maker made a conscious decision to sacrifice profit for a higher market share 
46mc030q That move is behind Chrysler\'s recent decisions to increase production [loud_breath] which in turn will boost profit for the rest of the year 
46mc030r [loud_breath] The Cuomo plan doesn\'t stop at gouging New York taxpayers and Long Island ratepayers 
46mc030s Federal taxpayers also will contribute 
46mc030t The key to the deal is that Lilco also would get a two \.POINT five billion tax write off for Shoreham 
46mc030u This would guarantee that the utility won\'t have to pay any federal taxes for at least a decade 
46mc030v [loud_breath] New York also would help Lilco float one hundred million in tax exempt industrial development bonds to help pay for the cleanup 
46mc030w Make that de industrialization bonds 
46mc030x [tongue_click] But network officials will spend months debating C\. B\. S\.\'s wisdom 
46mc030y [loud_breath] It\'s time to be aggressive said Mr\. Pilson testily taking on reporters at yesterday\'s press conference 
46mc030z [loud_breath] I\'m up here stating C\. B\. S\. has acquired the rights and N\. B\. C\. hasn\'t 
46mc0310 [loud_breath] At N\. B\. C\. Mr\. Watson was philosophic if pragmatic [loud_breath] You always want to be a winner he said 
46mc0311 [loud_breath] But you don\'t want to commit suicide at the same time 
46mc0312 [loud_breath] The total cut would correspond to the amount of coffee sold and not exceed eighteen thousand bags 
46mc0313 [loud_breath] One bag equals sixty kilos 
46mc0314 [loud_breath] The annual global export quota is fifty four \.POINT five million bags 
46mc0315 In another trade dispute Kansai International Airport Corporation has come under attack 
46mc0316 Japan insists the company which is in charge of a new airport at Osaka [loud_breath] is private and not subject to ministry orders 
46mc0317 [loud_breath] Foreigners say that is a semantic argument because nearly four fifths of the company\'s executives hail from government ministries 
46mc0318 [loud_breath] Three years ago when the Moslem League came into the shared power arrangement [loud_breath] Mr\. Ijaz Ali got into the provincial assembly 
46mc0319 [loud_breath] There he wrung thousands of rupees from the government to build roads schools and electrification systems in his district 
46mc031a The government\'s idea was to outflank the P\. P\. P\. opposition through public works 
46mc031b [loud_breath] Directly and indirectly the army plays an incalculable role in keeping Pakistan\'s distorted economy perking 
46mc031c [loud_breath] Mr\. Jones the author notes that five hundred thousand Pakistani households [loud_breath] four \%PERCENT of the economically active ones have sent young men into the army 
46mc031d Add in the households involved in services for the military and nearly ten \%PERCENT of the nation\'s households are involved 
46mc031e U\. S\. intelligence about the terrorists is considered poor 
46mc031f It has proven difficult to infiltrate small terrorist cells which often are held together by family relationships 
46mc031g And during the nineteen eighties Lebanese terrorists killed two of the Central Intelligence Agency\'s top Middle East operatives [loud_breath] Robert Ames and William Buckley [loud_breath] 
46mc0401 [tongue_click] As modest as the measures are even they won\'t be adopted without a struggle 
46mc0402 The tax cuts accepted by the coalition parties have been linked to cutbacks in federal subsidies 
46mc0403 Such reductions could rile special interest groups and undermine parliamentary support for the entire tax program 
46mc0404 [loud_breath] Moreover any tax reform must clear parliament\'s upper house the Bundesrat where the ruling Christian Democratic Union clings to a majority 
46mc0405 Some banks have already turned certain debts into securities which so far they have held rather than selling 
46mc0406 [loud_breath] To get around Japanese government limits on debt reserves a group of Japanese banks turned some Third World debt into preferred stock earlier this year 
46mc0407 [loud_breath] And Shearson is about to start marketing a mutual fund to banks that would allow the banks to swap Philippine debt for equity investments in that country 
46mc0408 [loud_breath] The Japanese stock market is awash with liquidity Mr\. Grant says 
46mc0409 But in June suddenly with no apparent drainage it went down and kept going down he says 
46mc040a [loud_breath] What is a mystery to Mr\. Grant and many others is that the Tokyo market has since staged a vigorous rebound 
46mc040b [loud_breath] The Philip Morris magazine enjoys by far the highest circulation of any company magazine seven \.POINT two million copies 
46mc040c [loud_breath] The only requirement is that you have to be an adult to receive the magazine says Mary Taylor associate publisher 
46mc040d [loud_breath] That\'s not because of racy articles but because the tobacco industry has been accused of trying to snatch twelve and thirteen year olds 
46mc040e Philip Morris is even considering selling space to outside advertisers it already ran an ad for Time magazine on a test basis in its winter nineteen eighty seven issue 
46mc040f [loud_breath] Non U\. S\. borrowers also reportedly may come to market 
46mc040g [loud_breath] The Republic of Austria may launch a long dated Euroyen issue [loud_breath] perhaps totaling eighty million yen six hundred and twenty two million dollars 
46mc040h [loud_breath] Japan Finance Corporation for Municipal Enterprises is expected to announce a seven year issue [loud_breath] that may total two hundred million early today 
46mc040i Mitsui and Company has a minority stake in a leveraged buy out fund that acquired control of Joseph Horne Company in late nineteen eighty six 
46mc040j A chart in an earlier edition incorrectly listed Mitsui its role and the date of the transaction 
46mc040k In addition the chart omitted several large recent Japanese acquisitions because of a production error 
46mc040l [loud_breath] The United Nations whose garbage bill is forty two thousand a month is served by National Carting Company which won the pickup rights eight years ago 
46mc040m [tongue_click] [loud_breath] Last December the U\. N\. didn\'t attempt to solicit bids 
46mc040n It simply extended its contract with National Carting 
46mc040o [tongue_click] Soliciting bids in this particular industry is not the way to go a U\. N\. spokesman says implying that it is futile 
46mc040p [tongue_click] A big part of the reason for wood\'s success is the new techniques developed over the past five years for wood panels with a steel core 
46mc040q [tongue_click] Besides narrowing the price difference between wood and metal systems [loud_breath] these techniques provided the precision needed in designing panel systems that must fit together 
46mc040r [loud_breath] Almost all the major office furniture manufacturers have acquired the ability to make wood systems in recent years 
46mc040s [tongue_click] Still there are ways around the no documents dilemma 
46mc040t [loud_breath] Says Davis Dryer a Winthrop Group managing director [loud_breath] My first stop is to go to the factory and say Who is the buff 
46mc040u There\'s always a buff [loud_breath] 
46mc040v [loud_breath] In one case he found an employee who had saved every copy of the company\'s in house magazine for twenty five years 
46mc040w The whole environment has changed he says 
46mc040x [loud_breath] We have a lot more options than we did before 
46mc040y [loud_breath] He\'s planning on spending seven million on advertising and promotion this year compared with a couple of million dollars in the past 
46mc040z [loud_breath] Condom sales for the entire industry were up twenty seven \%PERCENT for the twelve months ended in April 
46mc0410 [loud_breath] Carter Wallace\'s share amounts to over fifty \%PERCENT of the total market 
46mc0411 [misc_noise] One of the four businesses included in the lockup option granted to K\. K\. R\. is Macmillan\'s directory division which consists of Who\'s Who [loud_breath] and National Register Publishing 
46mc0412 [loud_breath] Thus it wasn\'t immediately clear why International Thomson might be looking at the operation even though it is included in the lockup option 
46mc0413 [tongue_click] A spokesman for K\. K\. R\. also declined comment 
46mc0414 Last year after world stock prices crashed the market for domestic Japanese convertible bonds fell briefly 
46mc0415 By the start of this year convertible issues with a par value of more than four trillion yen were trading at below their issue price 
46mc0416 They quickly recovered though thanks to a boom in the stock market and the relatively relaxed rate of new convertible bond issues 
46mc0417 The U\. S\. has been asking Damascus for help but the results have been disappointing 
46mc0418 [loud_breath] We\'re just a little bit exasperated says a senior U\. S\. official 
46mc0419 They aren\'t doing all they could do [loud_breath] 
46mc041a Aviation insurance is under intense pressure 
46mc041b The global airline premiums have dropped to about four hundred million from about one billion in nineteen eighty seven 
46mc041c Meanwhile airline losses in nineteen eighty eight rose significantly from the previous year 
46nc0201 At this point competing developers were eyeing the project 
46nc0202 Under its ground lease with the city and state the partnership might be found in default on its contract enabling a competing developer to take over 
46nc0203 To stave off an attack -t Mr\. Harrison says Our position was that we were never in default on our lease 
46nc0204 We maintain that the bank stopped funding 
46nc0205 [tongue_click] I\'m positive on the move to his new post Mr\. Rhines said 
46nc0206 I grew up in the semiconductor group 
46nc0207 Mr\. Rhines held a number of positions in the company\'s semiconductor operations before taking the data systems job in early nineteen eighty five 
46nc0208 The F\. C\. C\. rejected petitions from several parties maintaining that the stations should be sold to someone with closer ties to the Hispanic community than Hallmark 
46nc0209 Hallmark however has said it would continue these stations in the Spanish language format 
46nc020a [lip_smack] The F\. C\. C\. said the concerns over future programming were irrelevant to the transfer 
46nc020b These are the realities of South Africa says Mr\. de Beer 
46nc020c His eyebrows arch once again 
46nc020d What do we do 
46nc020e [tongue_click] Robert Mc:Clements Junior chairman and chief executive officer said Sun continues to seek an acquisition that will provide the right mix of assets 
46nc020f A spokesman for the company said Sun is looking for something large in the area of energy reserves 
46nc020g The spokesman said that Sun has more than one billion dollars . . in capital that it has gained from spinoffs and divestitures of companies over the past several years 
46nc020h No final budget decisions have been made at the White House 
46nc020i Budget drafting is behind schedule and federal agencies won\'t even see O\. M\. B\. recommendations until late this week 
46nc020j [tongue_click] But it\'s already clear that the administration has increased its emphasis on education 
46nc020k Dole strategists belatedly seem to be recognizing the urgency of the situation 
46nc020l They met yesterday in Washington to review their position 
46nc020m [tongue_click] It surprised people in the campaign just how intense the reaction was to Dole\'s position says one of the senator\'s top campaign advisers 
46nc020n Who got her vote last September

46nc020r [tongue_click] First Interstate\'s f:ourth quarter loss resulted from a previously announced one hundred eighty million addition to its reserves against possible foreign debt losses 
46nc020s But even without the reserves the company said earnings would have been flat at about eighty five million dollars compared with the year earlier quarter 
46nc020t [tongue_click] First Interstate had a slight decline in earnings assets and negligible growth in net interest income 
46nc020u Net interest income fell seventeen \%PERCENT partly because of year earlier results included a nineteen \.POINT six million dollars pretax a gain on the sale of a building 
46nc020v Pillsbury\'s loss compares with earnings of forty eight \.POINT five million dollars or fifty six cents a share in the year earlier quarter 
46nc020w Revenue fell two \%PERCENT in the latest period to one \.POINT fifty billion dollars from one \.POINT fifty three billion dollars 
46nc020x The revenue decline came from Pillsbury\'s restaurant business 
46nc020y That\'s a business decision that the manager has to make Mr\. Keane says 
46nc020z It\'s going to affect his return 
46nc0210 And in the long run the return will decide whether the manager stays in his job 
46nc0211 For hundreds of years the Kurds have struggled to establish an independent Kurdistan in a territory that straddles parts of Turkey Iraq and Iran

46nc0213 [tongue_click] Nearly half live in Turkey which refuses even to recognize them as a distinct national minority and refers to them only as mountain Turks 
46nc0214 Though the Kurds outnumber the Palestinians by a ratio of five to one the Kurdish cause has attracted little global attention

46nc0219 [lip_smack] Thus it wasn\'t immediately clear why International Thomson might be looking at the operation even though it is included in the lockup option 
46nc021a A spokesman for K\. K\. R\. also declined to comment 
46nc021b O\. T\. C\. brokers also stress that their stocks often outperform listed ones on a long term basis 
46nc021c And overall the Nasdaq Comp:osite Index is up thirteen \%PERCENT this year [misc_noise] twice as much as the Dow Jones Industrial Average 
46nc021d [tongue_click] Also they note the tiny stocks that generally trade under three dollars a share [misc_noise] have always taken big percentage moves up or down when they move at all 
46nc021e The most widely used estrogen product in the U\. S\. is sold under the brand name Premarin by American Home Product:s Corp:oration\'s Wyeth Ayerst Laboratories

46nc0306 And Salomon\'s Mr\. Napier says Everyone is getting into cash right now and waiting 
46nc0307 [misc_noise] Hours before the arguments begin lawyers and aides representing outside investors will begin circling

46nc030g Among the big bashes that didn\'t survive was First B:oston Corporation\'s year end extravaganza which in nineteen eighty six entertained three thousand five hundreds 
46nc030h [tongue_click] Rather than fund an encore the brokerage firm contributed to the New York Times Neediest Cases Fund and the Coalition for the Homeless in New York

46nc030k A spokesman for Mr\. Bacot says this A lot has happened in banking and the financial markets in the intervening years 
46nc030l [loud_breath] The relevance of those comments to today\'s circumstances isn\'t very great 
46nc030m [tongue_click] Mr\. Reagan vigorously defended Attorney General Edwin Meese who is under investigation for his role in advancing a Middle East oil pipeline advocated by one of Mr\. Meese\'s friends 
46nc030n Mr\. Reagan said he couldn\'t remember being told anything about the pipeline and expressed every confidence in Mr\. Meese\'s integrity

46nc030p In the two selected areas the state will allow procurement and retail prices to rise to what the open market demands 
46nc030q The subsidy for consumers is meant to reduce the strain on urban residents 
46nc030r [loud_breath] Farmers of course will get higher prices for their grain from the market which in turn should induce them to increase production 
46nc030s Grain production throughout China has faltered in recent years in part because state procurement prices were too low 
46nc030t Meanwhile share prices closed higher in Sydney Hong Kong Wellington Seoul and Manila and were lower in Singapore

46nc030w [tongue_click] Grains and soybeans The threat of rain and favorable spring planting conditions pushed soybean and corn futures prices lower 
46nc030x The latest weather forecast calls for fairly good moisture in Midwest farming states over the next six ten days 
46nc030y [tongue_click] Analysts said traders were shifting their emphasis away from last year\'s crop and to this year\'s 
46nc030z With this year\'s small acreage increases weather and spring planting conditions are major concerns to a market that is beginning to shake off a huge surplus 
46nc0310 The favorable conditions helped the soybean contract for November settlement close at six \.POINT eight two two five dollars a bushel down nine \.POINT five cents 
46nc0311 [tongue_click] Another executive explains the problems as the opposite of nineteen eighty seven 
46nc0312 Last year you had tumultuous swings in the markets themselves he says 
46nc0313 This year the environment will be . narrower swings but volume will be lower with revenues insufficient to cover costs 
46nc0314 More important than arithmetic however is Mr\. Jackson\'s message 
46nc0315 Speaking to black aspirations he represents the best of the American dream 
46nc0316 [tongue_click] He might even qualify as a social conservative if not for his endorsement of homosexual rights

46nc040g [tongue_click] If you look at the record the debate should be rather short 
46nc040h The winners obvious ~ 
46nc040i [tongue_click] The only tragedy and it\'s an amazing one is that most Americans don\'t even know what has been accomplished and how it came about 
46nc040j But inside Room seven hundred thirteen the Japanese see the situation somewhat differently 
46nc040k They reason like this If the U\. S\. imposes sanctions they most likely will be aimed at Japanese construction companies doing business in the U\. S\. 
46nc040l But that would hurt thousands of American workers who are employed either directly or indirectly by such companie(s)- ~

46nc040r If made practical they could bring spectacular changes to almost any electrical product or process 
46nc040s That could mean vastly faster and more energy efficient products such as computers cars and household appliances 
46nc040t Until the recent breakthrough superconductors had to be chilled to a hopelessly low temperature to work so except for a few applications there really was no technology 
46nc040u Mr\. Iacocca said that while the pricing actions increased sales they also squeezed Chrysler\'s profit margins 
46nc040v But he added that the Number three U\. S\. auto maker made a conscious decision to sacrifice profit for a higher market s- share 
46nc040w The move is behind Chrysler\'s recent decisions to increase production which in turn will boost profit for the rest of the year 
46nc040x [tongue_click] Critics argue that he may be overly optimistic though 
46nc040y And Mr\. Dukakis is certain to face more pressure on the question from Vice President Bush who supports both the M\. X\. and Midgetman 
46nc040z Moreover most of the members of Congress being considered as potential running mates for Governor Dukakis have backed one or the other missile plans

46pc0318 What\'s wrong with that 
46pc0319 Generally there\'s no limit on how much of their funds employees can borrow if their accounts total ten thousand dollars or less 
46pc031a [tongue_click] For larger accounts employees are restricted to borrowing half the total but no more than fifty thousand dollars 
46pc031b [tongue_click] Loans must be repaid within five years unless the money goes toward buying a principal residence in which case longer repayment terms can be arranged 
46pc031c Borrowed funds aren\'t taxed

46rc0301 [tongue_click] There\'s a certain awakening and stirring in the European microchip industry said Douglas Dunn managing director of the semiconductor division of Britain\'s Plessey Company 
46rc0302 [tongue_click] As part of that revival Plessey plans to open a fifty five million dollar British semiconductor plant next Tuesday 
46rc0303 With the facility Plessey hopes to triple its annual semiconductor sales to about five hundred million dollars by nineteen ninety 
46rc0304 Burlington has also been moving aggressively in court to counter the hostile bid 
46rc0305 Yesterday it filed its second lawsuit against the group and disclosed that it may turn the tables and seek to acquire control of m- Montreal based Dominion 
46rc0306 [loud_breath] The Pac Man defense is named after the video game in which a player tries to gobble up his foe before the player is swallowed 
46rc0307 These criticisms are overwrought and unconvincing 
46rc0308 While private operators will certainly lobby in their own interest it does not follow that they sh- could manipulate public opinion and lawmakers as easily as their opponents suggest 
46rc0309 Nor is it clear that private prison operators would have to lobby for harsher sentences 
46rc030a Given current levels of overcrowding and public sentiment in favor of stricter sentencing there will be no shortage of inmates to fill new facilities 
46rc030b Here are price trends on the world\'s major stock markets as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective Geneva 
46rc030c To make them directly comparable each index is based on the close of nineteen sixty nine equaling one hundred 
46rc030d The percentage change is since year end 
46rc030e Parts two and three are for people who have some interest that may not be deductible 
46rc030f Taxpayers must use the longer more complicated Part three if any of the proceeds from the loan went for trade or business expenses 
46rc030g Generally the interest of the portion of the loan that finances these expenses is deductible 
46rc030h But the order almost immediately generated intense controversy both inside and outside the cabinet 
46rc030i It became said one creditor the point of impact for debate on the entire rescheduling package and foreign debt 
46rc030j In September the president\'s most powerful adviser Executive Secretary Joker Arroyo told Congress that Mr\. Ongpin tricked Mrs\. Aquino into signing the order 
46rc030k Professional corporations 
46rc030l Taxes would go up for corporations consisting of lawyers doctors accountants and architects 
46rc030m [tongue_click] The provision would eliminate graduated rates for these personal service corporations so that they all would pay the flat thirty four \%PERCENT corporate rate 
46rc030n Why should foreign imports be a better measure of U\. S\. exports 
46rc030o And why are the export data so bad 
46rc030p [tongue_click] Import data are directly collected by a single government agency they provide revenue from tariffs and they provide politically important measures of goods subject to quotas 
46rc030q These aspects of import accounting encourage government agents to amass accurate import data 
46rc030r Conversely for exports self interest induces underreporting 
46rc030s There is no shortage of examples 
46rc030t Growing life expectancy threatens to bankrupt Social Security but the compromise of nineteen eighty three did little more than burden workers by raising the payroll tax 
46rc030u The government continues to pile up great deficits but the budget summit compromise of last autumn hardly cuts anything at all 
46rc030v Soviet influence in Nicaragua threatens U\. S\. security but the U\. S\. House engages in a pitched battle over even scraps of military hardware to the Contras 
46rc030w Meanwhile Audi set up a bonus plan to encourage dealership salespeople to sell Audi eighty and ninety cars newer models that carry far less generous incentives 
46rc030x Under the bonus plan Audi promised to give sales people two hundred fifty dollars every time they sold an eighty or ninety model 
46rc030y [tongue_click] Law officials from the Federal Trade Commission and several states have said they are opening inquiries into Audi\'s rebates 
46rc030z One million families fall into poverty each year because of the devastating costs of long term illness 
46rc0310 The private sector cannot solve the problem 
46rc0311 We need a social insurance program that will protect people of all ages against the financial burdens of long term illness 
46rc0312 The additional shares may be bought in the open market or in private transactions the filing said 
46rc0313 Pennant added however that its intention to raise its stake is subject to change 
46rc0314 A Bay spokesman declined to comment on the filing 
46rc0315 The E\. P\. A\. proposed minimum standards for municipal trash dumps that the agency estimated will cost eight hundred eighty seven [loud_breath] million dollars a year 
46rc0316 [tongue_click] The proposed rules require about six thousand dumps to install groundwater monitoring systems 
46rc0317 They would also close some dumps and put special conditions on others in certain areas 
46rc0318 The industrialized countries at Berlin will continue to stress tackling the debt problem on a case by case basis 
46rc0319 Economic assistance from bodies such as the I\. M\. F\. will remain conditional on economic changes in the debtor countries 
46rc031a Debt forgiveness except for the poorest countries in Africa will remain a matter for discreet negotiation 
46rc031b Quite possibly a recent profit sharing bonus helped 
46rc031c We don\'t have an elegant formula says Mr\. Barron 
46rc031d We said we think everyone\'s entitled to a share so here\'s a check 
46rc031e [tongue_click] Next year if we do well there may be a bigger check 
46rc031f Is this any way to run a railroad 
46rc031g Could be 
46rc0401 [tongue_click] Finally failure has a social value if an ignoble one 
46rc0402 If everyone were a success if the world were peopled only by success stories it would be a relentlessly boring place to live in 
46rc0403 Whom then would we have to look down upon 
46rc0404 As the saying goes It is not enough that I succeed 
46rc0405 My friends must fail also 
46rc0406 Any student of human nature knows this is only half a joke 
46rc0407 He is credited with drilling the presidents of Trust Company\'s eighteen Georgia banks on those fundamentals setting ambitious profit targets and holding the banks strictly accountable for reaching them 
46rc0408 Now Sun\'s twenty six Florida banks get the same treatment from Mr\. Williams 
46rc0409 [tongue_click] There\'s a lot of autonomy but you\'ve got to earn it says Thomas S\. Clark the marketing director at Sun\'s Polk County bank 
46rc040a [tongue_click] But Mr\. Morris indicated that the new chief executive\'s interests appeared to be elsewhere 
46rc040b After refinancing is complete improving the marketing operations at Flying Tiger is the focal point of his strategy at this point Mr\. Morris said 
46rc040c Tax credits also would be usable if the airline were to turn a large profit he noted

46rc040g [tongue_click] Mr\. Kelley\'s appointment still leaves one vacancy on the seven member Fed board 
46rc040h [tongue_click] President Reagan isn\'t expected to fill that seat which was vacated by Henry Wallich until he decides whether to reappoint Paul Volcker as chairman 
46rc040i Mr\. Volcker\'s term as chairman expires in August 
46rc040j The long distance phone industry and its customers are in a battle over billing for unconnected phone calls 
46rc040k The issue has produced a spate of lawsuits claims that individuals and businesses have been taken for millions of dollars and cries of coverup by some irate customers 
46rc040l California regulators are so concerned that they are considering barring many long distance companies from billing for perhaps a quarter of their traffic 
46rc040m It has been shown repeatedly that the public supports the basic idea of defending the U\. S\. from incoming ballistic missiles 
46rc040n If Mr\. Reagan wants S\. D\. I\. to be a lasting legacy of his administration it will be necessary to start building on the support that already exists 
46rc040o [tongue_click] That task will be made easier if the administration provides the developing evidence of the Soviet threat 
46rc040p Nor is the new chain\'s ethnic motif meant to imply culinary adventure 
46rc040q [tongue_click] Research shows that many consumers think Italian food has too much basil and garlic so such ingredients are used sparingly 
46rc040r Old world creativity in the kitchen gives way to laser beam precision local chefs aren\'t allowed to impulsively add a dash of anything 
46rc040s Diners aren\'t likely to consider their meals memorable the company concedes 
46rc040t But at least they won\'t be asking What\'s this weird tasting stuff says Mr\. Thompson 
46rc040u Western analysts have long believed that Pakistan is at least close to possessing the necessary materials and knowledge to build and test a bomb 
46rc040v The country has refused to sign the nuclear non proliferation treaty unless rival India which exploded its first nuclear device in nineteen seventy four does so 
46rc040w Pakistan has proposed various non proliferation controls on its own program but only if India agrees to the same controls

46rc0411 We\'ve been consistently saying that since April nineteen eighty seven when the P\. S\. two line was introduced 
46rc0412 If we kept changing directions I could see people questioning that 
46rc0413 This is the poorest land in the West beset by corruption illiteracy disease and a history of governments that seemingly have made those conditions policy goals 
46rc0414 Haiti\'s problems and peculiarities now seem so towering that the latest political twists probably won\'t mean much 
46rc0415 Western notions of progress and development fade in the smoke of a voodoo priest\'s flaming magic stones 
46rc0416 Tobacco heiress Doris Duke agreed to post five million dollars needed by Imelda Marcos to secure bail on racketeering charges 
46rc0417 Duke is the daughter of the former president of American Tobacco Company . Marcos and her husband the deposed president of the Philippines are accused of looting Manila\'s treasury

46sc0202 To make them directly comparable each index is based on the close of nineteen sixty nine equaling one hundred 
46sc0203 The percentage change is since year end 
46sc0204 But the new law also contains negatives for municipal bonds 
46sc0205 For people who must pay the alternative minimum tax the private purpose variety is now subject to tax 
46sc0206 And the lowering of tax brackets means that the shelter feature is less crucial than it once was 
46sc0207 In both the Hungarian and Suez crises [loud_breath] the United States proceeded in accord with the rule of avoiding direct confrontation with the Soviet Union 
46sc0208 In the Hungarian affair this meant doing nothing except talking because taking any practical step would at once have meant a confrontation 
46sc0209 In the Suez affair the avoidance of confrontation went all the way to the collaboration 
46sc020a By contrast the industrial communist nations have a fertility modestly above replacement 
46sc020b Third World countries have a T\. F\. R\. of four \.POINT one

46sc0213 [tongue_click] It didn\'t provide any details 
46sc0214 [loud_breath] Answer Yes without question 
46sc0215 [tongue_click] [loud_breath] It\'s my sense that there was a time when people thought they could trade on inside information with absolute impunity 
46sc0216 And that\'s no longer true 
46sc0217 Now I am certain that there are still people who think that they can trade on inside information and get away with it because they\'re smarter than the average person 
46sc0218 [loud_breath] There will always be those people 
46sc0219 [loud_breath] But I think that the actions have had a significant effect on conduct 
46sc021a Back when official lines stayed put Intourist guides had it easy 
46sc021b [loud_breath] With epic propaganda and torrents of statistics they glibly praised the Soviet Union\'s eternal progress 
46sc021c [loud_breath] A place like Katyn where Stalin may have proved himself no better than Hitler wasn\'t on anybody\'s itinerary 
46sc021d [loud_breath] But the Russians now seem on the brink of owning up to the Katyn atrocity

46sc030a The Philip Morris magazine enjoys by far the highest circulation of any company magazine seven \.POINT two million copies 
46sc030b The only requirement is that you have to be an adult to receive the magazine says Mary Taylor associate publisher 
46sc030c That\'s not because of any racy articles but because the tobacco industry has been accused of trying to snatch twelve and thirteen year olds 
46sc030d Philip Morris is even considering selling space to outside advertisers [loud_breath] it already ran an ad for Time magazine on a test basis in its winter nineteen eighty seven issue 
46sc030e General Ramos also confirmed for the first time that Philippine authorities [loud_breath] were looking into possible foreign involvement in the coup attempt the Associated Press reported 
46sc030f General Ramos said the military was investigating the presence of some foreign personnel [loud_breath] near armed forces headquarters during the uprising 
46sc030g He declined to elaborate 
46sc030h Nevertheless some analysts say the Fed already may be tightening credit slightly 
46sc030i They point to recent increases in the federal funds rate which is the rate on reserves that banks lend to each other overnight 
46sc030j The funds rate averaged s- seven and five eighths \%PERCENT yesterday and Tuesday up from an average of seven \.POINT four three \%PERCENT in the week ended October seventh 
46sc030k These analysts argue that the increase was engineered by the Fed 
46sc030l Judge Bork\'s likely defeat is a turning point in our constitutional history [loud_breath] precisely because it is not a turning point 
46sc030m Never before has a Supreme Court nominee been defeated because of his general approach to the Constitution

46sc030s Excluding one time gains and losses Citicorp\'s nineteen eighty seven profit would have been one \.POINT one five billion dollars 
46sc030t Excluded are gains on real estate in the fourth quarter [tongue_click] and pension assets in the third quarter plus the effect of the reserve addition

46sc0310 [loud_breath] A McCormick vice president at- attributes women\'s gains at the company to a deep rooted work ethic and a strong desire for success 
46sc0311 The trade bill would direct presidential action against countries that permit piracy of U\. S\. intellectual property 
46sc0312 [loud_breath] It would require the president to identify countries that don\'t protect copyrights and patents [loud_breath] and to initiate expedited unfair trade investigations in the most egregious cases 
46sc0313 [loud_breath] The president could decline to move against certain countries if doing so would be against the national economic interest though 
46sc0314 Congress wants speedy action because time often can be critical in winning protection for certain intellectual property such as computer [<misc_noise] software which can be copied rapidly

46sc031b [loud_breath] Mr\. Martens said Vitro wasn\'t prepared to agree to that condition 
46sc031c He said Apparently Anchor is concerned that the information it is offering to provide will give Vitro a basis for lowering the price

46sc0406 The firm has cooperated with the U\. S\. Attorney\'s office throughout the investigation and will continue to do so 
46sc0407 Meanwhile the agency said it will conduct a study on its own 
46sc0408 [loud_breath] Officials said the review may lead to new regulations for data processing systems 
46sc0409 [loud_breath] The agency may also challenge past charges to the Pentagon

46sc040b It\'s the life of an entrepreneur and the fate of creativity in a modern financially oriented America Mr\. Lucas says warming to the subject 
46sc040c [lip_smack] It\'s about what happens to a society when it grows old and tries to keep the status quo instead of letting its more creative instincts take over 
46sc040d [loud_breath] Although Tucker is set in the nineteen forties Mr\. Lucas makes it clear he thinks the film\'s subject is current and quite personal 
46sc040e [loud_breath] Bullion dealers say the five houses fixing the gold price have to respond to the needs of the market and requirements of British financial legislation [loud_breath] 
46sc040f [tongue_click] As a group the five bullion firms transact less business than outside market makers several London bullion traders say

46sc040l [loud_breath] Many of the pressure groups that campaigned unsuccessfully against Mr\. Reagan in two presidential campaigns seem to regard this battle as their Armageddon 
46sc040m [tongue_click] [loud_breath] Teddy Kennedy himself has testified that Judge Bork\'s appearance means the end is near 
46sc040n If Ronald Reagan wants Robert Bork confirmed he will have to create an alternative choice to the one these groups are trying to force on undecided senators 
46sc040o That means Mr\. Reagan has to explain clearly why American society will benefit if judges such as Robert Bork apply the r- law in a neutral manner 
46sc040p [loud_breath] He will have to point out why s- many of the long held grievances of the electorate result when unelected judges manufacture new laws 
46sc040q Mr\. Antoniu\'s fall and surprising rebound prove there is life after insider trading 
46sc040r But his story also suggests that some character traits that may give rise to intr- insider trading can be hard to change 
46sc040s Insider trading is a form of fraud and some Sport About franchisees now claim they have been defrauded by Mr\. Antoniu 
46sc040t Pet owners often call a pet psychic because a pet is sick and they want a detailed account of how it\'s feeling 
46sc040u And some pet psychics claim they can chat with pets from a distance 
46sc040v For example Gay Travers a former publicist called pet psychic Penelope Smith when her cat Sebastian was very ill 
46sc040w [loud_breath] Ms\. Smith told her to hang up while the psychic talked to Sebastian 
46sc040x Three minutes later she called back with some bad news 
46sc040y Lost wages [loud_breath] Some economics are dismayed at the Labor Department\'s plans to drop the hourly earnings index from its monthly employment report next year 
46sc040z [loud_breath] It\'s a fashionable number said Mr\. Chandross of Lloyd\'s Bank New York 
46sc0410 Economists are currently focusing on the index to get a reading of wage inflation 
46sc0411 The Labor Department will continue to report monthly aggregate data on average hourly earnings 
46sc0412 But the index is being replaced by the employment cost series 
46sc0413 Economists said that the new index has the advantage of being a more reliable reading [loud_breath] and the disadvantage of coming out only once a quarter rather [<misc_noise] than every month 
46sc0414 Newspapers\' costs are up sharply this year largely because of higher newsprint prices the industry\'s biggest cost behind labor expenses 
46sc0415 Since October nineteen eighty six prices have risen three times by a total of about twenty one \%PERCENT 
46sc0416 Newspapers have responded by using lighter weight paper trimming page size and cutting the space for news 
46sc0417 Meanwhile civil RICO continues to attract plaintiffs who want to turn general business disputes that belong in state courts into federal offenses 
46sc0418 For example a small consortium of contractors who consulted me had submitted the low bid for a large marina to be constructed on Lake Michigan 
46sc0419 The second lowest bidder recently filed a civil RICO action [loud_breath] claiming that misrepresentations were made by the successful bidders using the telephone thereby committing federal wire fraud

46tc020a If American and its union can\'t reach a settlement by then the airline can impose its latest contract *offer* or lock out its flight attendants 
46tc020b The Association of Professional Flight Attendants also would be free to strike but it said it doesn\'t plan to do so 
46tc020c [tongue_click] The lastest disclosures are an outgrowth of that probe 
46tc020d Already the Department of Transportation has accused Delta Airlines and Eastern Airlines of engaging in unrealistic scheduling at Atlanta\'s Hartsfield Airport 
46tc020e The carriers deny this but the government has expanded its probe

46tc020w Wall Street analysts look to the interest in Houston based *Enron* Corp\.\'s oil and gas operations as a gauge of likely interest in Tenneco\'s properties 
46tc020x In late April Enron an integrated natural gas concern put oil and gas assets up for sale 
46tc020y [tongue_click] Analysts valued those properties at two billion dollars and one said Enron has received about twenty offers

46tc0211 Some singled out as contradictory a cooking oil ad telling people how to cut down on cholesterol [loud_breath] but featuring fried chicken and french fries 
46tc0212 It is also dishonest some said to omit information or hide it in small print

46tc0216 It\'s business as usual 
46tc0217 Volume is no different 
46tc0218 The market hasn\'t changed character 
46tc0219 So far from a market viewpoint it doesn\'t look to be much of an event 
46tc021a Ever since he took office three and a half years ago Mr\. Gorbachev has sought to increase foreign trade\'s meager share of the Soviet economy 
46tc021b Rather than simply import more Western goods he would like to obtain the machinery and know how to enable the Soviets to make the goods themselves 
46tc021c [lip_smack] To do so he opened up the economy to foreign capital and equipment by permitting joint ventures 
46tc021d [lip_smack] He returned home in time for his fifteenth birthday in March nineteen eighty six 
46tc021e [lip_smack] [loud_breath] As part of the treatment he attended fifteen weeks of after care five days a week

46tc0303 Officials say television warnings will follow 
46tc0304 The issue is so sensitive here says bond analyst Daniel Scotto of L\. F\. Rothschild Unterberg and Towbin 
46tc0305 We are all concerned that the regulators can sit back and wait for credit to carry the company out into the horizon 
46tc0306 But he added the bankers are waiting for commitments from the regulators and the regulators are waiting for commitments from the bankers 
46tc0307 In heavy trading Friday profit taking caused the Nikkei average to slip seventy \.POINT one eight to twenty one thousand one zero five \.POINT eight five

46tc030h [tongue_click] Selling the Canadian business will help T\. L\. C\. Group complete its financing on the rest of Beatrice international operations 
46tc030i T\. L\. C\. Group said yesterday that it has a firm commitment from Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc\. its investment banker to finance its acquisition 
46tc030j A Drexel spokesman said he expects the financing to come through a combination of bank loans and high yield bonds

46tc030l I\. R\. E\. has downsized its real estate i- syndication business and is primarily a savings and loan holding company Mr\. Levan said 
46tc030m Earnings in the past were somewhat erratic quarter to quarter because the major business was real estate syndication 
46tc030n Now the S\. and L\. holding company is the main business with down sized w- real estate syndication 
46tc030o Core earnings are very consistent 
46tc030p Another option would be going private in a leveraged buy out 
46tc030q But analysts said management wouldn\'t prefer such a plan because it would mean curtailing the company\'s ambitious store expansion program 
46tc030r In a leveraged buy out a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely with borrowing 
46tc030s [lip_smack] Ultimately the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company\'s operations or the sale of its assets 
46tc030t People he points out come to him now

46tc030x It\'s a reputation with a growing credibility to it 
46tc030y A spokesman for Cray described the M\. I\. T\. decision as good news 
46tc030z [lip_smack] Assuming the bidding does open up again it means there\'s room for technical considerations and not considerations based purely on price 
46tc0310 The spokesman said it would have been impossible for Cray to install and operate a complete supercom:puter system at the prices M\. I\. T\. wanted to pay 
46tc0311 [tongue_click] But while nickel and especially copper quotes have since rebounded aluminum prices have continued to tumble 
46tc0312 [tongue_click] It seems to be in people\'s interest to keep the price down right now said one London exchange trader 
46tc0313 This will ultimately give them more buying opportunities down the line 
46tc0314 [tongue_click] Prices on the upscale Acura division\'s base model cars jumped even higher than the Honda division\'s prices 
46tc0315 The Acura Integra jumped three \.POINT five \%PERCENT or three hundred and seventy dollars to ten thousand nine hundred and fifteen dollars 
46tc0316 The luxury Legend sedan increased in price two \.POINT five \%PERCENT or five hundred and twenty five dollars to twenty three thousand six hundred and seventy five dollars 
46tc0317 [tongue_click] And the Legend coupe rose two \.POINT five \%PERCENT or five hundred and seventy nine dollars to twenty three thousand six hundred and seventy five dollars 
46tc0318 [tongue_click] Mr\. Peroni agreed that the U\. S\. currency is a positive factor for stock prices 
46tc0319 The better behavior of the dollar is a big incentive for foreign and domestic institutions to stick both feet in the water he said 
46tc031a He predicted that the Dow Jones industrials could be as high as upper twenty two hundreds by the end of the summer 
46tc031b [tongue_click] However John Mendelson chief market analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds believes such a slump could happen 
46tc031c I think you would go back to normal turnover levels in a bear market 
46tc031d You have to go through nineteen seventy four to see a real dull lousy market

46tc0404 [tongue_click] But it will take a lot of acquisitions for specialty *retailing* to have much effect on Sears\'s bottom line 
46tc0405 Sears\'s merchandise group alone generated profit of seven hundred and sixty five \.POINT seven million dollars in nineteen eighty five 
46tc0406 Indeed analysts say that in the past Sears may have been hesitant to buy specialty stores because they wouldn\'t quickly contribute to profit 
46tc0407 However a Sears spokesman said yesterday that the company doesn\'t have any qualifications [loud_breath] about how quickly or how much specialty acquisitions would have to contribute to earnings

46tc040d [loud_breath] The investment unit said it will use proceeds to buy customer accounts receivable growing out of the parent\'s retail sales 
46tc040e [lip_smack] Proceeds may also be used to retire short term borrowings the unit said 
46tc040f Chrysler said recent production declines are related to the closing of a number of plants for conversion 
46tc040g As previously announced the company\'s Belvidere Illinois car assembly plant is closed for an eighteen week plant conversion

46uc020e No level of technical safeguards can make a nuclear facility safe unless it has good management the N\. R\. C\. told Congress last year 
46uc020f Indeed the agency recently has begun to close plants because of management not just mechanical shortcomings

46wc030i Other courts notably the one in charge of the Manville Corporation Chapter eleven proceedings have set up trust funds to pay large classes of injury victims 
46wc030j But Manville\'s two and a half billion to three billion trust includes provisions that allow it to expand if funds prove inadequate to pay *asbestos* related ch- claims 
46wc030k [other_mouth_sound] So far no judge has attempted to fix an absolute cap on a group of claims as huge and uncertain as those facing Robins 
46wc030l Another bank trader attributes the dollar\'s rebound to Fed officials\' increased openness about their activities 
46wc030m They\'re trying to get the biggest bang for the buck right now the trader says 
46wc030n They want people to run out and say The Fed\'s buying the Fed\'s buying 
46wc030o That\'s what\'s significantly different about the Fed\'s intervention this year 
46wc030p Dow President Frank Popoff said in a statement that both price and volume increases bolstered earnings

46wc0314 The son of a retired air force officer [other_mouth_sound] he lives quietly with his wife and two daughters in a small house in Santiago 
46wc0315 He prefers the Scientific American to the weekly news magazines

46wc0318 [other_mouth_sound] The appointment continued to languish and on June first Doctor Sullivan called Mr\. Fulton and suggested that he withdraw his name for consideration 
46wc0319 Doctor Sullivan has concluded that even if he pushed the Fulton nomination through the White House and the Senate the price of victory would be too high 
46wc031a He would have incurred the wrath of the right to life movement and I would have been the enemy Mr\. Fulton says 
46wc0401 But Texas American may have its problems with the proposed combination of RepublicBank and InterFirst 
46wc0402 By virtue of their size alone they will be dominant in the state Mr\. Grant added 
46wc0403 Exactly what impact that competition will have is difficult to assess now he said 
46wc0404 Earlier this fall Tandem borrowed seven million dollars from Foothill Capital Corporation under a secured revolving credit line of as much as eight million dollars 
46wc0405 [tongue_click] Also [other_mouth_sound] a four million dollar short term loan from Xerox Corporation was converted into a long term note 
46wc0406 The note is convertible into Tandem common stock 
46wc0407 Like their economies the currencies of the U\. S\. and Canada are closely related 
46wc0408 But as interest rates rise in Canada the Canadian dollar is gaining on its U\. S\. counterpart traders and na- analysts say 
46wc0409 And as the Canadian unit rises it lures more foreign investment partic- particularly from Japan which adds to its strength 
46wc040a Mr\. Cruz said he had set deadlines for the implementation of the reforms he was proposing 
46wc040b [tongue_click] He said for example that he has expected that the integration of the new rebel army would be completed by the end of June 
46wc040c He warned that he would denounce any effort to sidetrack the reforms indicating that he would leave the rebel organization if his plans weren\'t carried out

46wc040j Mr\. Abboud also gained a reputation during the First Chicago years as being abrasive and sometimes harsh with subordinates and that tag has lingered

46wc040r Mr\. Brody will remain president and chief executive 
46wc040s A federal district court and an appeals court both in Richmond upheld the plan 
46wc040t But in nineteen eighty six the Supreme Court told the appeals court to reconsider its position in light of another high court ruling 
46wc040u Last July the appeals court struck down the plan ruling that affirmative action must be based on evidence that the city itself had discriminated in the past

46wc0410 [other_mouth_sound] Agfa Gevaert announced last week it would seek to acquire the eighty nine \%PERCENT of Matrix it didn\'t already own for ten dollars a share 
46wc0411 Matrix said at that time that it -(it)s board reviewed the offer but the results of that review weren\'t announced 
46wc0412 The advertisement announcing the tender offer says a merger agreement was reached between the two firms last week 
46wc0413 In a related matter a review commission administrative law judge on October eighteenth threw out OSHA citations against Morrell 
46wc0414 The citations issued in April nineteen eighty seven charged record keeping violations 
46wc0415 The official disallowed OSHA\'s instant by instant citation which proposed a total fine of six hundred and ninety thousand dollars 
46wc0416 The official also said OSHA didn\'t issue the citation within the six months suh- specified by law from the time an official inspection begins 
46wc0417 Investors continue to flock to the more conservative stock portfolios 
46wc0418 Growth and income funds which combine hefty dividends with the goal of capital appreciation led all other stock fund categories in sales for June 
46wc0419 [other_mouth_sound] *Among* bond funds long term municipal funds captured the top spot

46xc0206 The point Virtually every advertiser in every medium is paying to reach viewers or readers who never become customers 
46xc0207 Mr\. Li made his announcement yesterday after the stock market here had closed 
46xc0208 But news of the planned offering had leaked earlier in the day when his companies sought a suspension in trading of their shares 
46xc0209 [lip_smack] [loud_breath] The market fell sending the Hang Seng index fifty two points lower at one point 
46xc020a [loud_breath] The index later recovered to close with a ten \.POINT sixty six points loss [loud_breath] at three thousand six four nine \.POINT eight four 
46xc020b Another incentive that food processors cite for getting into the restaurant business is the high cost of introducing new grocery items 
46xc020c [lip_smack] [loud_breath] Starting a new brand can easily cost General Mills more than twenty million in development and promotion costs 
46xc020d Of course the Olive Garden start up brick and mortar and all has cost five times that 
46xc020e [loud_breath] Lawrence Fleisher the union\'s general counsel said the union has sought an expedited proceeding in the hope of avoiding a lockout or strike

46xc020n [tongue_click] It has refused requests to see him from both his family and his lawyer 
46xc020o But network officials will spend months debating C\. B\. S\.\'s wisdom 
46xc020p It\'s time to be aggressive said Mr\. Pilson testily taking on reporters at yesterday\'s press conference 
46xc020q [loud_breath] I\'m up here stating C\. B\. S\. has acquired the rights [loud_breath] and N\. B\. C\. hasn\'t

46xc020t One former investigator who worked on the Presser investigation said the Justice Department\'s civil suit breathes new life into dormant investigations of the Teamsters leader 
46xc020u [loud_breath] The ex Labor Department investigator [loud_breath] noted that the burden of proof required in a RICO civil suit is less than under criminal statutes 
46xc020v [loud_breath] He said additional evidence against Mr\. Presser should be easier to gain through pretrial depositions and discovery

46xc020x If we had two hundred fifty copies we might have found one hundred different viruses he said 
46xc020y He termed the speed of mutation extraordinary and compared the AIDS virus with other swiftly changing viruses such as influenza 
46xc020z [loud_breath] Another potential point of contention is the E\. C\.\'s plan [loud_breath] to allow the free flow of people across borders 
46xc0210 Switzerland already has attracted one million resident aliens a portion of its population greater than in any E\. C\. state except Luxembourg 
46xc0211 Most Swiss think that it is enough and the country has imposed foreign worker quotas so strict that skilled labor [loud_breath] is in short supply 
46xc0212 [loud_breath] Yet if Switzerland closes its doors to more E\. C\. nationals Swiss who work in the E\. C\. may find themselves less welcome 
46xc0213 [loud_breath] He is striking now at a time when financing for big deals [loud_breath] is readily available and the stock price is down 
46xc0214 [loud_breath] As recently as August R\. J\. R\.\'s stock was trading lower [loud_breath] than its forty nine dollar level [loud_breath] when Mr\. Johnson took over in January nineteen eighty seven 
46xc0215 The offer for a leveraged buy out probably will be at about seventy five dollars a share and now other s- tobacco stocks are soaring too 
46xc0216 [loud_breath] S\. E\. C\. Chairman David Ruder presented the unanimous position of the five member commission at a meeting yesterday of securities regulators in Melbourne Australia 
46xc0217 Mr\. Ruder said that an effective regulatory framework for a global market should include efficient systems for disseminating market data on prices and trading volume and for executing trades 
46xc0218 [loud_breath] He added that ultimately [loud_breath] all countries should set up automated systems for clearing and settling equity and debt transactions [loud_breath] and that many such systems should be linked 
46xc0219 [loud_breath] The government source who requested anonymity [loud_breath] said the measure would allow for the confiscation of funds in addition to fines and imprisonment 
46xc021a [loud_breath] Local press reports said fines of up to fifty million Luxembourg francs or one \.POINT four million dollars and prison terms of up to five years could be imposed 
46xc021b The proposed law is expected to gain parliamentary approval and go into effect next year 
46xc021c The Communists couldn\'t solve Poland\'s economic problems so they needed to bring in Solidarity he says 
46xc021d [loud_breath] In China too the conservative leaders can\'t overcome our economic difficulties 
46xc021e [loud_breath] They will need our help 
46xc0301 The new government has started to lower personal income taxes [loud_breath] and at the same time it has begun to bring its own spending under control 
46xc0302 [loud_breath] In the nineteen eighty seven budget the highest rate of income tax was lowered to fifty eight \%PERCENT from sixty five \%PERCENT 
46xc0303 [loud_breath] This is part of a world wide movement that France must follow to keep its most energetic aggressive and bright young people and to attract investors 
46xc0304 The new tax law\'s limits on retirement benefits for executives spur greater interest in certain trusts that help safeguard deferred compensation until retirement time 
46xc0305 [loud_breath] Such trusts aren\'t completely inviolate creditors can claim the money after a bankruptcy for instance 
46xc0306 But they are considered better than a mere promise to the executive 
46xc0307 [loud_breath] The Diet is a one house legislature apportioned by district rather than population like the Senate as opposed to the House 
46xc0308 [loud_breath] This means that Japanese farmers have tremendous control over Japanese politics 
46xc0309 Food prices in Japan take forty \%PERCENT or more of the average person\'s wage 
46xc030a With housing taking another forty \%PERCENT and the fact that the Japanese are great savers they are left with almost no discretionary income 
46xc030b This is why they cannot develop a domestic market 
46xc030c They don\'t have enough money to spend except a small amount of savings [loud_breath] that they spend only on special occasions or for unusual bargains 
46xc030d Consequently Lloyd\'s and some brokers may be forced to increase their share of the settlement payment 
46xc030e Yesterday Minet Holdings P\. L\. C\. said its planned ten \.POINT five million contribution could rise to twelve \.POINT five million 
46xc030f [loud_breath] Lloyd\'s declined to speculate about how much its contribution might increase 
46xc030g Fox has also stirred up advertiser interest because it has performed well in some markets especially big cities like New York and Washington [loud_breath] where it owns and operates stations 
46xc030h In Washington twenty one Jump Street has been the Number one or Number two show in its time period according to Mr\. Kellner 
46xc030i [loud_breath] Married With Children has *regularly* scored higher than one or two of the offerings on the three networks he adds 
46xc030j [tongue_click] In New York some Fox programs have also garnered higher ratings than shows on the three networks 
46xc030k [loud_breath] As previously reported the investigation of Matthews and Wright has led to an unprecedented examination of the largely unregulated seven hundred thirty billion dollar municipal bond market 
46xc030l This in turn has led to calls from financiers and politicians [loud_breath] for closer regulation of this huge market 
46xc030m [loud_breath] The investigation centers on whether bond issues [loud_breath] sold as tax exempt by Matthews and Wright and other underwriters actually warrant tax exempt status 
46xc030n [loud_breath] Most Arab states broke off relations with Egypt when that country signed a peace treaty with Israel eight years ago 
46xc030o [lip_smack] [loud_breath] Oman Sudan and Somalia didn\'t cut relations with Egypt 
46xc030p Jordan and Djibouti did but have since restored relations 
46xc030q [loud_breath] Mr\. Perry fifty five years old joined Canadair in May nineteen eighty four and is in charge of sales of the company\'s Challenger business jet 
46xc030r [loud_breath] Mr\. Perry wasn\'t available for comment but a Canadair spokeswoman said the indictment was quite a shock both to the company and to Mr\. Perry 
46xc030s [loud_breath] He\'s an outstanding executive she added 
46xc030t Jim Poyner an analyst with Rauscher Pierce Refsnes Incorporated in Dallas said they the group may run into some resistance from outside shareholders 
46xc030u The company is worth at least a few dollars per share more than this 
46xc030v [loud_breath] I think if another company were trying to buy Sterling they\'d have to pay more than this 
46xc030w The continuing prospect of lower interest rates sent stock prices up sharply 
46xc030x The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up twenty eight \.POINT eighteen points at nineteen fifty eight \.POINT twenty two 
46xc030y Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled [loud_breath] two hundred eleven \.POINT nine million shares up from one hundred sixty six \.POINT four million shares traded Thursday 
46xc030z [loud_breath] Advancing issues led decliners one thousand fifty four to four hundred eighty three 
46xc0310 [tongue_click] [loud_breath] In a statement Nymex effectively told Comex to back off 
46xc0311 [lip_smack] [loud_breath] And it suggested that Comex is to blame for the delay specifically the fact that Mr\. Brody next month will rel(inquish)- -(re)linquish his chairmanship for an exchange member 
46xc0312 [loud_breath] Mr\. Brody will remain president and chief executive 
46xc0313 Still Ms\. Freedman noted that a bright forecast for hiring isn\'t necessarily all good news 
46xc0314 The increasing use of labor may be because of a tremendous boom in the output of goods and services she said 
46xc0315 But it also might be because you aren\'t improving the efficiency with which you use the labor force the productivity 
46xc0316 Richard Roslund a vice president of block trading at Kidder Peabody said the Fed chairman\'s remarks gave the market a reason to adopt a more positive outlook 
46xc0317 People are just looking for anything to grasp on he said 
46xc0318 [loud_breath] It\'s been such a pessimistic atmosphere in the past couple of weeks 
46xc0319 Analysts say they expect P\. and G\'s momentum to carry into nineteen ninety and beyond and many raised their fiscal nineteen ninety estimates 
46xc031a Brenda Lee Landry of Morgan Stanley raised her estimate to eight dollars and thirty cents from an earlier estimate of eight dollars and fifteen cents 
46xc031b Kidder\'s Mr\. Freedman and Joseph Kozloff at Drexel Burnham Lambert raised their estimates to eight dollars and fifty cents a share from eight dollars twenty five cents 
46xc031c [loud_breath] I can see a number close to ten dollars for nineteen ninety one says Mr\. Kozloff 
46xc031d [loud_breath] Europe by contrast offers a cornucopia of undervalued corporations [loud_breath] and a wave of industrial restructuring stemming from its drive toward a single market by nineteen ninety two 
46xc031e In Spain U\. S\. investment banks took a huge chunk of the recent batch of bank mergers 
46xc031f Shearson helped Italian financier Carlo De Benedetti make a pioneering albeit unsuccessful hostile bid for the giant Belgian holding company Societe Generale de Belgique last year 
46xc0401 From Mr\. Casey\'s and Mr\. Gates\'s testimony it remains uncertain how specific Lieutenant Colonel North was at the October luncheon 
46xc0402 Critics of the director have argued that he followed a calculated pattern of removing himself from knowledge of what the former National Security Council staff member was doing 
46xc0403 [loud_breath] Mr\. Casey has cast himself as taking orders in some cases from the lieutenant colonel <a> a source said 
46xc0404 [loud_breath] More generally within the C\. I\. A\. operatives are vague about what they observed of the private supply network 
46xc0405 [loud_breath] One North Korean assertion [loud_breath] does have a certain scary credibility to it 
46xc0406 North Korea says that blowing up an expensive dam to flood the South would be a waste of good explosives 
46xc0407 [loud_breath] To do the job would take a blast equivalent to a nuclear bomb 
46xc0408 Better to drop it directly on Seoul 
46xc0409 [loud_breath] That would be a hundred times better in destructive effect says Li Choong Sung the vice chairman of the North Korean power commission 
46xc040a Farm banks account for a major portion of the rising numbers of bank failures 
46xc040b Of the one hundred thirty eight federally insured banks that failed last year fifty nine had made more than a quarter of their loans in agriculture 
46xc040c More than half of these farm banks were in Kansas Iowa Missouri and Nebraska 
46xc040d Even less appreciated is the turmoil that often results for women 
46xc040e [loud_breath] When he started becoming impotent I had all kinds of worries and strange thoughts says Maggie a Boston woman who lives with her fiance 
46xc040f [loud_breath] I thought I was doing something wrong [loud_breath] or that he didn\'t love me or that he was gay 
46xc040g She says it was a wonderful relief when doctors traced his problem to nerve damage from back surgery and treated it with a muscle relaxing drug 
46xc040h [lip_smack] [loud_breath] And among white South Africans the government\'s effort has plenty of support 
46xc040i [loud_breath] Many particularly the Afrikaners who have been defending their way of life for three centuries strongly back the army\'s campaign against Communist forces in Angola and Namibia 
46xc040j [loud_breath] They are equally determined to repel African National Congress terrorism inside South Africa

46xc040o [loud_breath] Mr\. Hamm who was here to meet with some of his clients among the OPEC countries [loud_breath] said supply and demand in the oil market is balanced 
46xc040p But he said it\'s balanced at fifteen dollars to sixteen dollars a barrel 
46xc040q [lip_smack] [loud_breath] That is two dollars to three dollars a barrel less [loud_breath] than the exporters were receiving last year 
46xc040r [loud_breath] If there is a reduction in supply as a result of the joint meetings prices will shoot up Mr\. Hamm said 
46xc040s [loud_breath] Carbide\'s sabotage theory is [loud_breath] weakened partly because it hasn\'t disclosed all its evidence 
46xc040t Though its attorneys say they have interviewed the alleged saboteur extensively they won\'t disclose his name or whereabouts or describe him 
46xc040u They also decline to say whether they understand his motives or have any witnesses 
46xc040v Stanford now chooses not to require its undergraduates to study their Western heritage but that history does yield certain lessons 
46xc040w One of them is that minorities that do not respond effectively to attacks from the majority merely encourage further assaults 
46xc040x [loud_breath] Perhaps the Hoover overseers should keep that in mind when they ponder the latest affront to Glenn Campbell next week 
46xc040y [loud_breath] The offer is a brilliant defense contrived by Santa Fe\'s investment bankers [loud_breath] at Salomon Brothers and Goldman Sachs 
46xc040z [loud_breath] The sixty three dollar a share price will hang over the negotiations like smog over Los Angeles 
46xc0410 [loud_breath] And though Mr\. Dingman will offer package after package that seems to add up to sixty three dollars he doesn\'t really plan to meet the asking price 
46xc0411 Instead he hopes to persuade Santa Fe to take less 
46xc0412 Separately Judge Browning issued a ruling on the award of any damages in the case 
46xc0413 For claims in the federal case the standard of damages is out of pocket or the investors\' loss on the bonds 
46xc0414 [loud_breath] For Washington state claims the standard is recission which could mean repaying bondholders their purchase price 
46xc0415 [loud_breath] The dispute is a classic confrontation between market philosophies 
46xc0416 Washington believes that Japan profits from free U\. S\. markets [loud_breath] and should reciprocate with completely free Japanese markets 
46xc0417 Tokyo government bureaucrats claim to favor free markets in practice they often are loath to relinquish complete control especially in promising industries 
46xc0418 [loud_breath] Long a secretive partnership Proudfoot now aims to muscle its way toward the top of the consulting industry 
46xc0419 It has the financial backing of a big British investment firm M\. I\. M\. Britannia Limited and went public last year 
46xc041a It used the two hundred twenty one million dollars in proceeds to buy out a handful of older partners

46yc020c Last week Salomon Brothers Inc\. launched its Salomon Russell Global Equity Index tracking three \.POINT five hundred and sixty five trillion dollars of equities world wide 
46yc020d Three similar measures are already available 
46yc020e Laszlo Birinyi Junior vice president for Salomon\'s equity market analysis group says We\'re trying to provide reliable consistent information on global securities 
46yc020f Bankers say Chile Mexico and the Philippines have accounted for most of the estimated six billion dollars of debt equity swaps to date 
46yc020g Some bankers have estimated that the total may rise as high as ten billion dollars this year 
46yc020h Such swaps only began about three years ago 
46yc020i Albert Gross chief economist at Refco Inc\. agreed 
46yc020j The bond market was helped temporarily by a decline in gold and other commodity prices a strengthening dollar and a stock market rally he said 
46yc020k But I expect the dollar to continue falling and that will accelerate inflation pressures 
46yc020l The best numbers on inflation are behind us 
46yc020m Most of the damage to stock prices came in the late afternoon as bond prices sagged adding fuel to the fire of interest rate fears 
46yc020n Bonds in turn seemed to be reacting to a decline in the dollar off its highs early in the day 
46yc020o The dollar nevertheless showed a gain for the day against both the yen and the West German mark 
46yc020p Bids totaling three hundred and seventy six million dollars were submitted 
46yc020q Accepted bids ranged from seven \.POINT fifteen \%PERCENT to seven \.POINT one seven three \%PERCENT 
46yc020r The bank holding company slated another fifty million dollar sale next Tuesday 
46yc020s Mr\. Reagan\'s comments don\'t reflect any change in his interpretation of the deficit reduction agreement 
46yc020t At the insistence of the White House the plan specifically noted that the president could either sign or veto the specific taxes Congress chooses 
46yc020u And the administration has said before that it isn\'t happy with the provision on takeovers 
46yc020v However such an agreement may yet occur 
46yc020w There\'s a lot brewing here said one source close to Apple 
46yc020x This is only the first of several related announcements and undertakings 
46yc020y The source said technical agreements are easier to hammer out than marketing agreements 
46yc020z Mobil based in New York said its fourth quarter net income jumped ninety two \%PERCENT 
46yc0210 The latest quarter included a one hundred and forty million dollar write down of foreign inventories 
46yc0211 Revenue rose twenty five \%PERCENT to fifteen \.POINT sixty six billion dollars from twelve \.POINT five billion dollars 
46yc0212 In recent months the quota program itself has become increasingly controversial 
46yc0213 Some big U\. S\. steelmakers which sell semifinished steel to the domestic marketplace are fighting to continue quotas after their scheduled expiration September thirtieth 
46yc0214 Others though dependent on outside supplies of semifinished are pushing to end quotas 
46yc0215 The Singapore government invites foreign newspapers to print the truth about Singapore 
46yc0216 But why has The Asian Wall Street Journal refused to print government replies correcting errors and biases in its reporting 
46yc0217 Why does it deny the Singapore government the simple right to reply 
46yc0218 One big play last year was leisure 
46yc0219 Another was undervalued assets even though no one can recall a Japanese company being broken up for its assets 
46yc021a Once you get that theme the level of the P\. E\. ratio doesn\'t mean a damn says Mr\. Robins 
46yc021b It\'s all a bit of a mirage 
46yc021c Yet one that so far has worked 
46yc021d Nine month results also include a twelve million dollar net loss from the disposition of trucking operations 
46yc021e About eight million dollars of the trucking charge was taken in the third quarter 
46yc021f Year earlier results were restated for accounting changes 
46yc0301 When Mrs\. Higa took over the business in nineteen sixty six frozen pizza was still a long shot 
46yc0302 The average Japanese didn\'t have freezer space let alone an oven 
46yc0303 And the most common response to supermarket taste tests was that cheese looked and tasted like soap she recalls 
46yc0304 But she kept going peddling her pizzas to restaurants and fancy hotels 
46yc0305 Smokers are feeling the heat because companies are taking a harder line on such issues as productivity rising medical costs and the effects of passive smoke 
46yc0306 Although there are conflicting claims about whether smokers cost employers more in terms of higher insurance rates and absenteeism companies often cite such concerns to justify restrictive smoking policies 
46yc0307 In addition new state and local ordinances and employee complaints put significant pressure on many companies 
46yc0308 The government civil suit alleged that a defect could cause the rear brakes to lock sending the car spinning out of control 
46yc0309 G\. M\. which no longer makes X\. cars denied that the brakes are defective 
46yc030a Agreeing with G\. M\. Judge Jackson ruled that the government came to court with nothing more essentially than a reasonable suspicion that a defect existed 
46yc030b The suit which also names the company\'s directors as defendants says the directors have given personal gain a priority over the interests of public shareholders 
46yc030c A second suit by Moshe J\. Schwartz Jeffrey Abrams Stanley Heineman and James T\. Cain . contains comparable charges 
46yc030d Earlier at least two of those same plaintiffs filed a suit over the Antar stock sales 
46yc030e A loss wasn\'t expected given Continental\'s operational difficulties that developed in the quarter 
46yc030f However the results of Texas Air\'s subsidiaries are the reverse of what many analysts had predicted earlier in the year 
46yc030g Instead of a modest profit at low cost Continental by the second quarter the newly expanded unit has struggled with losses 
46yc030h Its higher cost sister Eastern Airlines has shown signs of financial progress despite continuing confrontations with its employee unions 
46yc030i Mr\. Lay said the losses occured in late September and early this month [loud_breath] a time of particular volatility in oil markets 
46yc030j There were two senior people colluding and keeping a separate set of books apart from the official books for a few weeks Mr\. Lay said 
46yc030k Their guesses were wrong on both sides of the market 
46yc030l An F\. T\. C\. spokesman declined to comment 
46yc030m The investigation was first reported in F\. T\. C\. Watch a publication about regulatory matters 
46yc030n Reached in New York last night Mr\. Trump confirmed that the F\. T\. C\. had made the request 
46yc030o He declined to elaborate 
46yc030p Separately Wall Street speculation grew that media investor Rupert Murdoch was considering acquiring a stake in London based W\. P\. P\. 
46yc030q A Murdoch aide said that Mr\. Murdoch has been looking for a long time at the company 
46yc030r But a W\. P\. P\. spokesman said that there has been no contact and there has been no acquisition of W\. P\. P\. shares by Murdoch 
46yc030s Yesterday people close to Federated\'s board said that the company was still open to yet another friendly merger proposal from Campeau 
46yc030t If they\'ve got something to show us we\'ll take a look at it 
46yc030u They know where to find us said one source 
46yc030v We\'re not stonewalling them 
46yc030w I can\'t guarantee our group is one hundred \%PERCENT solid said an official at Suez a French holding company 
46yc030x I can\'t tell you that at those prices there won\'t be any reneging on agreements signed by the consortium\'s members 
46yc030y But he added such action could lead to legal reprisals 
46yc030z Both sides have worked hard and some progress has been realized in a number of areas s:aid Messrs\. 
46yc0310 Shultz and Shevardnadze in a joint statement last night 
46yc0311 But much more needs to be done 
46yc0312 The United Nations whose garbage bill is forty two thousand dollars a month is served by National Carting Company which won the pickup rights eight years ago 
46yc0313 Last December the U\. N\. didn\'t attempt to solicit bids 
46yc0314 It simply extended its contract with National Carting 
46yc0315 Soliciting bids in this particular industry is not the way to go a U\. N\. spokesman says implying that it is futile 
46yc0316 But critics charged that the collar actually added to volatility by making it more difficult for index arbitragers to do their business 
46yc0317 Many traders argue that such arbitrage has the effect of smoothing out volatility in the markets 
46yc0318 Index arbitragers buy and sell large amounts of stocks and stock index futures to take advantage of brief price disparities between the two related instruments 
46yc0319 The scene the Annual Norman Mailer Cocktail Party and Fist Fight 
46yc031a Candice Bergen and Woody Allen had just joined a group of pseudo intellectuals and were rambling with the best of them 
46yc031b I often think observed Ms\. Bergen that if Dostoevski had been a singer he\'d have sounded like Ray Charles 
46yc031c The other non winners most notably Exxon . were in many ways as noteworthy as the winners [footsteps] 
46yc031d It is believed that Exxon was outbid for several reserve packages leaving it with a lot of cash that could still be earmarked for acquisitions 
46yc031e At the Houston Petroleum Club industry officials couldn\'t eat lunch of late without discussing speculation that Exxon was going to walk away with all of the Tenneco properties 
46yc031f An Exxon spokeswoman said it was company policy not to comment on anything to do with acquisitions 
46yc0401 Also selling well was a fifty million dollar issue of revenue bonds by the Florida Department of Natural Resources 
46yc0402 The unsold balance was about ten \.POINT three million dollars 
46yc0403 The bonds were priced after auction to yield from four \.POINT two \%PERCENT in nineteen eighty eight to seven \.POINT two \%PERCENT in twenty twelve 
46yc0404 Moody\'s rated the bonds single A\. while S\. and P\. rated them single A\. minus 
46yc0405 Goldman Sachs and Company was [<misc_noise] the lead underwriter 
46yc0406 Still he would have preferred there to be no bids at all 
46yc0407 [misc_noise] The company\'s policy for eighty five years has been to be independent and grow and we have succeeded he says 
46yc0408 We are evaluating the offers for the company and for the shareholders but we profoundly regret the situation 
46yc0409 So strange is the situation that one Holly director has proposed changing the company\'s name to Fantasy Sugar Company 
46yc040a He says that could entice Shamrock because of its Disney connection to buy the company 
46yc040b Just think of how much they could make on the movie rights he adds 
46yc040c During the past several days corporations and other big investors have refrained from lending Treasury bonds and notes to securities dealers for brief periods 
46yc040d That in turn has forced many dealers to refrain from selling borrowed securities or amassing so called short positions 
46yc040e It\'s hard to short anything in this market at the moment said a trader at a large government securities dealer 
46yc040f Mr\. Antoniu denies any wrongdoing 
46yc040g I don\'t have anything to worry about the former investment banker says 
46yc040h I have always followed the advice of my lawyer and accountants 
46yc040i He says that he has cooperated in an inquiry by Florida officials but that he isn\'t aware the matter has been referred to the attorney general\'s office 
46yc040j In any case he says Sport About\'s problems will be cured by the public offering and are commonplace in any rapidly growing franchise business 
46yc040k Where can we find some clues to the answer or at least a possible answer to this question 
46yc040l I would suggest that we look at the one Marxist Leninist state that already has gone quite far down the revisionist road 
46yc040m I refer to the curiously neglected instance of Yugoslavia 
46yc040n Outside of the congressional leadership patience is wearing thin on pork barreling continuing resolutions 
46yc040o There are even congressmen who say they want to pass separate budget bills this year 
46yc040p We\'ll see 
46yc040q What seems more likely is that either a President or the courts or both someday will have to rescue the veto by forcing Congress to give up its arrogant ways 
46yc040r [loud_breath] So far we\'ve found that federal employees have dealt with this issue with a great deal of sensitivity and common sense Mrs\. Horner said 
46yc040s But there\'s a need for clarity 
46yc040t These guidelines will serve as reassurance to our managers 
46yc040u Senator Bentsen\'s corporate tax proposal would replace a provision in the committee bill allowing the Internal Revenue Service to withhold refunds from taxpayers who have defaulted on government loans 
46yc040v This provision won\'t raise any money in the current fiscal year and Senator Bentsen wanted something that would allow a quicker end to the diesel tax collection 
46yc040w The Texas Democrat plans to offer his substitution when the tax package reaches the Senate floor 
46yc040x Makers world wide have been racing to develop compact disk recorders 
46yc040y Many big Japanese stereo makers including names like Sanyo and Sony have been working for years to develop something akin to Tandy\'s new technology 
46yc040z Like Tandy\'s those machines are about two years away analysts say 
46yc0410 Compact disk recorders that store computer data rather than sound are expected out this year 
46yc0411 Union Pacific Corporation has rolled two club cars into town to entertain Democrats 
46yc0412 The company is headed by Drew Lewis frequently a troubleshooter for the Republicans 
46yc0413 The National Association of Realtors is throwing several parties and proudly boasts that eighty nine of its members are delegates or alternates to this convention 
46yc0414 Discussion of this subject better described as brooding about it is filled with misconceptions 
46yc0415 One of these is the great concern with the U\. S\. having become a net debtor 
46yc0416 What is meant by that is that Americans apparently own fewer assets abroad than foreigners own in the U\. S\. 
46yc0417 Many people have pointed out that these calculations are spurious because the assets are not all valued on the same basis 
46yc0418 If all assets were valued at today\'s prices the net debt of the U\. S\. would certainly be much smaller than it now appears and might be a net asset 
46yc0419 Investors taking part in the financing will lend Venezuela one billion dollars in exchange for monthly payments from the New York trust fund 
46yc041a Those payments will be sent when the financing is completed which is expected in mid December 
46yc041b The interest rate will be based on the five year U\. S\. Treasury bond rate plus a still undecided interest rate margin the Venezuelan official said 
46yc041c Investors continue to flock to the more conservative stock portfolios 
46yc041d Growth and income funds which combine hefty dividends with the goal of capital appreciation lead all other stock fund categories in sales for June 
46yc041e Among bond funds long term municipal funds captured the top spot 
46zc0201 I\'m very nervous because my view on rates is so close to the consensus . Edward Hyman [loud_breath] of Cyrus J\. Lawrence Incorporated says 
46zc0202 Remember the consensus usually is wrong 
46zc0203 The markets seem determined to make as many economists look as stupid as they possibly can 
46zc0204 I was startled . startled isn\'t the word reacted Alvin Novick a biology professor at Yale University 
46zc0205 [lip_smack] He warned that forced testing such as contemplated by the centers would drive homosexuals underground and away from cooperation with public health programs 
46zc0206 Rational people won\'t cooperate in ruining their own lives he said 
46zc0207 [loud_breath] Local newspapers yesterday said the government may qualify the decision to sign the restructuring agreement 
46zc0208 But official sources said the signing is likely to take place during the last week in September 
46zc0209 The signing deadline is October one 
46zc020a Other toy makers such as Mattel Incorporated . have been bringing out new products early in the year to increase sales at times other than Christmas 
46zc020b But Tyco\'s day after Christmas launch is unusual 
46zc020c The toy business is ripe for some marketing innovation after two years of relatively flat sales says Rick . Anguilla . editor of the Toy and Hobby World magazine 
46zc020d If Tyco succeeds others will certainly follow 
46zc020e [lip_smack] No one seems quite sure how the publisher juggles his assets among his various companies . which include the publicly owned Maxwell Communication Corporation . and various private ones 
46zc020f Control of the public company and of private interests like Mirror Group Newspapers Limited rests with a foundation in Liechtenstein . Pergamon Holding Foundation . about which little is disclosed 
46zc020g He says its beneficiaries are charities which he promises to identify someday soon 
46zc020h The Bank of Italy also reportedly sold marks to buy Italian lire 
46zc020i The transactions may have been directed mainly at defending the sagging lira in the European Monetary System . in which eight European currencies float within specified limits 
46zc020j But they also had the effect of helping the dollar by increasing the supply of marks in the market 
46zc020k For Environmental Treatment . which like Mr\. Kirk relishes . an extremely low profile . the oil spill has brought a wave of attention 
46zc020l In fact when Wall Street learned that the publicly held company was hired to handle the multimillion dollar cleanup . the concern\'s stock shot up almost ten \%PERCENT 
46zc020m [tongue_click] Yesterday . in New York Stock Exchange composite trading its stock closed at twelve dollars . down twenty five cents 
46zc020n State workers are another constituency 
46zc020o [tongue_click] One in four working Panamanians . owes its livelihood to the government . and the general expects help from all of them 
46zc020p Down the street from Mr\. Sanchez\'s shop . Carlos a government mechanic says he goes to many pro Noriega demonstrations 
46zc020q The impact will be enormous 
46zc020r The Republicans\' strongest case against the Democratic nominee . h- his naivete on national security interests . will disappear 
46zc020s [loud_breath] The suspicion of a selection based entirely on political instead of substantive grounds will be undercut 
46zc020t And a message that the current vice president is largely irrelevant . will be strongly delivered 
46zc020u [tongue_click] Mr\. Tucker\'s hard hitting campaign has in turn appalled top union leaders who say he has tarnished their reputation as one of the . labor movement\'s cleanest organizations 
46zc020v The statements of an undemocratic union being in bed with management . hurt this union . said Mr\. Bieber 
46zc020w I resent those statements 
46zc020x Mr\. Delchamps said thirty \%PERCENT of the company\'s stock outstanding is held by people who have agreed not to sell their holdings before October thirty one 
46zc020y Another twenty five \%PERCENT is held under the company\'s employee stock ownership plan 
46zc020z Most of the people in the former category are expected to extend the no sell agreement for another year he said 
46zc0210 O\. T\. C\. brokers also stress that their stocks often outperform listed ones on a long term basis 
46zc0211 And overall the Nasdaq Composite Index is up thirteen \%PERCENT this year . twice as much as the Dow Jones Industrial Average 
46zc0212 [tongue_click] Also they note the tiny stocks that generally trade under three dollars a share . have always taken big percentage moves up or down when they move at all 
46zc0213 [tongue_click] These mixed feelings of frustration with and gratitude toward the authorities are part of the everyday life of a foreigner doing business in Korea 
46zc0214 In fact . such contradictions are what seem to make the Korean world go round 
46zc0215 [tongue_click] A Western businessman needs to be ready for them 
46zc0216 Here are a few . hard learned facts of Korean business life 
46zc0217 There are also broker finders that get fees merely for matching . borrowers and lenders of stock 
46zc0218 Broker finders can also include the brokerage firms themselves 
46zc0219 The government . is investigating whether all the payments that fly to and from such broker finders are legitimate 
46zc021a [tongue_click] We are extremely selective . said Paul Suckow . director of fixed income . at Oppenheimer Management Corporation 
46zc021b [tongue_click] I don\'t think some issues are going to make it he said 
46zc021c Even cautious managers such as Mr\. Suckow [tongue_click] are seeing the impact of the . Campeau debacle 
46zc021d He said his firm owns a small amount of the Federated senior debt 
46zc021e Although the bonds are secured by bank credits . they have also fallen in price recently 
46zc0301 The computer also can display a pattern showing how people normally place the tongue . to produce say an s\. sound 
46zc0302 A deaf person can then try to match the pattern by placing the tongue against the electronic palate 
46zc0303 [tongue_click] With careful coaching and trial and error . children like . Miss Gilroy can learn how to make sounds that require placing the tongue against the roof of the mouth 
46zc0304 The trash 
46zc0305 Proofs of purchase and sales receipts that had been turned in for consumer product rebates . and already paid 
46zc0306 The women resubmitted thousands of the rebates and camouflaged their trail by varying their names and using postal boxes all over the country 
46zc0307 [tongue_click] [loud_breath] Roadrunner Enterprises Inc\. sold one million two hundred and fifty thousand common shares at . ten dollars and twenty five cents each . Alex 
46zc0308 Brown and Sons Inc\. . lead underwriter said

46zc030c [tongue_click] Within two hours . Dayton Hudson common hit fifty nine dollars a share on the Big Board and up to sixty three dollars in other markets 
46zc030d People took positions in the stock simply on the rumor of a takeover by someone no one had ever heard of 
46zc030e Some of the full time risk takers don\'t even need public announcements to plunge 
46zc030f Nor do they require inside information a la Ivan Boesky . who was venal . but not insane 
46zc030g The people who invested in Dayton Hudson . however were mad 
46zc030h Someone dangled a *fantasy* in front of these supposedly savvy guys and they went for it like trout to the fly 
46zc030i [tongue_click] Selling the Canadian business will help T\. L\. C\. Group complete its financing on the rest of the Beatrice international operations 
46zc030j T\. L\. C\. Group said yesterday that it has a firm commitment from Drexel Burnham Lambert Incorporated its investment banker . to finance its acquisition 
46zc030k A Drexel spokesman said he expects the financing to come through a combination of bank loans and high yield bonds 
46zc030l [tongue_click] Drexel financed the Kohlberg Kravis buy out of Beatrice last year 
46zc030m Mr\. Lay said the losses occured in late September and early this month . [other_mouth_sound] a time of particular volatility in oil markets 
46zc030n There were two senior people colliding and keeping a separate set of books apart from the official books for a few weeks Mr\. Lay said 
46zc030o Their guesses were wrong on both sides of the market 
46zc030p In a statement . Timeplex says its directors voted to postpone the annual meeting . which was scheduled for yesterday 
46zc030q A new date hasn\'t been set 
46zc030r A Unisys spokesman said the companies hope to complete the acquisition . which requires Timeplex holders\' approval and government clearance . in about four months 
46zc030s At the meeting . shareholders approved an increase in authorized common shares to twenty million . from fifteen million 
46zc030t The additional shares may be used for benefit plans . to obtain additional financing or to make acquisitions 
46zc030u The company has about ten \.POINT eight million common shares outstanding 
46zc030v The U\. S\. of course has a vast and in many places . efficient infrastructure 
46zc030w [tongue_click] The council study put a value of . one trillion dollars on the parts it measured 
46zc030x But government owned fixed capital suffers along with privately owned plant and equipment when economic policies discourage long term investment 
46zc030y [tongue_click] The greatest scour:ge of investment is of course inflation . which explains why the national infrastructure suffered particularly during the nineteen seventies 
46zc030z [tongue_click] [loud_breath] User fees simply could not keep up with the soaring costs of loans and construction 
46zc0310 Highway construction had the added problem of reduced yields from gasoline taxes brought about by energy shortages and shortage enforced conservation 
46zc0311 The measure was a bold move for a president who has come to view inertia . as the best form of security 
46zc0312 The suspension effectively will slash salaries and cut an estimated . eight \.POINT three billion dollars from federal spending this year 
46zc0313 [tongue_click] The aim is to hold the budget deficit to . four \.POINT nine \%PERCENT of economic output . down from a projected seven \%PERCENT 
46zc0314 This it is hoped . will help stop high inflation from spiraling into . hyperinflation 
46zc0315 The think tank measured expense ratios . which are a fund\'s operating costs as a percentage of assets 
46zc0316 For investors . high ratios are clearly of concern 
46zc0317 It *cuts* into potential return . even when a fund is doing well 
46zc0318 And it leaves a fund with less of a cushion . in case performance sours 
46zc0319 Almost unnoticed in discussions of the procurement scandal is the fact that this elaborate indeed tortuous system seems to have worked . at least on its own terms 
46zc031a Nobody was able to throw a contract directly 
46zc031b Instead . what some contractors seem to have done is to buy inside information . that would allow them to prepare a better proposal 
46zc031c [tongue_click] Nine month results . also include a twelve million dollar net loss from the disposition of trucking operations 
46zc031d About eight million of the trucking charge was taken in the third quarter 
46zc031e Year earlier results were restated [door_slam/] for accounting [/door_slam] changes 
46zc031f [tongue_click] N\. E\. C\. Corp\. . as one example began donating money to M\. I\. T\. . in the nineteen seventies 
46zc031g One donation of one million dollars went to create a . C\. and C\. software professorship 
46zc031h [tongue_click] C\. and C\. is the N\. E\. C\. corporate slogan . it stands for computers and communications 
46zc0401 The big problem is that Doctor Thanos can no longer use so called passive losses from these properties to offset his salary or earned income 
46zc0402 The disallowance of passive losses is being phased in over five years 
46zc0403 Real estate depreciation schedules also have been lengthened . reducing their value 
46zc0404 While the U\. S\. focuses on the Iran Contra hearings . more Soviet arms flow into Nicaragua 
46zc0405 More than . three hundred million dollars worth of weapons were delivered to the Sandinistas in the first half of this year according to U\. S\. intelligence 
46zc0406 [tongue_click] That\'s about nine times the direct U\. S\. military aid . provided to the Contras in that period 
46zc0407 The Soviet equipment is just pouring in . one ranking Pentagon official told the A\. P\. 
46zc0408 The Nicaraguans are consolidating their military buildup and adding to it everything imaginable 
46zc0409 Art collectors and dealers . heaved a sigh of relief last night 
46zc040a After high prices and frantic bidding at art auctions last spring . about one in four works didn\'t sell at a contemporary art auction at Christie\'s 
46zc040b But at least the market didn\'t crash 
46zc040c Citicorp\'s loss for the year stemmed from a three billion dollar . addition in the second quarter to loss reserves for loans to developing countries 
46zc040d Excluding one time gains and losses Citicorp\'s nineteen eighty seven profit would have been . one \.POINT one five billion dollars 
46zc040e Excluded are gains on real estate in the fourth quarter and pension assets in the third quarter . plus the effect of the reserve addition 
46zc040f Some reporters were more original 
46zc040g [tongue_click] A pair from a local paper asked Edsel if he favored casino gambling in Detroit . a concept heavily promoted by Mayor Coleman Young 
46zc040h The strangest inquiry lobbed at Bill was What role I saw at Ford for my daughters . who are two years old and two months old 
46zc040i I thought that was kind of putting the cart before the horse . [loud_breath] I want to get them out of kindergarten first 
46zc040j And what if the foundry can\'t keep up with Cummins\'s demands 
46zc040k [tongue_click] Mr\. Peterson says the engine company has backup suppliers 
46zc040l But he adds that backup is all offshore

471c030y Oh no a man in the middle of the theater gasped breaking the silence 
471c030z A few people giggled nervously you could tell they\'d been thinking the same thing themselves 
471c0310 Then more silence interrupted again later by a round of communal sobbing 
471c0311 Meanwhile Audi set up a bonus plan to encourage dealership salespeople to sell Audi eighty and ninety cars newer models that carry far less generous incentives 
471c0312 Under the bonus plan Audi promised to give sales people two hundred and fifty dollars every time they sold an eighty or a ninety model 
471c0313 [tongue_click] Law officials from the Federal Trade Commission and several states have said they are opening inquiries into Audi\'s rebates 
471c0314 During any repair process blood clots are constantly being formed and dissolved 
471c0315 It is quite possible scientists speculate that during attempts to repair the *artery* wall the body at some point tries to dissolve a blood clot 
471c0316 But it mistakenly grabs protein A\. instead of plasminogen pulling it with its bag of fat and cholesterol into the *artery* wall 
471c0317 [tongue_click] This thwarts the repair process and begins a vicious cycle drawing more and more cholesterol into the damaged area 
471c0318 And in fact microscopic blood clots and bits of L\. P\. A\. are found in the mishmash of the deposits 
471c0319 Many traders assume the financing will consist of three year notes ten year notes and thirty year bonds 
471c031a But some traders say they aren\'t so sure there will be any thirty year bonds 
471c031b The reason President Reagan hasn\'t yet signed a tax bill with a provision that would increase the goverment\'s long term bond issuance authority 
471c031c The existing benchmark thirty year bonds ended one and three eighths lower or down thirteen dollars and seventy five cents for each one thousand dollar face amount 
471c031d [tongue_click] The issue\'s yield which moves in the opposite direction from its price was quoted late at eight \.POINT one five \%PERCENT 
471c031e The price on the long term bond was quoted at about one hundred and seven thirty thirty twos [sigh] 
471c031f The new ten year notes were quoted in when issued trading at about ninety nine fourteen thirty twos to yield eight \.POINT zero six five \%PERCENT 
471c0401 As expected the budget will include a number of proposals that were unsuccessful last year including the sale of Naval Petroleum Reserve and the Boo:nville Power Administration 
471c0402 Some administration and congressional aides think Congress will go along with selling the petroleum reserve this year 
471c0403 But resistance to the Boonville idea was so strong that lawmakers passed a resolution prohibiting the administration from spending any federal money to study it 
471c0404 Such results are causing some Wall Street professionals to take the January indicator less seriously than they used to 
471c0405 I\'m putting less emphasis on some of these traditional barometers says Eugene Peroni director of technical research for Janney Montgomery Scott Incorporated in Philadelphia 
471c0406 [tongue_click] They are not the most scientific things around 
471c0407 [tongue_click] Banks and insurance companies are likely to have the highest salary increases this year at about six \%PERCENT Mr\. Peck said 
471c0408 [tongue_click] Manufacturing and construction companies will be the lowest at about five \%PERCENT he added 
471c0409 [tongue_click] Mr\. Peck said the survey didn\'t cover Wall Street brokerage houses where salaries and bonuses have soared in recent years 
471c040a They would have blown us off the charts he said 
471c040b [tongue_click] I am positive on the move to his new post Mr\. Rhines said 
471c040c I grew up in the semiconductor group 
471c040d [tongue_click] Mr\. Rhines held a number of positions in the company\'s semiconductor operations before taking the data systems job in early nineteen eighty five 
471c040e [tongue_click] It is due to education he says blowing smoke 
471c040f We give young people compositions to write pictures to draw 
471c040g People have come to see that it is not a good thing to drink too much 
471c040h There are clear limits to glasnost 
471c040i Some relaxation of controls over religious expression is evident but not much 
471c040j Radio Liberty quotes a Gorbachev speech to Uzbek party leaders warning against participation by party members in religious ceremonies 
471c040k He does not take a benign view of the rise of Islamic *fundamentalism* along Soviet borders 
471c040l Despite worries about investment bankers lending money for buyouts Morgan Stanley did better than Owens Illinois\' public bondholders will do 
471c040m Annualized it earned eighty \%PERCENT pre tax on its three month three hundred million dollar loan to Owens Illinois Mr\. Niehaus says 
471c040n That includes interest of ten million dollars and investment banking fees of fifty million dollars 
471c040o To do the job S\. C\. I\. has assembled what analysts call a crack management team 
471c040p President Eugene Sapp runs the company on a day to day basis and he does so in a no frills atmosphere 
471c040q For example company cars planes and country club memberships are taboo 
471c040r Mr\. Icahn couldn\'t be reached for comment and it was unclear what intentions he might *ultimately* harbor toward Tenneco 
471c040s His position in the company is understood to be one of more than twenty similar s:takes he has amassed in a variety of concerns 
471c040t As previously reported he also controls an eleven \.POINT four \%PERCENT stake in the U\. S\. X\. Corp a Pittsburgh based oil and steel concern 
471c040u [tongue_click] Republicans cannot expect to change black voting patterns overnight especially considering the filter of myth and false accusation they will have to send their message through 
471c040v But they can do much better than they\'ve done if they\'re willing to make the effort Clarence Thomas and other black Republicans describe 
471c040w A good place to start is the nineteen eighty eight campaign 
471c040x With Europe having made concessions to the U\. S\. Mr\. Baker and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan could come under increasing pressure to help stem the dollar\'s recent fall 
471c040y For weeks the U\. S\. currency has been plummeting 
471c040z [tongue_click] Rather than raise interest rates to support the currency the Fed has focused on maintaining ample *liquidity* to fend off a recession following the stock market crash 
471c0410 Takeover targets turned in a mixed performance 
471c0411 Firestone was up one and one half to sixty three and one eighth after it disclosed that it was exploring various options in response to Pirelli Group\'s takeover bid 
471c0412 The options include discussions with Japan\'s Bridgestone to determine what course Bridgestone might pursue 
471c0413 Firestone said that because of the Pirelli offer it\'s unlikely to complete the proposed sale of seventy five \%PERCENT of its tire making and wholesaling operations to Bridgestone 
471c0414 The whole environment has changed he said 
471c0415 We have a lot more options than we did before 
471c0416 He\'s planning on spending seven million dollars on advertising and promotion this year compared with a couple of million dollars in the past 
471c0417 Condom sales for the entire industry were up twenty seven \%PERCENT for the twelve months ended in April 
471c0418 Carter Wallace\'s share amounts to over fifty \%PERCENT of the total market 
471c0419 Helped by Wednesday\'s Wall Street rally and improved commodity prices stock prices posted robust gains in Sydney 
471c041a Turnover remained thin 
471c041b An early spurt of domestic led demand drove prices to their best levels during the first hour of activity 
471c041c They drifted for the remainder of the session and closed just short of their peaks 
471c041d To cope in the early going the tall lean Mr\. Hauptfuhrer can draw on solid experience employee loyalty and considerable investor support 
471c041e He was a principal architect of Sun\'s big exploratory drilling and production push in the early nineteen eighties 
471c041f Aides and former colleagues praise his tenacity financial acumen and capacity for assimilating details 
472c0201 The federal funds rate or rate on reserves that banks lend each other overnight hovered around six and a half \%PERCENT much of the day 
472c0202 [tongue_click] That was up from Friday\'s average of six \.POINT twenty two \%PERCENT 
472c0203 [tongue_click] The increase came even though the Federal Reserve injected funds into the banking system by buying securities from dealers who agreed to buy them back next Monday 
472c0204 [tongue_click] Seoul\'s rush to build creates snafus 
472c0205 A national museum burns only days before its dedication [loud_breath] due to faulty wiring 
472c0206 Tourist signs are posted too high to read 
472c0207 [tongue_click] The new subway runs two \.POINT three eight billion dollars in debt because ridership is fifty \%PERCENT below estimates 
472c0208 The altered memo however never mentioned the president 
472c0209 Instead it recommended only that \"QUOTE the current donors be approached to provide fifteen to twenty million dollars additional \"END-OF-QUOTE 
472c020a At the time Saudi Arabia already had contributed thirty two million dollars to the Contras 
472c020b If Representative Jenkins played down his appointment on the panel Senator Trible was quick to seize it as an opportunity 
472c020c [tongue_click] The son of a corporate executive Senator Trible forty is a young man still on the move 
472c020d [tongue_click] [loud_breath] The challenge for any first term senator is to be seen and heard [loud_breath] he says of his committee assignment 
472c020e [tongue_click] This gives me the opportunity to do both 
472c020f L\. T\. V\. has said repeatedly since its filing that it would fight any creditor move to either reorganize the unit separately or force its sale 
472c020g [tongue_click] Creditors on the other hand [loud_breath] have discussed the idea almost since the day of L\. T\. V\.\'s filing 
472c020h [tongue_click] And the pension agency the banks and the committee representing unsecured creditors have recently been holding serious discussions on the issue 
472c020i A source close to Texaco said that while Texaco is anxious to emerge from Chapter eleven [loud_breath] it isn\'t in the company\'s or shareholders\' interest [loud_breath] to rush into a settlement 
472c020j [tongue_click] [loud_breath] It\'s normal for creditors to want a quick settlement 
472c020k [tongue_click] But Texaco\'s shareholders have a big say in this case and they aren\'t pushing for a settlement for settlement\'s sake the source said 
472c020l [tongue_click] Separately Pacific Lighting completed the previously reported sale of its land development subsidiaries [loud_breath] to two investment groups for three hundred and twenty five million dollars 
472c020m The sale will result in a fourth quarter gain of about twelve million dollars [loud_breath] or twenty cents a share 
472c020n [tongue_click] The company earlier had said it had expected to post the gain for the third quarter 
472c020o [tongue_click] Edgar S\. Woolard Du Pont\'s president and chief operating officer [loud_breath] nurtured the establishment of the venture 
472c020p [tongue_click] He says Du Pont is still very optimistic [loud_breath] about its prospects [loud_breath] but he acknowledges hurdles that must be overcome 
472c020q [tongue_click] The real challenge he says [loud_breath] is whether Philips Du Pont Optical [loud_breath] can get there and stay ahead 
472c020r For a ship or missile guided by the wrong time signal [loud_breath] that little gap could mean arriving at the wrong destination 
472c020s [tongue_click] If we let the difference grow says Mr\. McCarthy we could run into problems over thousands of years 
472c020t It might be noon by atomic time but dark outside 
472c020u As soon as two months from now Argentine courts are due to try the last group of generals still subject to prosecution for alleged human rights abuses 
472c020v [tongue_click] The proceedings are the last chance to bring military men to civilian justice 
472c020w [tongue_click] So far in four years of civilian government seven top military officials have been convicted 
472c020x [tongue_click] Charges were brought against hundreds of others but prosecutions were halted last year in the face of army restiveness 
472c020y The argument was that the accused officers had only been acting under orders 
472c020z Mrs\. Bates for one is no fan of hypnosis 
472c0210 [tongue_click] I think you can get motivated without all this violence she says 
472c0211 When Mr\. Siegel started leaving violent messages on the family answering machine last year she saw her opening 
472c0212 She erased them 
472c0213 Groff wouldn\'t identify the potential bidders and said no firm offers have been made 
472c0214 The maker of aluminum products said it hired Thomson McKinnon Securities Incorporated [loud_breath] to help assess its options and advise it on any bids that might materialize 
472c0215 The review may result in the sale of the company to another entity Groff said 
472c0216 As previously reported Warner and Lorimar agreed in May to merge in a stock swap valued at about six hundred and forty million dollars 
472c0217 [tongue_click] Chris Craft Industries Incorporated Warner\'s largest shareholder has filed suit to delay the merger charging that it violates Chris Craft\'s shareholder agreement with Warner 
472c0218 [tongue_click] Nevertheless Warner has said it plans to proceed with the merger anyway 
472c0219 [tongue_click] In Connecticut\'s Senate race traditional politics is turned upside down 
472c021a It is hardly any wonder that twenty five \%PERCENT of the likely voters in the state are undecided another word for confused 
472c021b Setting the undecided voters aside the contest is close with the latest Hartford Courant Connecticut poll showing the two candidates neck and neck 
472c021c [tongue_click] Mr\. Lieberman\'s supporters are sporting buttons that read Dead Heat 
472c021d Investors continue to flock to the more conservative stock portfolios 
472c021e [tongue_click] Growth and income funds which combine hefty dividends with the goal of capital appreciation led all other stock fund categories in sales for June 
472c021f [tongue_click] Among bond funds long term municipal funds captured the top spot 
472c0301 Mr\. Henkel a former Atlanta attorney was appointed to the three member Bank Board by President Reagan November seventh 
472c0302 He has put all his business interests that had transactions with thrifts including those with loans from Lincoln into a blind trust 
472c0303 [tongue_click] He has also said he intends to recuse himself from Bank Board votes specifically involving thrifts he has dealt with including Lincoln 
472c0304 [tongue_click] The mining was a classic example of covert activity [loud_breath] advancing national security goals secretly 
472c0305 [tongue_click] The Corinto mining had a sensible U\. S\. security objective curtailing the shipment of Soviet bloc arms to Central America through the communist government of Nicaragua 
472c0306 The existence of the operation leaked out and once exposed details flowed freely from Congress 
472c0307 [tongue_click] The activity ended 
472c0308 This example is not unique 
472c0309 [tongue_click] Opponents of covert activity have discovered that by leaking covert operations into the news [loud_breath] they can create a *debilitating* aura of suspicion and illegitimacy around [loud_breath] foreign policies they dislike 
472c030a [tongue_click] The companies\' sharply improved results provided more evidence of a rebound [loud_breath] in both the chip and personal computer industries 
472c030b [tongue_click] The results follow a report last week from the Semiconductor Industry Association [loud_breath] that the beleaguered chip industry is experiencing an upturn 
472c030c In March the industry\'s leading indicator reached the highest level since nineteen eighty four 
472c030d [tongue_click] I\. R\. E\. has downsized its real estate syndication business and is primarily a savings and loan holding company [loud_breath] Mr\. Levan said 
472c030e Earnings in the past were somewhat erratic quarter to quarter because the major business was real estate syndication 
472c030f [tongue_click] Now the S\. and L\. holding company is the main business with down sized real estate syndication 
472c030g Core earnings are very consistent 
472c030h [tongue_click] Since the presidential and congressional campaigns will dominate national attention next year [loud_breath] there will be relatively little focus on state races 
472c030i [tongue_click] Partly to avoid overtly inserting presidential politics into state politics [loud_breath] many states have changed the date of their statehouse elections to off years 
472c030j [tongue_click] As a result only twelve of the fifty states few of them large are electing governors next year 
472c030k Lincoln has about two million common shares outstanding 
472c030l Yesterday in composite trading on the American Stock Exchange [loud_breath] Lincoln closed at eleven \.POINT one two five dollars a share up twelve and a half cents 
472c030m [tongue_click] Based on that price Lincoln\'s common shares have a total market value of about twenty two \.POINT two million dollars 
472c030n The New York Stock Exchange proposal would place tighter controls on the exchange\'s [loud_breath] automated order execution computer system called SuperDot which is central to most program trading 
472c030o [tongue_click] A second proposal said to be before the board would eliminate all program trading using the SuperDot system 
472c030p But that proposal is given a smaller chance of passing the board the sources said 
472c030q But Senator David Boren Democrat of Oklahoma the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee was less optimistic 
472c030r [tongue_click] This is no way to begin a relationship under a treaty as important as this [loud_breath] if these deliberate ambiguities remain he told reporters 
472c030s Senator Cohen also said he is less optimistic that the U\. S\. Soviet differences can be resolved quickly 
472c030t [tongue_click] One of the more direct readings on inflation will come in Friday\'s report on consumer prices [loud_breath] which are expected not surprisingly to be higher 
472c030u Analysts expect an increase of about \.POINT four \%PERCENT in the April consumer price index on the heels of a \.POINT five \%PERCENT jump the previous month 
472c030v [tongue_click] The price increases are expected pretty much across the board as commodities and services are rising at about a four \%PERCENT annual rate 
472c030w It has now been eleven nights since the arrest of Francis Seow former solicitor general and law society president in Singapore 
472c030x [tongue_click] While Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew\'s government has admitted holding Mr\. Seow it has kept him totally incommunicado 
472c030y [tongue_click] It has refused requests to see him from both his family and his lawyer 
472c030z T\. V\. Late Night with David Letterman mired in reruns since the writers\' strike began March seventh [loud_breath] may resume new shows by June eighth 
472c0310 [tongue_click] Mr\. Letterman the sardonic talk show host said in a statement he hopes to reach a separate contract agreement with the Writers Guild of America 
472c0311 The union is to vote today on whether to approve a number of separate agreements with independent producers [loud_breath] although a spokesman said the Letterman show isn\'t one of them 
472c0312 [tongue_click] F\. P\. L\. said the acquisition would be accounted for as a pooling of interests 
472c0313 Turner owns about twelve thousand acres in southwest Florida ten thousand of which are citrus groves 
472c0314 [tongue_click] F\. P\. L\. said the acquisition increases its citrus acreage to twenty two thousand 
472c0315 Frankfurt share prices closed mostly lower in moderately active trading Friday [loud_breath] as an early rally fizzled amid position squaring [loud_breath] before the weekend and uncertainty about the lower dollar 
472c0316 [tongue_click] The D\. A\. X\. index dropped five \.POINT four nine [loud_breath] to twelve eighty nine \.POINT seven two 
472c0317 [tongue_click] After opening broadly higher the tide turned at midday when the dollar\'s slide to a three month low began to worry market participants 
472c0318 [tongue_click] That fight while remarkable for its bitterness typifies the core problem in the nationwide push to contain medical cost Who gets less 
472c0319 [tongue_click] Doctors want to maintain their authority and their incomes 
472c031a [other_mouth_sound] Hospitals are fighting to hang onto revenue more than a third of which comes from Medicare 
472c031b [tongue_click] And patients don\'t want to see services decrease 
472c031c But the health care system now consumes about one million dollars a minute [loud_breath] and all agree it needs taming 
472c031d [tongue_click] Then in nineteen eighty four National Union joined the market 
472c031e [tongue_click] Its policy for state judges the biggest clients cost eight hundred dollars a year for a one million dollar policy with no deductible 
472c031f The judges are covered for acts errors or omissions in the performance of professional duties Mr\. Bolen says 
472c0401 A year earlier G\. M\. Hughes had first quarter profit of [loud_breath] a hundred and sixteen \.POINT two million dollars [loud_breath] or seventy seven cents a share 
472c0402 [tongue_click] Per share earnings for the nineteen eighty seven and nineteen eighty six quarters [loud_breath] benefited from thirty seven \.POINT two million dollars of good will [loud_breath] amortization in each period 
472c0403 The good will amortization represents the amount above book value that G\. M\. paid for Hughes Aircraft 
472c0404 That accounting adjustment represents a charge against G\. M\.\'s earnings 
472c0405 [tongue_click] Before Friday [loud_breath] it seemed that only an unexpected break in the Delaware court case could have extracted Henley from the dilemma it now faces 
472c0406 Thus the case was closely watched 
472c0407 But it also raised important issues of corporate law 
472c0408 [tongue_click] The most important of these was a contention that Santa Fe\'s board acted illegally last December [loud_breath] when it lowered the threshhold for a shareholder rights plan to twenty \%PERCENT 
472c0409 Previously the rights or poison pill were triggered automatically only if fifty \%PERCENT of the stock were in hostile hands 
472c040a [tongue_click] S\. D\. I\. despite what the Defense Luddites say [loud_breath] is not an adventure in technology application 
472c040b It is a tool of national policy [loud_breath] and as with any tool it is supposed to be used with a specific objective in mind 
472c040c [tongue_click] The objective lest we forget it is to prevent a global nuclear war 
472c040d [tongue_click] His inability to recover from October\'s market plunge was traced to a hostile bid from two rival [loud_breath] financiers for Bell Resources L\. T\. D\. which is controlled by Bell Group 
472c040e [tongue_click] The bid forced Mr\. Holmes a Court to call off [loud_breath] a proposed merger of the Bell companies 
472c040f That was the turning point said Darryl Smalley [loud_breath] a director at the Perth brokerage Hartley [loud_breath] Poynton L\. T\. D\. 
472c040g [tongue_click] Finally there\'s the welfare problem 
472c040h [tongue_click] Not all workers are as lucky as Joseph 
472c040i [tongue_click] Some get sick or injured and lose their jobs 
472c040j [tongue_click] Others who turned their life savings over to brokers in order to get here [loud_breath] discover that promises of money meals and lodging were bogus 
472c040k [tongue_click] Fear of deportation prevents them from going to the police for help 
472c040l There are *unconfirmed* reports of workers starving to death here 
472c040m [tongue_click] But some argue Agenda could be a big hit and create a new category of software 
472c040n This is fundamentally new and different 
472c040o [tongue_click] It\'s tremendously exciting says Esther Dyson editor of Release one \.POINT oh [loud_breath] a newsletter that covers computer software 
472c040p [tongue_click] I think it\'s an extremely useful tool says Mort Rosenthal [loud_breath] chairman of Corporate Software Incorporated [loud_breath] a Westwood Massachusetts based software distributor 
472c040q [tongue_click] He says he uses Agenda more than any other software 
472c040r Imperial says it has had terrific unsolicited interest in the material from all areas of plastics uses 
472c040s But the cost of manufacturing the natural plastic is prohibitively expensive fifteen dollars a pound compared with roughly sixty five cents a pound for conventional plastic 
472c040t [tongue_click] However the company says it hopes to reduce manufacturing costs enough to begin marketing the plastic in two to five years 
472c040u Mr\. Hefter of Jefferies says investors are basically picking some stocks in which they have situations going that they have a definite idea about 
472c040v But in general the wait and see attitude is still very prevalent out there 
472c040w [tongue_click] There is no real pressure to jump into the market right now 
472c040x Mr\. Bethell has an eye for the fashionable and for the abominable which today are often the same thing 
472c040y [tongue_click] He obviously relishes a good fight [loud_breath] and saying no to the cultural barbarians and the current wisdom 
472c040z He uses pig bladder hammer and tongs and scalpel and he is adept with them all as The Electric Windmill shows 
472c0410 [tongue_click] The big attraction is that the nineteen eighty eight Summer Olympics aren\'t really being held in the summer 
472c0411 G\. M\. which has lost about eight \%PERCENT of the U\. S\. car market in recent years figures the games\' late September timing is ideal 
472c0412 It also hopes the games will attract upscale viewers who normally don\'t tune into sports 
472c0413 During that campaign as in earlier ones [loud_breath] a few low and middle ranking officials were arrested or dismissed 
472c0414 But no leading cadres or their family members were punished [loud_breath] fueling cynicism among the masses 
472c0415 [tongue_click] And the corporation problem seemed only to get worse 
472c0416 Getting the deal right is the key 
472c0417 Unlike warrants on Japanese stocks deals for U\. S\. companies aren\'t really covered by the ownership of underlying shares 
472c0418 Instead underwriters use what they call a dynamic hedge 
472c0419 [tongue_click] Each is different but usually involves a combination of stock option purchases [loud_breath] arranged by the home office in New York 
472c041a [tongue_click] Some of that cash has been used for bonus payments 
472c041b [tongue_click] Wages and bonuses rose nineteen \%PERCENT in the first half [loud_breath] a rate that far outpaced economic growth and exerted upward pressure on prices 
472c041c China\'s economy grew at an annual rate of five \.POINT seven \%PERCENT in the first six months [loud_breath] roughly half the average annual rate in the past decade 
473c0201 Wickes had made its friendly offer for Lear Siegler to help its Santa Monica neighbor ward off A\. F\. G\. Partners\' initial takeover bid last month 
473c0202 But Wickes which had signed an agreement to acquire Lear for one \.POINT seven billion backed off after having problems arranging financing on satisfactory terms 
473c0203 Wickes has declined comment since saying that it was officially continuing efforts to arrange financing [loud_breath] but wasn\'t optimistic about its chances 
473c0204 The administration has occasionally mouthed complaints about the Private Express Statutes the laws that prohibit free choice in mail service but has done little aside from talk 
473c0205 [loud_breath] The White House intervened earlier last year to stop the Postal Service from banning private companies from shipping bundles of letters overseas to be deposited directly in foreign mail systems 
473c0206 But this was fairly minor 
473c0207 [loud_breath] The government civil suit alleged that a defect could cause the rear brakes to lock sending the car spinning out of control 
473c0208 G\. M\. which no longer makes X\. cars denied that the brakes are defective 
473c0209 Agreeing with G\. M\. Judge Jackson ruled that the government came to court with nothing more essentially than a reasonable suspicion that a defect existed 
473c020a By now there is little else Mr\. Falcigno can do to hype attendance 
473c020b That doesn\'t mean he doesn\'t have other worries 
473c020c Counterfeit tickets have been a problem although a new type of ticket with a special edge and weave seems to have provided a temporary solution

473c020o As a result the government is talking of higher farm prices 
473c020p But higher farm prices would add to an already steep inflation rate 
473c020q So Beijing officials reportedly talk of tying wages to inflation an idea reminiscent of the wage indexation tried in some Latin American nations several years ago with disastrous results

473c020w Money to promote a flagging global corporate computer service is becoming available 
473c020x So is support for a beefed up team of deal makers to broker mergers among California companies 
473c020y None of these areas however hold the prospect of quick growth 
473c020z So far the administration has ignored these appeals and so have Mr\. Reed and other bankers 
473c0210 It seems that the principles enunciated at the beginning of this decade by Messrs\. 
473c0211 Wriston and Theobald still prevail if not in lending the bank\'s money at least in suggesting . that other investors put up the cash 
473c0212 However conventional film will be marginally profitable at best for Polaroid because initially Polaroid won\'t be manufacturing the film contends Elliott Novak an industry consultant 
473c0213 Instead it will buy the film from another company and put its name on it just as it does with videotape 
473c0214 Since it began selling videotape a few years ago Polaroid has built up an impressive twelve \%PERCENT market share making it the leader in the U\. S\. 
473c0215 But fierce competition has kept videotape profits slim and the conventional film business isn\'t likely to prove any bonanza either 
473c0216 Reacting to the erosion of Confucian values many Koreans are turning to religion especially Christianity 
473c0217 Buddhism is enjoying a resurgence as well 
473c0218 They\'re looking for something says Mr\. Seo

473c0304 As a result many insurance issues are down ten to twenty five \%PERCENT from their highs reached mostly last spring 
473c0305 The bulls argue however that sellers are leaving the party too soon 
473c0306 For one thing they say the large premium increases of the past few years have only begun to appear in insurers\' bottom lines 
473c0307 For nineteen eighty seven earnings gains of twenty five to more than fifty \%PERCENT from nineteen eighty six levels are almost a certainty at these companies 
473c0308 And most analysts expect the earnings growth to continue albeit at a more modest rate in nineteen eighty eight 
473c0309 However one source close to the companies said he wouldn\'t rule out the possibility of Limited buying I\. Magnin 
473c030a Limited Chairman Leslie H\. Wexner has said he is interested in operating a specialty department store 
473c030b Limited operates such stores as Limited Limited Express Lane Bryant Henri Bendel and Victoria\'s Secret 
473c030c To get around that requirement insurers can pay a reinsurer to assume part of the risk of loss on the annuity in return for part of the premium 
473c030d But most reinsurance contracts don\'t transfer investment risk the risk of failing to earn enough to pay the promised rates 
473c030e That\'s where First Executive which has relied heavily on reinsurance to support expansion of it business and the regulators haven\'t agreed on the proper form of contract 
473c030f The Kroh brothers mismanaged but it was not for the purpose of lining their own pockets he says

473c030p [loud_breath] The union said the workers\' complaints persuaded it to place a team of organizers in Smyrna last July 
473c030q It has started collecting support cards from employees and if thirty \%PERCENT of the plant\'s thirty two hundred workers sign up the union can request an election 
473c030r Mr\. Bieber said the union hasn\'t set a deadline to complete the drive

473c030w You can do it in small sessions 
473c030x Now I only go into the gym twice a week and it\'s like recess the favorite part of my day not an intrusion on my life 
473c030y Another lesson she came away with is that the amount of weight is irrelevant in terms of exercising

473c0316 Additional payments to be made over an eight year period have a current value of six \.POINT one million Nichols said

473c0402 In addition to treating fractures the devices are used to treat disorders where surgery has failed and for certain *congenital* di- disorders the company said 
473c0403 But some orthopedic specialists don\'t think the devices work the company acknowledged 
473c0404 The four oh decision is a second victory for broadcasters promoting a new technology called high definition television 
473c0405 Those broadcasters have argued that they will need additional television frequencies to transmit high definition pictures 
473c0406 [loud_breath] But mobile radio companies have urged the F\. C\. C\. to reallocate the frequencies for such uses as police or fire department radio 
473c0407 The proposed agreement is an interim arrangement that would require that the two sides draw up a full debt restructuring for Brazil by around the end of the year 
473c0408 Brazil also would be required to agree on an economic program with the International Monetary Fund 
473c0409 Any agreement with the I\. M\. F\. is likely to provoke strong opposition in Brazil where the fund is loathed for promoting austerity 
473c040a And there is speculation that Mr\. Bresser may resign or allow himself to be ousted as a sacrifice for securing an I\. M\. F\. program

473c040h A merger with Macy which is roughly half the size of Federated could be attractive to the larger retailer\'s executives 
473c040i Macy\'s smaller size could leave Federated\'s officers with operating power in a combined concern 
473c040j And feelings at Federated have run high against Campeau which surprised the company with a hostile bid last month 
473c040k However Campeau\'s bid is all cash and the Macy bid isn\'t 
473c040l The proposed merger of Comex and the rival New York Mercantile Exchange is a big issue however 
473c040m Nymex has put merger talks on hold until it sees who the new Comex chairman is 
473c040n We can\'t continue as a metals exchange 
473c040o We must expand through merger Mr\. Hanemann says

473c040r He added though I am reasonably optimistic about the inflation outlook 
473c040s Wage increases have remained moderate and given the recent softness in oil prices energy prices should put a damper on consumer and producer price increases

473c040x Dan Quayle cared deeply even though this did not concern his constituents any more than it did other Americans 
473c040y Even though preserving conventionally armed G\. L\. C\. M\.s ground launched cruise missiles is hardly a popular rallying cry 
473c040z Even though the issue concerned future security rather than today\'s safety 
473c0410 And even though he opposed the decision of a president he always sought to support 
473c0411 These are the traits that I respect in him and on which we have built a warm personal friendship over the years 
473c0412 Mr\. Minoli the U\. S\. general manager says Benetton recently dropped its strategy of saturating the market with small stores 
473c0413 Now it is concentrating on professionalism and the servicing of existing stores he says 
473c0414 [loud_breath] New stores will be larger outlets called United Colors that will offer a much broader range of merchandise 
473c0415 Benetton plans to have ten United Colors shops operating in the U\. S\. by next spring 
473c0416 Mr\. Minoli also estimates that as many as one hundred smaller Benetton stores may close in the next five years

473c041c If we can keep that up we\'ll be all right 
473c041d Doing everything people want the F\. D\. A\. to do would require an F\. D\. A\. the size of the Defense Department he says 
473c041e But over the last decade the agency has instead shrunk to seventy four hundred employees from eighty one hundred 
473c041f The Bush administration is seeking a budget authorization of five hundred and seventy million dollars for the next fiscal year a five \%PERCENT increase 
474c0201 For investors the partnerships are only as attractive as the underlying buyouts 
474c0202 Many in the field contend that the buyouts being put together these days are generally overpriced because of several factors 
474c0203 [tongue_click] Among them too much capital chasing too few good candidates which has pushed costs up and returns down to what they see as unacceptable levels 
474c0204 The S\. E\. C\. sanctions against the firm and Mr\. Blinder were handed down in December

474c0209 We\'re selling eight hundred million dollars of notes in a private placement he said

474c020g For the month Continental flew three \.POINT three billion revenue passenger miles a ninety five \%PERCENT increase from the one \.POINT seven billion miles a year earlier 
474c020h A revenue passenger mile is one paying passenger flown one mile 
474c020i The increase reflects the consolidation with People Express 
474c020j The Japanese stock market is awash with liquidity Mr\. Grant says 
474c020k But in June suddenly with no apparent drainage it went down and kept going down he says 
474c020l What is a mystery to Mr\. Grant and many others is that the Tokyo market has since staged a vigorous rebound 
474c020m A one hundred fifty million dollar issue of Household Finance Corporation seven year notes was offered through underwriters led by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets 
474c020n The ten \%PERCENT notes were priced at par and the return is zero \.POINT seven two of a percentage point above the rate on comparable Treasury notes

474c020r Bolstered by strong equity capital positions superregionals already are growing faster than money center institutions 
474c020s Passage of the Kennedy Markey bill or similar grants of moral rights would enrich established artists at the expense of their struggling competitors 
474c020t In addition the theory of moral rights is both philosophically untenable and an invitation to an orgy of litigation and legal confusion 
474c020u Congress should refuse to grant artists special rights and should refuse to sign the Bern Convention 
474c020v They classified everything I had to say as racist or sexist says Mr\. Schaub [sniff]

474c020z Some economists say inflationary pressures could continue to push up U\. S\. interest rates this year 
474c0210 If so foreign central banks may see that as an opportunity to tighten and to address their own inflation worries despite U\. S\. concern 
474c0211 One fear says Irving Trust economist Robert McGee is that higher global rates will send the financial markets into a tailspin 
474c0212 By contracting out production to American plants they are saving more than a dime per can of drink 
474c0213 Their next logical step analysts say will be to acquire U\. S\. soft drink concerns 
474c0214 Eventually they might even break into the enormous U\. S\. market 
474c0215 And it doesn\'t appear that cable owners will resist the change 
474c0216 A spokesman for the National Cable Television Association said We don\'t oppose the proposal in principle 
474c0217 We take the position that the more people in the cable market the better 
474c0218 The plot is a true life tale of M\. C\. A\. itself and the ending has yet to be played out 
474c0219 But the revelations have already raised eyebrows in Hollywood where M\. C\. A\. is considered part of the bedrock of the entertainment industry 
474c021a M\. C\. A\. had two \.POINT six billion dollars in revenue last year owns Universal Studios and is a television music and real estate giant

474c021c Education is the opportunity through studying a variety of subjects to gain information and the dexterity to use your wits and your expression

474c0301 Most unusually this time around the cyclical climb in plant usage hasn\'t yet occurred 
474c0302 As the expansion keeps rolling however this is expected to come 
474c0303 When it does forecasters look for brisker capital spending as well regardless of the new tax rules 
474c0304 It\'s a sad day for Wall Street said a First Boston Corporation spokesman 
474c0305 Stock traders cautioned that the government hasn\'t yet won convictions on its latest cases 
474c0306 But both lawmakers and stock market professionals said yesterday\'s arrests send a clear signal An overhaul of takeover and securities practices has become increasingly likely 
474c0307 The Singapore economy after its first downturn in nearly two decades of double digit growth is on the road to recovery analysts say 
474c0308 After contracting one \.POINT eight \%PERCENT in nineteen eighty five the island\'s gross domestic product grew one \.POINT nine \%PERCENT last year according to the government\'s initial estimates 
474c0309 Expansion of three \%PERCENT to four \%PERCENT is predicted for this year 
474c030a This year the same forces are at work 
474c030b I believe the chances of a repeat of last year\'s performance are high says William Sterling a Merrill Lynch economist in Tokyo 
474c030c He expects to see only about seven billion dollars of additional spending not the thirty six billion dollars that Mr\. Nakasone is talking about 
474c030d Her husband Carl is a Pennsylvania state trooper 
474c030e To avoid any conflict over salaries they put her forty six thousand dollar income in a savings account and live off his thirty one thousand dollar income 
474c030f I look at it as seventy seven thousand dollars that we made together says Mr\. Stephens 
474c030g Bad management may be common enough in American business but the risks presented by badly run nuclear plants are frightening 
474c030h No level of technical safeguards can make a nuclear facility safe unless it has good management the N\. R\. C\. told Congress last year [sniff] 
474c030i Indeed the agency recently has begun to close plants because of management not just mechanical shortcomings 
474c030j In April for instance the agency ordered Philadelphia Electric Company to turn off its Peach Bottom plant after inspectors found operators asleep at the controls

474c030o How much will the government control the economy 
474c030p Are the Danes supposed to listen seriously to Secretary Shultz when he tells them that the proposed Danish policy toward ships undercuts the nuclear deterrence of NATO 
474c030q Wasn\'t Mr\. Shultz just in Moscow working on yet another nuclear treaty 
474c030r Haven\'t American diplomats at NATO been telling everyone that compared with the political effects of not ratifying the treaty the political effects of ratification would be minimal 
474c030s Many fund managers here say America isn\'t taking the strong medicine needed to curb high consumer spending improve low personal savings rates and combat the stubborn dual of deficits 
474c030t They don\'t expect any progress before the new U\. S\. president takes office next year and say both inflation and interest rates probably will rise 
474c030u This would increase the likelihood of a nineteen eighty nine recession 
474c030v Mr\. Kavner said the rival group lacks a clear process for resolving differences 
474c030w In addition he said A\. T\. and T\. spends far more each year on developing Unix than the Open Software Foundation has indicated it will spend [sniff] 
474c030x He added that A\. T\. and T\. plans to incorporate into its Unix any useful features from its rivals\' version

474c0315 Details are still murky about the rest of the credits 
474c0316 Italian officials say that Rome\'s decision to grant about a seven hundred seventy five million dollar guarantee of export credits was primarily a political rather than a banking decision 
474c0317 Britain\'s Midland Bank has announced plans for a number one billion credit line though some British banks may be getting cold feet about participating 
474c0318 French banks have yet to announce their plans officially but are said to be considering loans of two billion dollars 
474c0319 The Fed report gave no hint that makers of capital equipment expect demand for their wares to fall off 
474c031a Production of business equipment though reduced by the drop in auto and truck production grew zero \.POINT two \%PERCENT in July after remaining flat in June 
474c031b The Fed attributed the increase to stepped up production of commercial and factory equipment as well as aircraft 
474c031c Output of industrial materials also rebounded in July after dropping for two months 
474c031d It\'s kind of like eating peanuts isn\'t it said Mr\. Murphy

474c031f The umpteenth sound of lead smacking metal and a rifle being cocked served as a quick answer to his question 
474c0401 They have put in a lot of money but is that enough 
474c0402 Nobody knows said Mr\. Bray

474c040h The forecast is a bit rosier than that of most private analysts 
474c040i In its latest survey Blue Chip Economic Indicators consensus forecast puts growth at one \.POINT eight \%PERCENT this year 
474c040j More than three fourths of the economists polled expect a recession to start before the end of nineteen eighty nine 
474c040k As of April first all interest income will be taxed at twenty \%PERCENT 
474c040l Exemptions include single mothers the handicapped and those over sixty five years old 
474c040m Other exceptions include funds set aside for housing and pensions 
474c040n The point a point Mr\. Campbell keeps returning to is that every religion is true 
474c040o It\'s true as a metaphor for the human and cosmic mysteries 
474c040p It\'s only when you\'re stuck on the metaphor that you get in trouble 
474c040q Mr\. Howard not only helped the fledgling public companies drum up interest in their shares he helped invest the capital they raised in the public offerings 
474c040r In many cases the banks he advised invested large amounts in each other 
474c040s And they lent funds to other clients of Mr\. Howard who sometimes invests in the same stocks 
474c040t Acquired in nineteen seventy nine Friendly reported modest growth until last year when labor shortages and lower customer traffic hurt the chain 
474c040u The unit improved sales with higher prices new store openings and the acquisition of two small restaurant chains during the second half of nineteen eighty six 
474c040v However Friendly\'s nineteen eighty seven pretax operating profit of forty five \.POINT six million dollars was below the previous year\'s fifty \.POINT four million dollars 
474c040w Tens of thousands of Burmese marched in Rangoon and fourteen other cities to protest the government of new leader Sein Lwin 
474c040x State run radio monitored in Bangkok reported violent incidents in Mandalay 
474c040y Diplomats said at least eight people were killed in the protests 
474c040z Students Buddhist monks and others participated in the demonstrations 
474c0410 We\'ve always wondered how to square Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega\'s rough words with his soft treatment in the Democratic controlled U\. S\. Congress 
474c0411 Maybe he has too . because he\'s upped the ante 
474c0412 He has now branded not only the Republicans but also the Democrats as imperialists because both parties have talked recently about helping the Contras 
474c0413 What do the Democrats become if they actually vote the bandages 
474c0414 The Treasury is scheduled to announce details of its quarterly financing operation November second 
474c0415 It usually consists of three year notes ten year notes and thirty year bonds 
474c0416 But the department is very close to reaching its limits on issuing long term debt and thus has asked Congress to increase its authority 
474c0417 Congress still hasn\'t completed work on the issue which is part of the tax bill passed late Tuesday by the Senate 
474c0418 Clarke Swanson noting that nineteen million women had stayed in the work force after World War two thought they could use help in whipping up quick meals 
474c0419 So in nineteen fifty one the Swanson company began selling frozen pot pies turkey chicken and meat 
474c041a The first production order called for twenty thousand pies 
474c041b Soon it was two hundred fifty thousand a day 
474c041c By nineteen fifty three Clarke and his brother were ready for the next step complete frozen dinners 
474c041d Thousands of Azerbaijan workers rallied in the Soviet republic\'s capital Baku after a day of work stoppages to back demands for greater local autonomy 
474c041e In Estonia the Communist Party chief urged ethnic Russian workers to end a six day strike over a new law tightening residency requirements 
474c041f Strikes also were threatened in Georgia 
475c0201 [tongue_click] First of all the policy conservatives will pursue their unfinished agenda of deregulation in areas from financial services to regulation as a drag on U\. S\. international competitiveness 
475c0202 [tongue_click] They say the administration missed its chance and allowed its deregulatory campaign to be all but aborted by controversy over Anne Gorsuch and Jim Watt 
475c0203 They think their general case in this area is overwhelming 
475c0204 They will give it new applications and carry it to new forums 
475c0205 The new service differs from the shuttle in several ways [<door_slam] 
475c0206 It won\'t have the backup planes that the shuttle uses to accommodate passenger overflow 
475c0207 The new flights will include advance seat selection and first class and coach service which the shuttle doesn\'t 
475c0208 Shuttle flights depart on the hour the new service will operate on the half hour 
475c0209 Mr\. Gittis said the lawsuits would have little influence on the response of Revlon\'s board to the tender offer 
475c020a [tongue_click] He said MacAndrews and Forbes rather than Revlon is borrowing the money needed to acquire Revlon and take it private 
475c020b We\'re selling eight hundred million dollars of notes in a private placement he said 
475c020c If we were using Revlon assets the suits could be troublesome 
475c020d [tongue_click] Still Mr\. Josephs and others think that the changes will be good for the farm economy in general 
475c020e [tongue_click] Many of these gentlemen farmers were tax motivated not profit driven he says [door_slam] 
475c020f Some are unfair competition against the regular farmer who\'s trying to make a buck 
475c020g About two weeks ago Southland acknowledged that it was considering restructuring alternatives but wouldn\'t elaborate 
475c020h The owner and operator of eight thousand two hundred seven Eleven stores repeatedly has said it didn\'t know of reasons for the heavy trading in its stock 
475c020i [tongue_click] But stock traders continued to expect Southland to take some action [loud_breath] even while several analysts and industry executives said they believed Southland and wouldn\'t respond unless a hostile bidder emerged 
475c020j In Korea labor conflicts have added heat to the unstable political situation 
475c020k The new unions are growing more adversarial 
475c020l [tongue_click] Companies keep asking the government to smash the unions 
475c020m But the ruling party can\'t risk alienating workers who will vote in the coming elections 
475c020n It refuses so far to backtrack on its July one promise of greater democracy or to return to the policy of overt union busting 
475c020o [tongue_click] Worlds of Wonder needs to convince creditors to extend it time through the Christmas season which is by far the biggest sales period for toy companies 
475c020p It\'s in the creditors\' best interest to keep the company going at least for now said Fred Anschel the analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc\. 
475c020q As of September thirtieth the company\'s inventory was a hundred and twenty eight million dollars a spokeswoman said 
475c020r Congress\'s joint tax committee now is without a staff chief 
475c020s [tongue_click] David Brockway has left as planned to join the Washington law office of Dewey Ballantine Bushby Palmer and Wood 
475c020t successor hasn\'t been named 
475c020u BankAmerica is now writing off fewer of its problem loans than most other large banks 
475c020v The development has left some analysts wondering whether the bank is being aggressive enough especially considering its record of surprising loan problems over the past three years 
475c020w But bank officials said they are being prudent 
475c020x They said lower write offs reflect previous housecleaning as well as more conservative lending practices 
475c020y [tongue_click] In addition the bank has a beefed up team of specialists who are having increasing success in recovering previously written off loans 
475c020z The only new issue priced yesterday was five hundred and fifty million of a twelve year senior subordinated debenture from U\. S\. G\. Corporation 
475c0210 The high risk high yield issue was priced at par to yield thirteen and a quarter \%PERCENT by Salomon Brothers Inc\. and Goldman Sachs and Company 
475c0211 The offering is part of U\. S\. G\.\'s recapitalization plan 
475c0212 Mr\. Zehnder plays down this criticism 
475c0213 [tongue_click] He points to the fact that Credit Suisse leads in the number of publicly listed bonds launched but lags in the number of unlisted notes it issued 
475c0214 This is significant he says because bond issues pay higher commissions than unlisted notes 
475c0215 In contrast Senator Bentsen campaigned last week in a half empty plane to a measured cadence 
475c0216 He portrays Governor Dukakis as a pragmatic can do executive 
475c0217 [tongue_click] And he offers himself a business oriented Senate Finance Committee chairman and former insurance executive [loud_breath] as evidence of that moderation 
475c0218 The recurring words of his speeches are the words of the boardroom Competence hands on management enhanced recovery 
475c0219 [tongue_click] Mr\. Kidder insists there is cause for hope 
475c021a Good teachers put snags in the river of children passing by [loud_breath] and over the years they redirect hundreds of lives 
475c021b Perhaps he is right [loud_breath] 
475c021c But what he notices at the fifth grade science fair seems more significant 
475c021d The results of that painful charade don\'t reflect social status ethnic background or teaching technique They reflect the contributions of each child\'s parents 
475c021e Aviation insurance is under intense pressure 
475c021f The global airline premiums have dropped to about four hundred million dollars from about one billion in nineteen eighty seven 
475c021g Meanwhile airline losses in nineteen eighty eight rose significantly from the previous year 
475c0301 [tongue_click] The economic fallout shouldn\'t be ignored however 
475c0302 A provision in the spending bill requires that at least one third of the repair and overhaul work on ships be done locally at their home ports 
475c0303 That makes it a big deal for Todd and Lockheed Mr\. Dicks says referring to two Puget Sound shipyards 
475c0304 The government civil suit alleged that a defect could cause the rear brakes to lock sending the car spinning out of control 
475c0305 G\. M\. which no longer makes the X\. cars denied that the brakes are defective 
475c0306 Agreeing with G\. M\. Judge Jackson ruled that the government came to court with nothing more essentially than a reasonable suspicion that a defect existed 
475c0307 Inco\'s stock has caught technical analysts\' attention too 
475c0308 It recently broke out of a five year trading range says Martin Pring editor of Pring Market Review 
475c0309 [tongue_click] He thinks the stock could be poised for big gains reflecting what may be a bull market in base metals 
475c030a Rent control is as bad as the income tax deduction for home ownership 
475c030b All the beneficiaries of the deduction are high income earners not simply some of them 
475c030c It leads to extra large swimming pools extra bedrooms in Beverly Hills but no housing for the people who need it most 
475c030d Still when this issue was last voted on in Congress eighty five out of eighty five senators present voted for it 
475c030e The only surprising thing given the number of beneficiaries is that somehow the other fifteen senators didn\'t manage to get their names on the roll call 
475c030f Mr\. Zinn said Entertainment Marketing is still weighing a proxy fight 
475c030g It\'s a bad feeling in your stomach when the chairman and previous bidder is selling his block he said 
475c030h It doesn\'t make me as a shareholder comfortable with what is happening in the company 
475c030i Under the plan the Edelman group would contribute about a hundred million dollars in equity to the transaction 
475c030j The remainder would be financed with debt and debt securities 
475c030k If the plan succeeds Shearson would be entitled to receive warrants to buy ten to twenty \%PERCENT of the fully diluted common equity of the company 
475c030l [tongue_click] Frank Perez a retired diplomat recalls the day he left for a two year stint as the deputy chief of mission in Turkey 
475c030m Fidelity\'s packers he says spread the Perez family furnishings in the front yard [loud_breath] then left for an extended lunch break 
475c030n Minutes later there was a drenching rain 
475c030o [tongue_click] In nineteen eighty four when he returned much of the furniture was soggy and moldy 
475c030p While chronicling the doings of the highfalutin may seem light stuff to some Mr\. Revson says his own approach to the subject matter isn\'t 
475c030q It isn\'t just throwing together a string of names and saying they sipped champagne ate caviar and wore Bill Blass the columnist says 
475c030r Facts are important

475c030w The king\'s request left the delegates in a tight spot 
475c030x To ignore Jordan and make a substantial formal cash pledge to the P\. L\. O\. would signal a shift away from moderation difficult for the gulf states to countenance 
475c030y But to finance both Jordan and the P\. L\. O\. risked triggering a clamor from other cash strapped states covered under the Baghdad agreement such as Lebanon and Syria 
475c030z But other evidence on flaps is conflicting 
475c0310 One of the crew members can be heard on the cockpit voice recorder calling out Flaps fifteen fifteen the correct position for the flaps 
475c0311 And the recorder indicates that a cockpit alarm that should have alerted the crew to improperly set flaps didn\'t go off 
475c0312 When the House and Senate approved the tax bill early Saturday lawmakers didn\'t mention the last minute provisions and congressional staffers described them as technical 
475c0313 [tongue_click] While the estimated revenue of almost a hundred million dollars over three years is relatively small the provisions might be perceived as an anti takeover push by Congress 
475c0314 They could have the effect of slowing certain takeover activity congressional sources acknowledged over the weekend 
475c0315 To be sure the deficit has declined in the past few years 
475c0316 But that decline is entirely the result of a rising surplus in the Social Security trust fund 
475c0317 That money should be invested to help defray the future retirement costs of the baby boomers [loud_breath] instead it is being used to paper over the deficit 
475c0318 [loud_breath] That\'s yet another symptom of Mr\. Darman\'s national now now ism 
475c0319 [tongue_click] This year the Soviets have moved commercial sales to the front burner 
475c031a export arm of the Soviet Ministry of Aviation Industry hopes to double its revenue by the mid nineteen nineties 
475c031b But such a shift would bring major upheavals to the Soviet system 
475c031c Orders for military aircraft have fallen twenty \%PERCENT in the past two years according to some estimates 
475c031d [tongue_click] And for the first time in decades prestigious military design bureaus in the Soviet Union are devoting substantial manpower to civilian projects 
475c031e Ashton Tate has been plagued by operating losses and management turmoil

475c0401 [tongue_click] Last week there were reports that after the offering Shearson Lehman had a big unsold chunk of stock 
475c0402 [tongue_click] In a narrowly drawn statement vice chairman Herbert Freiman denied Shearson had offered a block to Salomon Brothers [loud_breath] which managed the selling brokers\' floor operation 
475c0403 Mr\. Freiman wouldn\'t elaborate 
475c0404 That may be but there are tough calls 
475c0405 Emotional upset headaches backaches and other subjective symptoms are hard to quantify 
475c0406 Besides someone who truly feels disabled may as a result actually be disabled 
475c0407 [tongue_click] A well timed period of time off with stress reduction and an effort at better understanding may prevent a much worse disability later 
475c0408 It may also uncover factors at the workplace that can be improved 
475c0409 I try to give the patient the benefit of the doubt within reason 
475c040a Not doing so is more than unkind it risks harm to the patient and lawsuits that neither the physician nor employer would welcome 
475c040b [tongue_click] But some find electronic investing isn\'t worth the trouble 
475c040c Mr\. Jeffers estimates that a third of investment software buyers eventually junk their purchases because the technology baffles them 
475c040d And while some investors say computers have made them money others have squandered small fortunes because they relied too heavily on technology 
475c040e Bankers say Chile Mexico and the Philippines have accounted for most of the estimated six billion dollars of debt equity swaps to date 
475c040f Some bankers have estimated that the total may rise as high as ten billion this year

475c040h The utility will begin paying interest in cash after Seabrook goes into service Mr\. Bayless said 
475c040i Mr\. Harrison said the company doesn\'t know how long it will take to leap the political hurdles that are blocking Seabrook 
475c040j But the financial restructuring is intended to keep the company going without additional borrowing until nineteen ninety or nineteen ninety one he said 
475c040k Judge Bork however asked for none of this

475c040m I told him I would do this unless he violently objected 
475c040n He said You\'re a free agent Garment 
475c040o Do what you think is appropriate 
475c040p The huge gap to a large extent is a price phenomenon 
475c040q The dollar\'s fall has pushed up the price of imports causing the deficit to swell even as the volume of non oil imports has receded 
475c040r But long before now these higher prices were supposed to lead to improvement in the monthly merchandise trade deficit as well

475c0415 Daniel J\. Gilmartin was named president and chief operating officer of Frank\'s Nursery and Crafts Detroit a unit of this specialty retailer 
475c0416 The posts had been vacant since early nineteen eighty seven

476c0201 More traditional academics say that many of the newer journals are merely platforms for marginal scholars to write on trivial topics 
476c0202 I\'m dimly aware that they\'re out there says Richard Ullman professor of international affairs at Princeton University [loud_breath] and a former editor of Foreign Policy magazine

476c0206 But the financial restructuring is intended to keep the company going without additional borrowing until nineteen ninety or ninety one he said 
476c0207 [tongue_click] Analysts also said they hadn\'t expected lower operating profits for the company\'s Industries Group and for the broadcasting segment 
476c0208 Westinghouse officials told analysts that operating profit in the Industries Group fell fifteen to twenty \%PERCENT hurt in part by weak results in Canadian operations 
476c0209 A sharp drop in operating profit from the Broadcasting Group\'s production company contributed to the slightly lower operating earnings overall for that segment 
476c020a Kemp\'s campaign takes on an increasingly desperate tone

476c020c Even some supporters now say privately that he should aim for the vice presidential nomination 
476c020d But his longtime hostilities with Dole leave a spot on a Bush ticket as about the only possibility 
476c020e Those lands have become worth much more than the transportation and energy concern needs for the railroad [loud_breath] and the company had been trying to free itself from the liens

476c020i On a per ton basis pretax profit doubled to about thirty six dollars from eighteen dollars in the third quarter 
476c020j [tongue_click] However the performance fell far short of U\. S\. X\. Chairman David Roderick\'s prediction [loud_breath] of fifty dollars plus per ton profit 
476c020k Texas of course is where the most trouble is to be found 
476c020l Lenders there like to blame the so called oil patch recession 
476c020m [tongue_click] But the problem in fact is bad banking in a few cases even corrupt banking 
476c020n Some parts of Texas the Dallas Fort 
476c020o Worth area for example haven\'t had anything that legitimately could be called a recession 
476c020p The main reason so many lenders are in trouble is an old fashioned failing among bankers a weakness for real estate speculation 
476c020q As a result the government is now talking of higher farm prices 
476c020r But higher farm prices would add to an already steep inflation rate 
476c020s So Beijing officials reportedly talk of tying wages to inflation [loud_breath] an idea reminiscent of the wage indexation tried in some Latin American nations several years ago with disastrous results 
476c020t Secretaries are also easy targets for a hug especially in Hollywood

476c0210 [loud_breath] One big play last year was leisure 
476c0211 Another was undervalued assets even though no one can recall a Japanese company being broken up ju(st)- for its assets 
476c0212 Once you get to that theme the level of the P\. to E\. ratio doesn\'t mean a damn says Mr\. Robins 
476c0213 It\'s all a bit of a mirage 
476c0214 Yet one that so far has worked 
476c0215 But other evidence on the flaps is conflicting 
476c0216 One of the crew members can be heard on the cockpit voice recorder calling out Flaps fifteen fifteen the correct position for the flaps 
476c0217 And the recorder indicates that a cockpit alarm that should have alerted the crew to improperly set flaps didn\'t go off 
476c0218 What bothers these people is not that Mrs\. Thatcher poses a danger to the so called unified European market 
476c0219 Mrs\. Thatcher is not opposed to this 
476c021a Britain\'s own markets are more open than those of most European countries London is way ahead of them on capital movement having abolished exchange controls altogether 
476c021b The cause of the outrage is that European unity is the device through which the regulators and socialists [loud_breath] hope to expand their group on the Continent 
476c021c Now his laughter is gone 
476c021d [tongue_click] Because of drugs he is dead 
476c021e And every day my heart breaks a little more 
476c021f [tongue_click] On the surface the trade report looked encouraging 
476c021g [tongue_click] The nation\'s seasonally adjusted trade deficit narrowed to eight \.POINT one seven billion dollars in June the lowest monthly deficit since December nineteen eighty four 
476c021h What\'s more the May trade deficit was revised down to ten \.POINT oh two billion dollars [loud_breath] from the ten \.POINT two four billion originally reported 
476c0301 So far illegal foreign workers aren\'t taken as a job threat by Japanese workers 
476c0302 But Japanese unemployment is at historically high levels because of the yen\'s strength [loud_breath] posing a knotty problem for the government 
476c0303 Many Japanese companies in such industries as steel and shipbuilding are cutting their labor forces 
476c0304 [lip_smack] [tongue_click] In the past Filipinos in many rural areas preferred the disciplined terror of the N\. P\. A\. to the random excesses of the country\'s military 
476c0305 [tongue_click] With the change of government last year a mild improvement in military behavior and the detection of the Mindanao slaughters some Filipinos are changing their minds 
476c0306 Diplomats and political analysts say they don\'t know if the trend presages significant popular resistance to the Communists or just additional turmoil in the Philippine countryside 
476c0307 [tongue_click] There is a wide variation in thinking about how sick one is and how important time off is in order to get well 
476c0308 The patients\' responsibilities outside of work also vary 
476c0309 [tongue_click] It\'s hard to say to what degree these factors should influence disability status 
476c030a [tongue_click] Most physicians probably consider them important 
476c030b [tongue_click] In Cleveland Higbee chief executive officer Robert Broadbent says the retailer has benefited from its parent\'s financial expertise 
476c030c Although it will retain control Industrial Equity is planning to take Higbee public again probably in June 
476c030d Meanwhile says Mr\. Broadbent They\'ve made us more inquisitive about acquisitions ourselves 
476c030e The loan is part of a seventy five million dollar plan to expand the mine\'s reserves and allow it to keep operating until nineteen ninety four 
476c030f Without the expansion the mine was threatened with closure next year 
476c030g Closure would mean the loss of seven hundred and fifteen jobs 
476c030h Administration officials are concerned by intelligence reports that suggest that Iran is thinking about organizing terrorist strikes against a- American West European and Arab targets 
476c030i The administration has alerted embassies and military bases of an *increased* threat 
476c030j [loud_breath] Administration officials say intelligence also shows that Iran has laid the groundwork for terrorism [loud_breath] in the U\. S\. 
476c030k Within an hour Barclays P\. L\. C\. Lloyds Bank P\. L\. C\. and the London unit of Citicorp increased their base rates

476c030m [tongue_click] Similar increases by National Westminster Bank P\. L\. C\. and Midland Bank P\. L\. C\. go into effect today 
476c030n Base rates are the benchmark for commercial lending in Britain 
476c030o [tongue_click] The following officers directors and large stockholders of companies reported changes in holdings under the Securities Exchange Act of nineteen thirty four 
476c030p Those identified as beneficial *owners* hold at least ten \%PERCENT of a company\'s equity securities 
476c030q Unless otherwise noted changes involved direct holdings of common stock and took place in May nineteen eighty eight 
476c030r Companies are listed where transitions generally aggregate a- ten thousand shares or one hundred thousand dollars 
476c030s [tongue_click] Another condition is that Topeka Group a unit of Duluth Minnesota based Minnesota Power and Light Company exercise its option to buy Deltona\'s utility subsidiaries 
476c030t Based on current book value the subsidiaries would fetch thirty two \.POINT five million dollars in cash plus preferred stock in one of the utility units 
476c030u Topeka said it intends to exercise the option 
476c030v [tongue_click] The biggest hurdle was to find the funds to meet the cost of reconstruction inclusive of the issue of stamps 
476c030w However response to the government\'s international appeal for assistance has been extremely heartwarming 
476c030x [tongue_click] The funds required for public sector assistance have been realized [loud_breath] and the further amount required is expected to flow from the proceeds of overseas reinsurance of pro:perty damage 
476c030y [tongue_click] To begin with companies have been doing a good job of managing inventories 
476c030z In the past businesses have tended to become increasingly optimistic as expansions persisted 
476c0310 When sales eventually slowed inventories quickly reached excessive levels 
476c0311 Companies thereupon cut their buying industrial production declined [loud_breath] and a recession was under way 
476c0312 Thirty one teams of nineteen representing businesses schools and assorted other groups signed up for the first local competition 
476c0313 For weeks drums were heard along the Willamette as the teams practiced 
476c0314 Boats f:ull of men and women in business suits fresh from work or happy hour [loud_breath] were not an uncommon sight 
476c0315 [tongue_click] These mixed feelings of frustration with and gratitude toward the authorities are part of the everyday life of a foreigner doing business in Korea [cross_talk] 
476c0316 In fact such contradictions are what seem to make the Korean world go round 
476c0317 [loud_breath] A Western businessman needs to be ready for them 
476c0318 [loud_breath] Here are a few hard earned facts of Korean business life [door_slam] 
476c0319 But many local businesses that depend upon tourism aren\'t convinced 
476c031a [loud_breath] They argue that a commercial mine might get played out in a few years 
476c031b [tongue_click] And they fear that many tourists who trek here for the tantalizing prospect of finding a diamond in the field [loud_breath] will take their vacations elsewhere 
476c0401 [tongue_click] The court was split on both the Williams Act and the commerce clause 
476c0402 Justice Lewis Powell acknowledged that the nineteen eighty two case of Edgar v\. 
476c0403 MITE suggested that any state law that favored targets more than did the Williams Act [loud_breath] would be invalid because Congress had preempted local regulations 
476c0404 The court backtracked here to say that state laws might be O\. K\. if they help the Williams Act purpose by heaping even more burdens on acquirers 
476c0405 [loud_breath] It has relieved at least some of the frustration felt by the farmers says Peter Brent a member of a farm activist group 
476c0406 If they go to mediation at least the lender has to listen 
476c0407 Nearly a dozen other states have inquired into Iowa\'s program 
476c0408 [tongue_click] And mandatory mediation modeled on Iowa\'s program is currently being considered by the California and Missouri legislatures 
476c0409 [tongue_click] Ogilvy is the nation\'s fifth largest advertising agency [loud_breath] with nineteen eighty six billings of three \.POINT two billion dollars 
476c040a Roughly half of those billings came from outside the U\. S\. Mr\. Roman said 
476c040b [misc_noise] Agencies traditionally have taken fifteen \%PERCENT of billings as a commission 
476c040c [tongue_click] L\. T\. V\. has said repeatedly since its filing that it would fight any creditor move to either reorganize the unit separately or force its sale 
476c040d [tongue_click] Creditors on the other hand have discussed the idea almost since the day of L\. T\. V\.\'s filing 
476c040e And the pension agency the banks and the committee representing u- unsecured creditors have recently been holding serious discussions on the issue 
476c040f In reaction to the news interest rates plunged the Australian dollar firmed and analysts predicted stock:s would move higher 
476c040g [misc_noise] [loud_breath] But while the budget gave a boost to the markets it also *presaged* a greater austerity for the nation as a whole 
476c040h [tongue_click] To Mr\. Hawke that is as it should be 
476c040i [tongue_click] Australians have to recognize that we aren\'t out of the woods yet he says 
476c040j We\'ve got enormous problems and we have to learn to live within our resources 
476c040k [tongue_click] Despite all the uncertainty that surrounded British Petroleum\'s jumbo offering there wasn\'t that much turmoil in the market when shares began to trade Friday 
476c040l B\. P\.\'s partially paid American depositary shares closed unchanged [loud_breath] at seventeen and a quarter with thirteen \.POINT two million traded 
476c040m [tongue_click] It was the Big Board\'s most active issue 
476c040n The rollbacks could be unexpectedly painful for some hourly workers 
476c040o [loud_breath] Chrysler\'s unemployment fund has been drained to the point that benefits are already being reduced [loud_breath] a U\. A\. W\. spokesman said 
476c040p The fund has at least in part [loud_breath] been drained by workers temporarily laid off when plants were closed down for retooling 
476c040q Here are price trends on the world\'s major stock markets as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital i- International Perspective Geneva 
476c040r To make them directly comparable each index is based on the close of nineteen sixty nine equaling one hundred 
476c040s The percentage change is since year end 
476c040t [tongue_click] We want more institutional assets says a Kemper spokeswoman 
476c040u We think the business holds considerable promise for the future she adds and we think Citicorp is a capable organization 
476c040v Others say institutional asset management is still considered a good business despite relatively low fees and signs of slowing growth 
476c040w First Boston and Xerox had no comment 
476c040x [tongue_click] The chief operating officer would have both the footwear and apparel business reporting to him 
476c040y [tongue_click] Mr\. Shelton had led an improved performance of the latter during the past two years 
476c040z He also has a long term relationship with company chairman and chief executive officer William S\. Wire the second working for Genesco since nineteen fifty six 
476c0410 Farm futures prices have fallen several times in the past two weeks following several weeks of drought inspired rally 
476c0411 [tongue_click] Yesterday\'s trading seemed to support the notion among some analysts that corn and wheat futures are top heavy 
476c0412 The market has been overdone significantly on the upside said Richard Loewy senior grain and oil seed analyst with Prudential Bache Securities Incorporated 
476c0413 The piper has to be paid on the other side 
476c0414 [tongue_click] One of the four businesses included in the lockup option granted to K\. K\. R\. is Macmillan\'s directory division [loud_breath] which consists of Who\'s Who [loud_breath] and National Registry Publishing 
476c0415 Thus it wasn\'t immediately clear why International Thomson might be looking at the operation even though it is included in the lockup option 
476c0416 A spokesman for K\. K\. R\. also declined comment 
476c0417 The decision frees Interior officials to formally open oil company bids to lease up to five \.POINT six million acres in a salmon rich area near the Bering Sea 
476c0418 The government solicited bids for the sale in January nineteen eighty six but until now has been barred by court order from opening them 
476c0419 Officials said the bids would be opened in Anchorage Alaska Tuesday 
476c041a To be sure on a lot of scores the summit was a success 
476c041b Economic cooperation was advanced with businessmen signing agreements for about thirty contracts and several joint ventures 
476c041c [tongue_click] Human rights too may have taken a step forward if Gorbachev lives up to his promise [loud_breath] to release all political prisoners by year\'s end 
476c041d In early nineteen eighty eight the political settlement envisioned by the non communists seemed plausible 
476c041e [tongue_click] Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev was a major reason 
476c041f Mr\. Gorbachev saw the expansionist ambitions of his predecessors stymied by the resolute containment policy of both China [loud_breath] and the pro Western A\. S\. E\. A\. N\. powers 
476c041g Support for the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia cost the Soviet Union economically and diplomatically 
476c041h So the Soviets trying to eliminate the military quagmire in Cambodia persuaded Hanoi\'s leaders to negotiate a military withdrawal from Cambodia 
477c0201 Last week there were reports that after the offering Shearson Lehman had a big unsold chunk of stock 
477c0202 In a narrowly drawn statement vice chairman Herbert Freiman denied Shearson had offered a block to Salomon Brothers which managed the selling brokers\' floor operation 
477c0203 Mr\. Freiman wouldn\'t elaborate 
477c0204 The Swiss franc bond market meanwhile remained listless despite a sharp fall in the dollar 
477c0205 Most prices were unchanged with an average turnover *traders* said 
477c0206 One Geneva trader said investors were staying out of the market because they don\'t know where the bottom is in the dollar\'s current decline 
477c0207 Closely held TransAmerican said it also agreed to settle a dispute with another creditor Medallion Oil Company 
477c0208 The proposed settlements which must be approved by the bankruptcy court would remove two major hurdles in TransAmerican\'s long struggle to get out of Chapter eleven proceedings 
477c0209 TransAmerican filed for court protection from creditors in January nineteen eighty three when it was mired in one \.POINT two billion dollars of debt 
477c020a I received welfare for eight months after my second child was born 
477c020b Luckily I was able with the help of my family to get a good job and reliable child care 
477c020c [tongue_click] But there are a lot of welfare mothers out there who aren\'t this fortunate 
477c020d A lot of women don\'t know how to get jobs or the training needed to get one and someone to watch their children 
477c020e [tongue_click] When that situation is resolved then you will see a lot of former welfare recipients becoming productive members of society 
477c020f The Sun Belt forecast partly cloudy 
477c020g Economists expect the Southeast buffered by its big service economy to continue to outperform the nation 
477c020h But some overbuilt real estate markets could get bashed and Florida\'s influx of retirees job seekers and tourists could dwindle 
477c020i The shareholder David F\. LaRoche a Providence Rhode Island investor filed the suit in a state superior court in Newport 
477c020j The suit requests the court to issue orders prohibiting the proposed acquisition and requiring Neco to hold its annual meetings and shareholders to elect four directors as soon as possible 
477c020k A superior court judge declined to issue a- a temporary restraining order requested by the suit to block the acquisition said a court clerk 
477c020l In addition *Laurentian* said Bernhard M\. Koch thirty three was named vice president and chief financial officer 
477c020m He succeeds John Strom who transferred to a Lauretarian Capital unit 
477c020n Previously Mr\. Koch was director of internal audit at Lauretarian Group Corporation and Imperial Life Assurance Company of Canada majority shareholders of Lauretarian Capital 
477c020o El Salvador\'s Duarte traveled to the U\. S\. for treatment of what he described as a malignant stomach disease 
477c020p The president has been rumored to have cancer 
477c020q A spokesman said tests would be conducted at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington 
477c020r How serious and patient investor interest is will be tested next month 
477c020s A government owned insurance agency is set to auction off the Hyatt Regency Manila 
477c020t The agency hopes to realize its target price of thirteen million dollars 
477c020u Thus instead of *CalMat\'s* being acquired select assets would be optioned and a hunk of stock would be in relatively safe hands 
477c020v CalMat would be rid of Mr\. Brierley who appears to have tried to put the company in play 
477c020w Industrial Equity executives in California didn\'t return calls seeking comment 
477c020x Mr\. Chatihachi\'s wealthy family background and his family\'s large property interests give him a good understanding of the business community 
477c020y Further he has good relations with the large ethnic Chinese community and serves as chairman of the Thai Chinese Friendship Association 
477c020z That\'s important for the country\'s business elite many of whom are ethnic Chinese 
477c0210 However conventional film will be marginally profitable at best for Polaroid because initially Polaroid won\'t be manufacturing the film contends Elliott Novak an industry consultant 
477c0211 Instead it will buy the film from another company and put its name on it just as it does with videotape 
477c0212 [tongue_click] Since it began selling videotape a few years ago [other_mouth_sound] Polaroid has built up an impressive twelve \%PERCENT market share making it the leader in the U\. S\. 
477c0213 But fierce competition has kept videotape profits slim and the conventional film business isn\'t likely to prove any bonanza either 
477c0214 Peter DaPozzo head of [loud_breath] retail trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton [loud_breath] also looks for a sharp upward move in stock prices given a few ifs 
477c0215 One is if investors don\'t get spooked at the anniversary of the crash 
477c0216 Another is if the Federal Reserve eases interest rates 
477c0217 And a third is if George Bush wins the presidential election 
477c0218 I don\'t know if the parents understand how subtle this New Age movement really is she says 
477c0219 They draw the kids in with fairy tales and sorcery 
477c021a Their ultimate goal is to do away with anybody who believes there\'s such a thing as evil 
477c021b But Yamaichi denied the rumors 
477c021c This makes a dozen calls I\'ve had on this today said an annoyed trading official at Yamaichi\'s New York based U\. S\. subsidiary 
477c021d He acknowledged that the firm actively sold S\. and P\. five hundred futures last week and that Dean Witter handled some of the sales 
477c021e But he added that we haven\'t been a heavy seller a:t all this week 
477c0301 The broadcasting properties have long been regarded as GenCorp\'s best defense against a hostile takeover 
477c0302 Licenses for two of the television stations and all the radio stations are being challenged by two groups which charge that GenCorp is an unfit operator 
477c0303 The dispute includes allegations that GenCorp failed to adequately inform the F\. C\. C\. of allegedly improper campaign contributions and foreign payments 
477c0304 The new tax law\'s limits on retirement benefits for executives spur greater interest in certain trusts that help safeguard deferred compensation until retirement time 
477c0305 Such trusts aren\'t completely inviolate creditors can claim the money after a bankruptcy for instance 
477c0306 But they are considered better than a mere promise to an executive 
477c0307 J\. W\. T\. hadn\'t yet responded to W\. P\. P\.\'s Wednesday bid of forty five dollars a share or about four hundred and sixty million dollars 
477c0308 On Friday W\. P\. P\. launched a hostile forty five dollar a share tender offer for J\. W\. T\.\'s approximately ten million shares outstanding 
477c0309 That hostile offer formally remained in effect despite W\. P\. P\.\'s latest move 
477c030a At a meeting with analysts Robert M\. Kavner A\. T\. and T\.\'s chief financial officer said It appears we will have a good year 
477c030b But in response to an analyst\'s question he said earnings of two dollars a share sounds strong 
477c030c He also warned analysts against looking at a particular quarter and isolating it adding we are looking for the annual trend line 
477c030d There\'s some paper out for bids you haven\'t heard about Cadwallader because you do only domestic 
477c030e Colombian government bonds with the coupon indexed to the street price of cocaine 
477c030f Solid investment but intriguing 
477c030g I think we\'re going to spring for that 
477c030h With a rebound in the stock market investors\' fears about a recession cooled and the bond market slumped 
477c030i A sharp slide in the U\. S\. dollar also added some downward pressure to bond prices 
477c030j Despite the decline in bonds the Federal Reserve System still continued to make good on its promise to provide ample liquidity through its open market operations 
477c030k Despite all the uncertainty that surrounded British Petroleum\'s jumbo offering there still wasn\'t that much turmoil in the market when shares began to trade Friday 
477c030l B\. P\.\'s partially paid American depositary shares closed unchanged at seventeen and a quarter with thirteen \.POINT two million traded 
477c030m It was the Big Board\'s most active issue 
477c030n Until now Nasdaq or the N\. A\. S\. D\.\'s automated quotation system has provided computer terminals with price quotations on all issues 
477c030o Most big trades however are negotiated by telephone and then recorded in the system\'s computers 
477c030p Only the small order system has provided traders with the ability to execute trades by computer rather than by telephone 
477c030q Still company insiders said the restructuring was entirely Mr\. Akers\'s plan and wasn\'t forced on him by the I\. B\. M\. board 
477c030r A director said the board learned of the plan at its meeting last Tuesday 
477c030s John found everything was coming onto his desk and he had more than he could a- cope with another director said 
477c030t He wanted an organization which resolved more problems before they got to him 
477c030u The E\. P\. A\. proposed minimum standards for municipal trash dumps that the agency estimated will cost eight hundred eighty seven million dollars a year 
477c030v The proposed rules would require about six thousand dumps to install groundwater monitoring systems 
477c030w They would also close some dumps and put special conditions on others in certain areas 
477c030x Hoping to prevent long costly disputes over what documents defendants have to surrender judges grant blanket protective orders 
477c030y The orders typically bar public dissemination of records and depositions even after settlement or verdict 
477c030z Plaintiffs\' lawyers generally haven\'t balked as long as they can get the information they need to prepare for their trials 
477c0310 Random House a subsidiary of the Newhouse family\'s Advance Publications Incorporated [loud_breath] said the move will take it out of the textbook publishing business 
477c0311 The two divisions together accounted for about eighty million dollars to ninety million dollars in annual sales said Robert Bernstein Random House chairman 
477c0312 Mr\. Bernstein noted that Random House has expanded in other directions notably in trade publishing 
477c0313 Trade books are all books sold directly to consumers in book stores and through mail orders 
477c0314 A\. Yes without question 
477c0315 It\'s my sense that there was a time when people thought they could trade on inside information with absolute impunity 
477c0316 And that\'s no longer true 
477c0317 Now I am certain that there are still people who think they can trade on inside information and get away with it because they\'re smarter than the average person 
477c0318 There will always be those people 
477c0319 But I think that the actions have had a significant effect on conduct 
477c031a This growing reliance on third parties to sell products could hinder Hewlett Packard\'s ability to manage its business and make the company\'s stock less attractive to investors 
477c031b You bought H\. P\. stock in the past because it had more control over its destiny than other electronics firms Mr\. Wu said 
477c031c Today H\. P\. has less control over its future 
477c031d A spokeswoman for Ashland said We have been outraged by this entire incident 
477c031e Company officials notified federal authorities two years ago that the Iranians had access to the documents and requested a- an investigation 
477c031f Ashland was shocked to learn of Mr\. Atkinson\'s involvement the spokeswoman said 
477c0401 The word is terror 
477c0402 My fear of failure may be greater in some respects 
477c0403 People say adversity is good for you 
477c0404 Well that\'s not exactly true 
477c0405 [tongue_click] I\'m not the same person I was 
477c0406 Trading volume has been lethargic for the past few weeks partly reflecting confusion about the economic outlook 
477c0407 Important clues are expected to emerge Friday when the Labor Department reports employment figures for February 
477c0408 Many analysts expect the statistics to indicate that the economy remains weak and that lower interest rates a- lie ahead 
477c0409 But the employment statistics are very difficult to predict and individual estimates vary widely 
477c040a But some industry analysts are skeptical about S\. H\. V\.\'s intentions 
477c040b There\'s something going on there said Humphrey Harrison an analyst at County Securities 
477c040c I\'m not sure what the end game is but I doubt they S\. H\. V\. will remain at twenty eight \%PERCENT 
477c040d Mr\. Reinhard remembers an Indian commercial two years ago at the prestigious Cannes festival no relation to the film festival there 
477c040e It showed a- a up close of a flatulent elephant\'s backside while an announcer explained the sound in plain language 
477c040f The commercial plugged an antacid for humans 
477c040g It didn\'t win 
477c040h Texaco filed for chapter eleven protection citing the burden of its ten \.POINT three billion dollar legal battle with Pennzoil 
477c040i The bankruptcy law case the largest in history came after both firms apparently remained about two billion dollars apart in settlement talks 
477c040j Though the filing complicates the battle most experts believe neither company will emerge the winner 
477c040k But the oil workers had a candidate too and as the primary drew near strange things started happening in Ebano 
477c040l Neighborhoods with tap water suddenly found themselves cut off 
477c040m Phones rang with death threats 
477c040n The world is made up of optimists and pessimists says Mr\. Stone 
477c040o In this industry in this state they\'re mostly pessimists 
477c040p I may be the last optimist but I\'m sure I\'m right [loud_breath] 
477c040q Local newspapers yesterday said the government may qualify the decision to sign the restructuring agreement 
477c040r But official sources said the signing is likely to take place during the last week in September 
477c040s The signing deadline is October first 
477c040t Art collectors and dealers heaved a sigh of relief last night 
477c040u After high prices and frantic bidding at art auctions last spring about one in four works didn\'t sell at a contemporary art auction at Christie\'s 
477c040v But at least the market didn\'t crash 
477c040w No final budget decisions have been made at the White House 
477c040x Budget drafting is behind schedule and federal agencies won\'t even see O\. M\. B\. recommendations until late this week 
477c040y [lip_smack] But it\'s already clear that the administration has increased its emphasis on education 
477c040z I think it\'s a perfectly honorable profession 
477c0410 [tongue_click] If more of us did it the opportunities would get smaller because more firms would be competing to close the same spreads he says 
477c0411 The product is a legitimate hedging product and a l- legitimate way to add liquidity to the market 
477c0412 [tongue_click] Real estate industry sources said intense friction between Salvatore Ranieri and Mr\. Davis developed duri(ng)- during the Kiawah negotiations 
477c0413 Salvatore Ranieri didn\'t return a reporter\'s telephone call 
477c0414 A spokesman for Mr\. Davis didn\'t dispute the report of personal friction 
477c0415 Banks that commit to the new credit by today get a fee equal to zero \.POINT three seven five \%PERCENT of the amount they commit 
477c0416 It won\'t be clear until after the weekend how many commitments have been received 
477c0417 But some bankers close to the transaction estimate that about eighty \%PERCENT or slightly more than four billion dollars would be committed by early next week 
477c0418 Mr\. Lennane had started the bidding in June by proposing to take the company private for seven \.POINT two five dollars a share 
477c0419 After the board retained Kidder Peabody and Company to review the bid the company met with other potential acquirers 
477c041a In August Mr\. Lennane increased its bid to eight dollars a share 
477c041b Ashton Tate has been plagued by operating losses and management turmoil 
477c041c Last month it reported a nineteen \.POINT eight billion dollar second quarter net loss as well as the resignation of its president and chief operating officer 
477c041d Once a software industry star the company has been buffeted by growing competition in its core database business 
478c0201 [tongue_click] Palo Verde is owned by seven electrical utilities [loud_breath] including Phoenix based A\. Z\. P\. Group Inc\.\'s Arizona Public Service Company 
478c0202 [tongue_click] The plant\'s second unit is already shut down for routine maintenance and isn\'t scheduled to resume operations until early March a spokesman for the operators said 
478c0203 A third Palo Verde unit is under construction 
478c0204 [tongue_click] Carving up the Boesky fund would effectively end Mr\. Boesky\'s involvement in the securities business 
478c0205 [tongue_click] Mr\. Boesky formally has until April first nineteen eighty eight to wind up his affairs under an agreement with the Security and Exchange Commission 
478c0206 [tongue_click] But the Boesky fund has already sold nearly all its stock positions [loud_breath] and a quicker dissolution has appeared likely for some time 
478c0207 It\'s inconceivable that the directorate didn\'t know about Mr\. Rodriguez [loud_breath] comments one international human rights worker who has studied the local refugee situation 
478c0208 The people of El Barillo are under the boot 
478c0209 They\'ve been smart enough to survive

478c020b [tongue_click] In Cleveland Higbee chief executive officer Robert Broadbent says the retailer has benefited from its parent\'s financial expertise 
478c020c Although it will retain control Industrial Equity is planning to take *Higbee* public again probably in June 
478c020d [tongue_click] Meanwhile says Mr\. Broadbent They\'ve made us more inquisitive about acquisitions *ourselves* 
478c020e [tongue_click] Being English and a working class North Londoner at that is a big part of Miss Fox\'s appeal in Britain where class distinction still counts 
478c020f [tongue_click] There\'s nothing patrician about her looks which suits her fans here just fine 
478c020g A lot of young women here look a lot like her 
478c020h Even more sound like her

478c020j [tongue_click] Nevertheless some analysts say [loud_breath] the Fed already may be tightening credit slightly 
478c020k They point to recent increases in the federal funds rate which is the rate on reserves the banks lend each other overnight 
478c020l The funds rate averaged from seven and f- five eighths \%PERCENT yesterday and Tuesday [loud_breath] up from an average of seven \.POINT four three \%PERCENT in the week ended October seventh 
478c020m [tongue_click] These analysts argue that the increase was engineered by the Fed 
478c020n [tongue_click] [loud_breath] Nearly all the gainers were companies that sell to customers other than personal computer makers 
478c020o [tongue_click] Intel the biggest O\. T\. C\. semiconductor maker [loud_breath] and by far the largest electronics issue [misc_noise] on *Nasdaq* fell one quarter to twenty three and three fourths 
478c020p [tongue_click] L\. S\. I\. Logic another big semiconductor concern [loud_breath] with some P\. C\. making customers [loud_breath] was unchanged at seven and three quarters 
478c020q But a raft of smaller electronics issues helped push *the* Nasdaq electronics group average up more than one \%PERCENT 
478c020r Hourly compensation [loud_breath] at nonfinancial firms rose at an annual rate of three \%PERCENT in nominal terms but fell zero \.POINT eight \%PERCENT when adjusted for inflation 
478c020s [tongue_click] Second quarter hourly compensation [loud_breath] rose at an annual nominal rate of two \.POINT six \%PERCENT but fell two \.POINT two \%PERCENT on the inflation adjusted basis

478c020v [lip_smack] [loud_breath] Outdoor organ music blares Lawrence Welk tunes one day as two boys skate along on the ice with hockey sticks 
478c020w [tongue_click] It looks nice doesn\'t it a Shearson official bitterly remarks 
478c020x [tongue_click] Underneath the skating rink is a gymnasium Shearson is trying to sell 
478c020y Market participants say the development doesn\'t bother them 
478c020z [tongue_click] We go through these cycles says John Watson president of the National Security [loud_breath] Traders Association most of whose members are O\. T\. C\. brokers 
478c0210 [tongue_click] There are certain times conducive to bringing out new offerings 
478c0211 [tongue_click] For example there\'s the baffling case of a young child who simply stopped growing for a year and a half 
478c0212 [tongue_click] Doctors couldn\'t identify a medical reason 
478c0213 [tongue_click] The tentative diagnosis here Stress 
478c0214 Sensing the family as whole under pressure the child had become an emotional caretaker to the parents 
478c0215 [tongue_click] The Financial Times [loud_breath] thirty share index fell seventeen \.POINT five points [loud_breath] to fourteen seventy nine \.POINT four 
478c0216 Volume was a light three hundred and sixty six \.POINT four million shares 
478c0217 The hundred share index was off nineteen \.POINT six [loud_breath] at eighteen forty four \.POINT eight 
478c0218 [tongue_click] Warner Lambert [loud_breath] and Schering Plough are coveted for their over the counter drugs as well as for prescription sales 
478c0219 [tongue_click] Over the counter drugs [loud_breath] such as Warner Lambert\'s Listerine mouthwash [loud_breath] are thought to have franchise value 
478c021a They aren\'t research intensive they\'re marketing intensive one analyst said 
478c021b Today Colombians who have stood up overtly to the cocaine gangs remain a minority 
478c021c [tongue_click] Notably among them is Justice Minister Monica de Greiff 
478c021d [tongue_click] She has *intensified* the battle against drug dealers [loud_breath] despite their threat of total war against the government if the current narcotics control drive continues 
478c021e [tongue_click] [loud_breath] Like Ms\. de Greiff s:ome judges have defied the gangsters 
478c021f More than a dozen Justice Department functionaries have been killed this year 
478c021g They include Helena Diaz the Medellin judge who in July refused to revoke arrest warrants issued for reputed Medellin cartel bosses 
478c0301 [tongue_click] The computer also can display a pattern showing how people normally place the tongue to produce [loud_breath] say an s\. sound 
478c0302 [loud_breath] A deaf person can then try to match the pattern by placing the tongue against the electronic palate 
478c0303 [tongue_click] With careful coaching and trial and error children like Miss Gilroy can learn how to make sounds that require placing the tongue against the roof of the mouth 
478c0304 The Bundesbank has refused any further action 
478c0305 [tongue_click] These days it\'s possible to pick up the papers and read about West Germany\'s fears [loud_breath] of *reigniting* inflation 
478c0306 [tongue_click] You have to pinch yourself to remember that the inflation running near zero in April is now running below zero 
478c0307 The E\. M\. S\. apparently [loud_breath] must now be realigned and the franc devalued to accommodate the German taste for deflation 
478c0308 [tongue_click] [loud_breath] But the trade figures could be an even more important influence on interest rates many analysts say 
478c0309 If the January deficit turns out to be significantly larger [loud_breath] than the approximately fourteen billion dollar gap that many analysts expect the dollar might resume its fall 
478c030a [tongue_click] That could alarm foreign investors and discourage them from adding to their holdings of dollar denominated investments 
478c030b There\'s been a complete turnaround in short term sentiment says Thomas G\. Gribbon a senior vice president at Nomura Securities International Inc\. 
478c030c [tongue_click] For weeks people have been trading bearishly on dollar weakness [loud_breath] and a rise in the C\. R\. B\. index 
478c030d [tongue_click] Despite the reversal Investors still are taking a cautious stance and using the latest rally as a selling point he added 
478c030e [tongue_click] At a meeting with analyst Robert M\. Kavner A\. T\. and T\.\'s chief financial officer said It *appears* we will have a good year 
478c030f But in response to an analyst\'s question he said [loud_breath] earnings of two dollars a share sounds strong 
478c030g [tongue_click] He also warned analyst [loud_breath] against looking at a particular quarter and isolating it adding it we are looking for the annual trend line 
478c030h [loud_breath] Mr\. Mechem who held little Taft stock has never been an aggressive chairman 
478c030i [loud_breath] But he had his own long hidden agenda for the company and it bore a surprising similarity to what the Bass team wanted 
478c030j [tongue_click] In May nineteen eighty six Mr\. Mechem invited four Bass representatives onto the Taft board and the Bass team began to engineer a reorganization 
478c030k [tongue_click] Sources say that in the contract talks being held in London Iraqi marketing officials are insisting that two major oil companies already have signed 
478c030l But U\. S\. majors known to be in on the negotiations denied signing contracts [loud_breath] or declined to comment 
478c030m We don\'t see any job in this for a U\. S\. refiner yet says a supply official for one U\. S\. major 
478c030n In Korea label conflicts [loud_breath] have added heat to the unstable political situation 
478c030o The new unions are growing more *adversarial* 
478c030p Companies keep asking the government to smash the unions 
478c030q [tongue_click] But the ruling party can\'t risk alienating workers who will !vote in the coming elections 
478c030r [tongue_click] [loud_breath] It refuses so far to backtrack on its July one promise of greater democracy or to return to the policy of overt union busting 
478c030s [tongue_click] [loud_breath] The Tokyo foreign stock exchange market is closed on Saturdays 
478c030t [tongue_click] [loud_breath] European stock markets were closed Friday and Saturday except Milan where prices edged up in Friday\'s session 
478c030u [tongue_click] [loud_breath] The Milan stock index closed up seven lire at ten sixty six 
478c030v The Japanese firms including ourselves have been good members of the primary dealer community says Toshio Mori chairman of Nikko\'s U\. S\. unit 
478c030w We are not a disturbing force in this market and I don\'t see any advantage in kicking three Japanese firms out from being primary dealers 
478c030x What is the advantage for U\. S\. markets and the U\. S\. economy 
478c030y It has been eleven nights since the arrest of Francis Seow former *solicitor* general and law society president in Singapore 
478c030z While Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew\'s government has admitted holding Mr\. Seow it has kept him totally incommunicado 
478c0310 [tongue_click] It has refused requests to see him from both his family [loud_breath] and his lawyer 
478c0311 But U\. S\. manufacturers who took a beating during the first half of this decade continue to enjoy a roaring revival that began last year 
478c0312 [tongue_click] [loud_breath] As a result there is growing evidence that factory wage and price increases are accelerating 
478c0313 [tongue_click] And that could lead the Fed to boost interest rates in an effort to cool down the economy in the coming months 
478c0314 [tongue_click] On the first day of the general strike factories closed but bookstores remained open in this old world cultural center 
478c0315 Most schools were shut but Pushkin Street near the square reverberated as usual with the sound of barely played Chopin emanating from the open windows of the music academy 
478c0316 Many of the Armenian demands are cultural 
478c0317 [loud_breath] They want the old flag reinstated their children sent to Armenian schools rather than Russian ones their own language used on official documents 
478c0318 Their political demands include calls for a separate army brigade and the right for Armenia to have consulates abroad 
478c0319 Overall consumer spending has slowed since last year\'s stock market crash but it\'s still at a level that worries some economists 
478c031a [tongue_click] Consumer credit slowed sharply in July reflecting sluggish sales 
478c031b [tongue_click] [loud_breath] Too much spending at home coupled with heavy demand for exports could overload an industrial sector [loud_breath] that is already running near capacity 
478c031c Clinical tests of Genentech\'s C\. D\. four in AIDS patients while still at an early stage have run smoothly reports one researcher 
478c031d We haven\'t identified a clinical problem [loud_breath] with this product so far says Samuel Broder director of clinical [loud_breath] oncology at the National Cancer Institute 
478c031e If we do I\'m confident that the scientists [loud_breath] at Genentech can fix it 
478c0401 [tongue_click] [loud_breath] I think they\'re wrong Tennessee Governor Lamar Alexander [loud_breath] the commission chairman said of the opposition 
478c0402 [tongue_click] [loud_breath] He said most of the proposed land use restrictions would be imposed by local governments 
478c0403 [loud_breath] But he conceded that sections of the report on federal lands are being rewritten 
478c0404 [tongue_click] Jewish activist Iosif Begun said he planned to immigrate to Israel 
478c0405 Begun was freed Friday from a Soviet prison [loud_breath] where he had been jailed more than three years for anti state activities 
478c0406 [tongue_click] Separately Israeli officials urged the U\. S\. to deny free entry to Jews who leave the Soviet Union saying they should settle in Israel 
478c0407 [tongue_click] They have put in a lot of money but is that enough 
478c0408 Nobody knows said Mr\. Bray 
478c0409 In October we thought there would be enough but between October and now [loud_breath] it\'s proven to be not enough 
478c040a Who knows how much it will be 
478c040b [tongue_click] [loud_breath] At W\. F\. I\. A\. running the formula last January thirtieth [loud_breath] meant buying more than two hundred thousand shares of Reebok quickly 
478c040c [tongue_click] [loud_breath] That\'s because W\. F\. I\. A\. likes to own all the stocks in the S\. and P\. five hundred index in amounts scaled to their market weight 
478c040d [tongue_click] [loud_breath] Those holdings range from more than one \.POINT four billion dollars of I\. B\. M\. to just six hundred and seventy three thousand dollars of Allis Chalmers Corporation 
478c040e [tongue_click] What this show really is then is an homage to the late Spanish master 
478c040f [tongue_click] If one accepts the show on that basis it is successful despite its gaps 
478c040g In fact the greater work given Miro\'s early paintings [loud_breath] works to advantage here for many of the best pictures were done before the mid nineteen thirties 
478c040h [tongue_click] After that his work was somewhat uneven 
478c040i But Jack Corbett the group\'s interim president says the organization prefers having policy directors with expertise [loud_breath] in aviation 
478c040j [tongue_click] The dues he says [loud_breath] entitle members to several travel assistance services such as a hotline for helping find lost luggage 
478c040k [tongue_click] The group also will lobby for improvement in airline service 
478c040l [tongue_click] We think our background will help us come up with solutions he says 
478c040m [tongue_click] [loud_breath] Asked about a new presidential aid request Jim Wright talked about morality 
478c040n [tongue_click] If I schedule it the President would have some moral responsibility to help pass it he said 
478c040o I don\'t want to run it out there and be defeated again 
478c040p Mr\. Wright should be less timid in his convictions 
478c040q [tongue_click] After all he isn\'t the one who has to risk getting hit [loud_breath] over the head with a metal pipe 
478c040r Pillsbury loss compares with earnings of [loud_breath] forty eight \.POINT five million dollars or fifty six cents a share [loud_breath] in the year earlier quarter 
478c040s [tongue_click] Revenue fell two \%PERCENT in the last period to one \.POINT five billion dollars from one \.POINT five three billion dollars 
478c040t [tongue_click] [loud_breath] The revenue decline came from Pillsbury\'s restaurant business 
478c040u [tongue_click] If Doctor Hammer were to die tomorrow [loud_breath] the check to his foundation would be more than [loud_breath] nineteen million dollars 
478c040v But Occidental and Doctor Hammer apparently don\'t foresee an immediate use of the clause that will benefit the foundation 
478c040w The chairman\'s employment contract runs [loud_breath] at least to February first nineteen ninety eight at which time Doctor Hammer will be ninety nine 
478c040x [tongue_click] After that [loud_breath] the contract automatically extends indefinitely 
478c040y [tongue_click] But General *Pinochet* is more likely to support whichever civilian candidate pledges to retain his anti Communist policies and such a person has a good chance of winning 
478c040z [tongue_click] [loud_breath] Chile a protectionist backwater [loud_breath] in the early nineteen seventies now has dynamic and open export capable economy 
478c0410 Most voters approve of the transformation as shown by the fact that almost none of the sixteen current [loud_breath] opposition parties called for reversal of current economic policies 
478c0411 The Allende chaos is still vividly remembered 
478c0412 Details are still murky about the rest of the credits 
478c0413 Italian officials say that Rome\'s decision to grant about seven hundred and seventy five million dollars [loud_breath] guarantee of export credits was primarily a political rather than a banking decision 
478c0414 Britain\'s Midland Bank has announced plans for a number one billion credit line [loud_breath] though some British banks may be getting cold feet about participating 
478c0415 French banks have yet to announce their plans officially [loud_breath] but are said to be considering loans of two billion dollars 
478c0416 [tongue_click] With the U\. S\. government as its prime customer Tracor was helpless when defense spending slowed 
478c0417 Internally Mr\. Inman says he discovered that expense couldn\'t be cut as easily as bankers had forecast 
478c0418 And fees were higher than expected 
478c0419 Mr\. Inman calls it all part of my education 
478c041a The crack epidemic has just about silenced liberal opposition to tough law and order policies 
478c041b [tongue_click] [loud_breath] It is obviously ridiculous to talk about rehabilitating an Uzi toting drug pusher who makes five thousand dollars a week 
478c041c [tongue_click] His problem is not lack of self esteem 
478c041d There is nothing a social worker is going to be able to do for him [loud_breath] especially since the social worker is too afraid to venture into the neighborhood 
479c0201 At W\. F\. I\. A\. running the formula last January thirty meant buying more than two hundred thousand shares of Reebok quickly 
479c0202 That\'s because W\. F\. I\. A\. likes to own all the stocks in the S\. and P\. five hundred index in amounts scaled to their market weight 
479c0203 [tongue_click] These holdings range from more than w- one \.POINT four billion dollars of I\. B\. M\. to just six hundred and seventy three thousand dollars of Allis Chalmers Corporation 
479c0204 Continental\'s spokesman conceded the airline was slow in some refunds . but he said the problem stemmed from its merger with People Express earlier this year 
479c0205 That carrier had more than twenty five thousand tickets that needed to be refunded when its operations were joined with Continental\'s the spokesman said 
479c0206 He insisted that most of the refunds were completed 
479c0207 General Ramos also confirmed for the first time that Philippine authorities were looking into possible foreign involvement in the coup attempt the Associated Press reported

479c0209 He declined to elaborate 
479c020a A Digital spokesman said the court action doesn\'t change the status quo 
479c020b The part of the ruling that was overturned hasn\'t been in effect since last January when Emulex obtained the stay he said 
479c020c He added that the paragraphs of the order [other_mouth_sound] that were upheld continue to prohibit Emulex from using trade secrets that Digital says were stolen from it 
479c020d [tongue_click] The huge gap to a large extent is a price phenomenon 
479c020e The dollar\'s fall has pushed up the price of imports causing the deficit to swell even as the volume of non oil imports has receded 
479c020f But long before now these higher prices were supposed to lead to improvement in the monthly merchandise trade deficit as well 
479c020g Bids totaling three hundred and seventy six million dollars were submitted 
479c020h Accepted bids ranged from seven \.POINT one five \%PERCENT to seven \.POINT one seven three \%PERCENT 
479c020i The bank holding company slated another fifty million dollar sale next Tuesday 
479c020j But for most mutual fund investors the tax bite this year will be bigger than ever 
479c020k [tongue_click] Holders are taxed on one hundred \%PERCENT of realized capital gains under the new tax law for instance 
479c020l Previously sixty \%PERCENT was excluded from taxation 
479c020m Any gain credited to investors by their fund is considered realized whether the holder actually sells any fund shares or not 
479c020n Articles began appearing about the rise of the religious right . a group that seemed to be dealt with more as anthropology than journalism 
479c020o After watching evangelical T\. V\. ministers Norman Lear began spending his fortune on a group called People for the American Way 
479c020p Much of this swamp creature treatment came to a head in the nineteen seventy six lawsuits over creationism and secular humanism in school text 
479c020q The establishment made virtually no effort to push below the surface of these grievances 
479c020r It\'s a welcome development in the face of a very significant inventory overhang says Morgan Stanley\'s Mr\. Roach 
479c020s A slowing of growth in production gives companies the ability to work off some inventory 
479c020t And economist note that the steady operating rate indicates continued strength in the manufacturing sector 
479c020u Macy is offering seventy seven dollars and thirty cents a share for eighty \%PERCENT of Federated\'s shares plus stock in a combined Federated Macy for the remainder 
479c020v The stock component makes it difficult to determine the value of the total bid which has been widely estimated at about six \.POINT three billion dollars 
479c020w Macy\'s advisers however privately value it between seventy three and seventy four dollars a share or comparable to Campeau\'s proposal 
479c020x The road named West Street is a narrow strip of red gravel 
479c020y It is like the proverbial railroad tracks in America that separate the rich side of town from the poor 
479c020z The physical distance may not be great but the mental gap is 
479c0210 In Taipei there were newspaper reports that the Ministry of Finance turned down a proposal to allow business banks to set up branches in other cities 
479c0211 Trading volume hit a record at five hundred and twenty four million shares compared with four hundred and forty nine million shares in the previous session

479c0216 Stew Leonard who runs Stew Leonard\'s a large grocery store in Norwalk Connecticut accommodated all four of his children this way [other_mouth_sound] 
479c0217 He first named his oldest son president 
479c0218 Then he set up a bakery business in the store for his daughter 
479c0219 For his younger son he created an open air farmer\'s market in Danbury Connecticut where he also is building a supermarket for the son to run 
479c021a And Mr\. Leonard\'s other daughter 
479c021b She became director of the company\'s human resources department 
479c021c Then there\'s been bad luck and bad planning 
479c021d The Volkswagen Fox subcompact was originally brought to the U\. S\. from Brazil in nineteen eighty six as V\. W\.\'s latest attempt to market an entry level car 
479c021e [tongue_click] But rampant Brazilian inflation sent Fox prices soaring and Volkswagen failed to offer an optional automatic transmission 
479c0301 I\'m very nervous because my view on rates is so close to the consensus [other_mouth_sound] . Edward Hyman of Cyrus J\. Lawrence Incorporated says 
479c0302 Remember the consensus is usually wrong 
479c0303 The markets seem determined to make as many economists look as stupid as they possibly can 
479c0304 Defenders of the footnote argue that it makes sense as tax policy 
479c0305 [tongue_click] Why they ask should wealthy best selling authors get substantial tax deferrals while mom and pop manufacturers for example can\'t 
479c0306 As a rule of taxes it\'s a good rule because you don\'t want people taking deductions before they get the income says one congressional aide 
479c0307 It\'s the time value of money principle 
479c0308 A French press report said the exports include sophisticated equipment for making semiconductors 
479c0309 It said the machinery may have helped the Soviets build advanced computer memories for such military purposes as missile guidance 
479c030a Western nations have reached agreements intended to forbid exports of such equipment to the Soviets 
479c030b By September . the weakness of coordinated international efforts to prevent dollar declines . finally surfaced 
479c030c In response to increasing inflation fears Germany and Japan began tightening monetary policy and raising interest rates 
479c030d In untimely fashion Secretary Baker reaffirmed the administration\'s intent to prevent dollar declines 
479c030e In anticipation of the substantial f- Fed tightening that would be necessary to prevent dollar declines U\. S\. interest rates skyrocketed 
479c030f The seeds of market discontent were sown 
479c030g [tongue_click] West Germany is playing for the long term says Pierre Lellouche of the French Institute for Foreign Relations 
479c030h It believes it can get East Germany back [other_mouth_sound] without falling under Soviet domination itself 
479c030i Mr\. Lellouche and most other Frenchmen don\'t think this is possible 
479c030j Market participants say the development doesn\'t bother them 
479c030k We go through these cycles said John Watson president of the National Security Traders Association most of whose members are O\. T\. C\. brokers

479c030m In nineteen eighty six my son died following a second liver transplant

479c030s White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the Reagan administration was preparing to send Congress initial informal notice of the planned sale 
479c030t [tongue_click] Informal notification triggers a twenty day timetable after which the administration would send a formal notice 
479c030u After the formal notice is sent Congress would have thirty days to block the sale 
479c030v The Grand Metropolitan operations which were acquired by that company in nineteen eighty have enjoyed a good reputation in the industry 
479c030w But PepsiCo feels its territories can be better exploited due to their proximity to exisiting company owned bottlers [other_mouth_sound] 
479c030x It owns its Los Angeles and San Francisco bottlers for instance making the central California territory a good fit 
479c030y It also already owns its bottlers in central and northern Florida and parts of Georgia 
479c030z There are some great opportunities to maximize production and marketing efficiencies . the PepsiCo spokesman said 
479c0310 During any repair process blood clots are constantly being formed and dissolved [other_mouth_sound] 
479c0311 [tongue_click] It is quite possible scientists speculate that during attempts to repair the artery wall the body at some point tries to dissolve a blood clot 
479c0312 But it mistakenly grabs protein A\. instead of plasminogen [loud_breath] . pulling it . with its bag of fat and cholesterol into the artery wall 
479c0313 This thwarts the repair process and begins a vicious cycle drawing more and more cholesterol into the damaged area 
479c0314 And in fact microscopic blood clots and bits of L\. P\. A\. [other_mouth_sound] are found in the mishmash of the deposits 
479c0315 However he leaves Prime at a difficult time 
479c0316 The computer market is growing slowly and Prime\'s proprietary systems are losing ground to industry standard computers that use the Unix operating system

479c031b French banks have yet to announce their plans officially but are said to be considering loans of two billion dollars 
479c031c Some banking analysts doubt a London or Tokyo bank would make a similar acquisition anytime here soon 
479c031d Among other things some foreign banks have been shying away from acquiring assets in the U\. S\. [loud_breath] because of unexpectedly high expenses . managing them from afar 
479c031e Instead the trend among foreign banks is to increasingly build alliances with U\. S\. banks

479c0403 The percentage change is since year end 
479c0404 Unlike most eclectic raiders Mr\. Trump has so far stuck to real estate 
479c0405 Resorts has big undeveloped land holdings in Atlantic City 
479c0406 Allegis\' Westin Plaza Hotel which he seems to want could be worth twice as much i- if made into condominiums he says 
479c0407 International Lease Finance Corporation is offering five hundred shares of transferable preferred stock at one hundred thousand dollars each 
479c0408 The shares carry an initial ann:ual dividend rate [loud_breath] of four \.POINT six two five \%PERCENT [other_mouth_sound] 
479c0409 A new rate will be set June eighth and every forty nine days thereafter . through a Dutch auction said Salomon Brothers Incorporated . head underwriter 
479c040a [tongue_click] In a Dutch auction the shares are bought and sold at face value . only the dividend rate is subject to change 
479c040b [tongue_click] International Lease an aircraf:t [other_mouth_sound] leasing company said it will use proceeds for general purposes to acquire aircraft and to retire short term debt 
479c040c The company is based in Beverly Hills California 
479c040d [tongue_click] Critics say the Thai routes are bleeding the airline dry and won\'t ever be profitable 
479c040e And a Hong Kong analyst says Dragonair missed a big chance to improve on its China trade virtually at the carrier\'s inception 
479c040f Cathay originally approached Dragonair he says and [loud_breath] suggested a cooperative arrangement for flights to China 
479c040g The company said Joy Technologies\' projected cash flow from operations [loud_breath] won\'t be sufficient to satisfy its debt obligations [loud_breath] due before June twentieth nineteen eighty nine 
479c040h As a result Joy Technologies will have to sell a number of businesses and assets 
479c040i [lip_smack] The company projected sales in nineteen eighty eight of five hundred and ten million dollars and in nineteen and eighty nine of five hundred eighty seven million dollars 
479c040j Still Mr\. Josephs and others think that the changes will be good for the farm economy in general 
479c040k Many of these gentlemen farmers were tax motivated not profit driven he says 
479c040l Some are unfair competition against the regular farmer [loud_breath] who\'s trying to make a buck 
479c040m Yesterday the agency reversed the nineteen eighty four finding that Meredith had violated the doctrine 
479c040n The so called fairness doctrine is a misnomer said Diane Killory the agency\'s general counsel 
479c040o It promotes blandness and nothingness by chilling the very speech it was meant to foster 
479c040p In some sectors though intriguing options are springing up 
479c040q Investment consultants many of whom work for major brokerages screen money managers for potential clients 
479c040r Several have created limited partnerships that pool the money of investors with similar investment goals 
479c040s Those partnerships are then managed by individual portfolio managers 
479c040t Annual fees for such accounts however often run as high as three \%PERCENT including transaction costs 
479c040u [tongue_click] A hundred and fifty million dollar issue of Household Finance Corporation [other_mouth_sound] seven year notes was offered through underwriters led by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets [other_mouth_sound] 
479c040v The ten \%PERCENT notes were priced at par and the return is oh \.POINT seven two [loud_breath] of a percentage point above the rate on comparable Treasury notes [other_mouth_sound] 
479c040w [tongue_click] The notes are rated double A three by Moody\'s Investors Service Incorporated and double A minus by Standard and Poor\'s Corporation 
479c040x Last month auto sales fell one \.POINT four \%PERCENT after rising five \.POINT seven \%PERCENT in August [other_mouth_sound] 
479c040y Sales of building materials increased one \.POINT two \%PERCENT after a f- oh \.POINT four \%PERCENT drop [other_mouth_sound] 
479c040z Overall sales of durable goods which are intended to last three years or more fell oh \.POINT nine \%PERCENT after rising three \.POINT one \%PERCENT in August 
479c0410 I think the market jumped the gun on the notion of a weak economy and the Fed easing Mr\. Fine said [other_mouth_sound] 
479c0411 So what we\'re seeing now is a consolidation 
479c0412 He expects long term Treasury bond yields to hover around the eight and one half \%PERCENT level in the near future 
479c0413 [tongue_click] Treasurys won\'t resume trading until the Tokyo market opens Monday 
479c0414 [tongue_click] This some analysts say may mean that the London market reaction will be confined [loud_breath] to a brief adjustment at the opening 
479c0415 Nevertheless traders are expected to take neutral positions through the weekend just in case the difficult to forecast data produce a nasty surprise 
479c0416 If Vietnam does withdraw conditions might also [other_mouth_sound] become ripe [loud_breath] for a high level summit between China and the Soviet Union 
479c0417 Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping has repeatedly said that Beijing and Moscow can\'t normalize relations until the Russian backed Vietnamese leave Cambodia 
479c0418 The U\. S\. welcomes a Beijing Moscow thaw which Washington has concluded isn\'t likely to evolve into the kind of strategic alliance they maintained in the nineteen fifties 
479c0419 [lip_smack] The suit charges [loud_breath] that Burger King only allows black franchises to expand one store at a time while whites are allowed to simultaneously open multiple franchises 
479c041a Burger King also makes blacks wait three to four times longer than whites for approval of a new or expansion franchise the suit says 
479c041b The franchisees further allege that Burger King falsely and fraudulently misrepresented <the> the sales potential of their stores 
47ac0201 A spokeswoman for C\. B\. S\. said there are serious issues and we\'re trying our best to find solutions while operating in a very demanding economic climate 
47ac0202 [loud_breath] We\'re continuing to bargain 
47ac0203 Capital Cities \/SLASH A\. B\. C\. declined to comment on the talks 
47ac0204 We had to scour the earth to achieve that settlement Mr\. Liebmann said 
47ac0205 But through it all Ralph was calm and rational 
47ac0206 [loud_breath] He doesn\'t panic when things start to go wrong 
47ac0207 [loud_breath] In a leveraged buyout a group of investors buys a company and takes it private using mostly borrowed funds to finance the transaction 
47ac0208 Cash flow and often asset values are used to pay down the debt 
47ac0209 For investors the appeal is the prospect of a big return when the restructured company is refinanced or sold in a few years 
47ac020a Burlington also has been moving aggressively in court to counter the hostile bid 
47ac020b [loud_breath] Yesterday it filed its second lawsuit against the group and disclosed that it may turn the tables and seek to acquire control of Montreal based Dominion 
47ac020c [loud_breath] The Pac Man defense is named after the video game in which a player tries to gobble up his foe before the player is swallowed 
47ac020d [tongue_click] A\. \:COLON . The press asserts this all the time and I\'m trying to figure out why 
47ac020e I must say I have not yet found that this is going to change the fundamentals of the problem 
47ac020f I mean the European banks have been better reserved than we for a long time 
47ac020g [loud_breath] It hasn\'t seemed to affect the dialogue all that much 
47ac020h Nuclear power remains today fraught with potential for great danger to human life Mr\. Mikva wrote 
47ac020i Congress thus limited the discretion of the commission in carrying out the mandate to ensure adequate protection of the public health and safety 
47ac020j Congress left no room for the commission when operating within this sphere to use cost benefit analysis 
47ac020k Also providing more solace for municipal bond professionals is the fact that commercial banks are becoming more active as underwriters rather than as investors 
47ac020l This means they will need to hire more investment bankers 
47ac020m The banks\' move is part of their effort to test and expand the limits of securities and banking laws 
47ac020n Instead Dayton Hudson\'s earnings have been depressed more than a year by merchandising problems in its Mervyn\'s department store unit 
47ac020o Analysts said the trouble started with Mervyn\'s concentrating too much on opening new stores [loud_breath] and not enough on providing brand name merchandise 
47ac020p Top management was slow to recognize the problems some analysts said 
47ac020q And management has been too optimistic in predicting the timing of a turnaround the analysts said 
47ac020r Wall Street in general has been concerned about G\. M\. in recent weeks because of its new labor contract 
47ac020s The three year pact includes a job security program that prevents layoffs except during a sales drop prevents plant closings and slows attrition 
47ac020t Many analysts predict the provisions will hamper G\. M\.\'s efforts to restructure operations and shed uncompetitive plants particularly in parts operations 
47ac020u [loud_breath] Despite all the uncertainty that surrounded British Petroleum\'s jumbo offering there wasn\'t that much turmoil in the market when shares began to trade Friday 
47ac020v [loud_breath] B\. P\.\'s partially paid American depositary shares closed unchanged at seventeen and a quarter [loud_breath] with thirteen \.POINT two million traded 
47ac020w It was the Big Board\'s most active issue 
47ac020x Juan Caldera a sixty two year old agricultural worker from Ciudad Juarez Chihuahua is outside Freddy\'s at one a\. m\. looking for his employer 
47ac020y [tongue_click] For his amnesty application Mr\. Caldera needs the boss\'s signature to help prove that he has worked in the fields for at least ninety days 
47ac020z Actually Mr\. Caldera has worked in the fields for almost thirty years 
47ac0210 The Cuomo plan doesn\'t stop at gouging New York taxpayers and Long Island ratepayers 
47ac0211 Federal taxpayers also will contribute 
47ac0212 [loud_breath] The key to the deal is that Lilco also would get a two \.POINT five billion dollar tax write off for Shoreham 
47ac0213 This would guarantee that the utility won\'t have to pay any federal taxes for at least a decade 
47ac0214 New York would also help Lilco float one hundred million dollars in tax exempt industrial development bonds to help pay for the cleanup 
47ac0215 Make that de industrialization bonds 
47ac0216 But Mr\. Peterson says there still is an image problem 
47ac0217 If we haven\'t worked with a company before the natural reaction is Why the hell are you bringing in accountants to work in the plant 
47ac0218 Yet we probably have the largest manufacturing consulting practice in the world 
47ac0219 The reason for the relatively modest incentive programs is that the auto makers are demonstrating a much better ability to keep production in line with sales 
47ac021a Inventories of U\. S\. made cars stood at fifty nine days supply at the end of August according to Ward\'s Automotive Reports an industry trade publication 
47ac021b [loud_breath] That is considered a normal supply and it is the lowest stock in twenty two months 
47ac021c Not all black colleges are on the ropes 
47ac021d In fact a number of elite institutions are thriving in part because of their highly successful fund raising efforts 
47ac021e Last week for instance Mr\. Cosby and his wife Camille donated twenty million dollars to Spelman College a black women\'s college in Atlanta 
47ac0301 Borg Warner eased three eighths to forty one and three eighths on six hundred thirty nine thousand eight hundred shares 
47ac0302 Minstar and Bear Stearns entered into an option agreement for the possible purchase of three million twenty nine thousand two hundred Borg Warner shares 
47ac0303 The purchases would boost Minstar\'s Borg Warner stake to eight \.POINT five \%PERCENT 
47ac0304 Yesterday G\. A\. F\. announced that it has required [loud_breath] nine \.POINT nine six \%PERCENT investment stake in Borg Warner 
47ac0305 Last month Piedmont\'s board recommended that the company accept n- Norfolk Southern\'s bid to acquire the company for sixty five dollars a share 
47ac0306 Norfolk Southern has had a stake in Piedmont since nineteen eighty one 
47ac0307 But one day after the board\'s recommendation U\. S\. Air sweetened its initial bid for Piedmont forcing the board to drop its recommendation 
47ac0308 In fact given the highly developed U\. S\. transportation infrastructure few if any shippers are truly captive to rails 
47ac0309 The best case is made by electric utilities that have power plants served by coal hauling roads but big utilities don\'t lack bargaining power 
47ac030a For one thing the Staggers Act now allows long term contracts between shippers and railroads 
47ac030b That incredibly was not allowed under the old law because Congress had once decided that volume discounts to big shippers were unfair 
47ac030c In drawing up contracts the relevant fact is that both the railroad and the utility need each other 
47ac030d Some utilities particularly in the West have surplus capacity meaning they can switch to other sources if hauling costs at a single plant rise 
47ac030e [tongue_click] During testimony in April Federal Trade Commission Chairman Daniel Oliver said the legislation would restrain competition 
47ac030f He argued that selling drugs poses no conflict of interest for physicians 
47ac030g The commission also has urged state legislatures to oppose similar measures 
47ac030h When the market was roaring it was stupid to have cash says the fund manager at a major Japanese trust bank 
47ac030i But now it isn\'t so bad 
47ac030j And Mr\. Salomon\'s Mr\. Napier says Everyone is getting into cash right now and waiting 
47ac030k Bond traders were also cheered by another drop in oil futures prices the seventh decline in the past eight sessions 
47ac030l The drop has indicated to some analysts that inflation fears were greatly exaggerated 
47ac030m Previously oil prices had surged above twenty two dollars a barrel largely on fear that growing tension in the Persian Gulf [loud_breath] might lead to a s- disruption of oil supplies 
47ac030n [loud_breath] It also increases the likelihood of defections from Hill Samuel\'s one hundred thirty member corporate finance group [loud_breath] according to insiders and officials of other banks 
47ac030o As part of T\. S\. B\. the department mainly would serve small companies in the United Kingdom 
47ac030p Many members of the team had sought an alliance with a larger global partner 
47ac030q Until the last minute they had thought the operation would be sold to Barclays Bank P\. L\. C\. 
47ac030r Protesters in Bangladesh fought police and political opponents after voting resumed in local elections 
47ac030s Four people were reported killed and more than one hundred were injured 
47ac030t The voting for local council seats began February tenth but election a- violence killed at least one hundred people and officials postponed the balloting 
47ac030u [loud_breath] Voting had resumed on Saturday 
47ac030v The government is now poring over Seow\'s financial affairs asking how he\'s been paying his phone bills these past ten years 
47ac030w Similar inquiries led to the expulsion from Parliament last December of Joshua B\. Jeyaretnam leaving only one opposition M\. P\. 
47ac030x [loud_breath] A team candidate proposal now under study would also seem likely to keep the opposition from finding its way into government office 
47ac030y But Singapore\'s two \.POINT six million citizens aren\'t likely to benefit quite so much as the politicians of Mr\. Lee\'s ruling party 
47ac030z Cotton Futures prices for cotton from the current crop rose on buying mostly by traders who follow chart signals 
47ac0310 The advance in turn pulled up prices of delivery months representing the new crop season which will begin August the first 
47ac0311 The July delivery rose one \.POINT fifty nine cents a pound to sixty four \.POINT forty eight cents 
47ac0312 The October contract was up zero \.POINT fifty eight cent to sixty \.POINT thirty six cents a pound 
47ac0313 One analyst observed that new crop contracts were under pressure earlier in the day because of the perception that moisture in the Mississippi Delta might be heavier than needed 
47ac0314 But later in the session traders changed their minds he said deciding that rain might not be adequate 
47ac0315 He scored a big triumph early this year pushing aside local bureaucrats who wanted to share his spoils in a one billion dollar freeway being built in Guangdong province 
47ac0316 His weapon the personal blessing of Communist Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang 
47ac0317 At the April opening of the f:ive hundred twelve \.POINT eight million dollar Guangdong power plant officialdom heaped praise on Mr\. Wu for beating a construction deadline 
47ac0318 Indonesia and the Philippines are so impressed that they have asked him to build similar plants 
47ac0319 Many admirers believe firmly that if anyone can get business done in China Mr\. Wu can 
47ac031a To begin with companies have been doing a good job of managing inventories 
47ac031b In the past businesses have tended to become increasingly optimistic as expansions persisted 
47ac031c When sales eventually slowed inventories quickly reached excessive levels 
47ac031d Companies thereupon cut their buying industrial production declined and a recession was under way 
47ac031e One of the affinity cards that Chemical Bank dropped was marketed to el- alumni of New York University 
47ac031f We were satisfied with the program while it was running says Robert Cunningham director of alumni relations at N\. Y\. U\. 
47ac031g [loud_breath] But it ended at Chemical\'s suggestion 
47ac0401 [tongue_click] Occidental officals say the mine will start commercial operations next September more than two years behind schedule [other_mouth_sound] 
47ac0402 [tongue_click] The mine is expected to produce between w- thirteen million and thirteen \.POINT five million tons of steaming coal annually used at electric generating plants says Mr\. Ogden 
47ac0403 All but ten \%PERCENT of the output is for export mostly to Japan South Korea and Hong Kong 
47ac0404 So far illegal foreign workers aren\'t taken as a job threat by Japanese workers 
47ac0405 But Japanese unemployment is at historically high levels because of the yen\'s strength posing a knotty problem for the government 
47ac0406 Many Japanese companies in such industries as steel and shipbuilding are cutting their labor forces 
47ac0407 Brokerage stocks have been wilting for months but Mr\. Chanos thinks they could get hit later this year if other firms report down quarters 
47ac0408 Salomon\'s stock dived eleven \%PERCENT on huge volume Monday casting a temporary pall over the whole group 
47ac0409 It closed yesterday at thirty nine and seven eighths up one eighth 
47ac040a The Broderick men are attracted to Leah because she is an honest woman in a world of pretense and artifice 
47ac040b [tongue_click] She can manipulate ideology and image to further radical causes but she doesn\'t confuse her political stratagems with reality 
47ac040c [loud_breath] Indeed she has no personal devotion to those causes they are simply vehicles for her professional skills 
47ac040d This fascinates and baffles the men around her 
47ac040e Another reason Mr\. Soifer is avoiding Morgan and Citicorp is that their stock prices at times have tended to gyrate more violently than other bank issues 
47ac040f Citicorp and Morgan tend to have more volatility on days when program trading is known to occur Mr\. Soifer says 
47ac040g They\'re more of a bet on which way the market is headed 
47ac040h [loud_breath] Although OPEC has toyed with voluntary quotas for several years it really didn\'t become serious about production curbs until after last year\'s collapse in oil prices 
47ac040i [loud_breath] Member countries continue to argue however over the fairness of their nineteen eighty seven quotas and each has reason to report less than it is producing 
47ac040j [loud_breath] The problem says a senior OPEC official is that rigid quotas are incompatible with a flexible oil market [sniff] 
47ac040k With one ear Laura Sloate listens to a man reading headlines from six newspapers 
47ac040l [loud_breath] With the other ear she monitors an aide reading her mail 
47ac040m Meanwhile she is keeping up a conversation sort of 
47ac040n Correspondent banking or providing services to smaller banks is one area that Manufacturers might leave 
47ac040o [loud_breath] The profitability of that business has been declining for years Mr\. Wooden said 
47ac040p [loud_breath] It was through these correspondent banks that Manufacturers got all of these energy loans that have soured 
47ac040q However one Manufacturers executive said he doubted correspondent banking would be eliminated in light of that business\'s improved performance recently 
47ac040r The point a point Mr\. Campbell keeps returning to is that every religion is true 
47ac040s [loud_breath] It\'s true as a metaphor for the human and cosmic mysteries 
47ac040t It\'s only when you\'re stuck on the metaphor that you get in trouble 
47ac040u Mr\. Smith said trading in British Aerospace shares would resume early today on London\'s stock exchange 
47ac040v Trading was suspended at four hundred seventy pence or seven dollars ninety f:ive cents Wednesday 
47ac040w Analysts predicted early yesterday that the shares would fall when trading resumed whatever the outcome of negotiations between the E\. C\. [loud_breath] and British government 
47ac040x Processors blame their suppliers 
47ac040y Cargill Incorporated a major corn syrup maker says it is paying cooperatives farmers and elevators more for their corn 
47ac040z [loud_breath] A spokesman says sellers know they can go to other buyers 
47ac0410 We don\'t have any growers in our pocket 
47ac0411 Cargill can\'t set prices 
47ac0412 As for the prices Cargill charges he adds We\'re trying to get the maximum price for our products all the time 
47ac0413 Viewers and critics say the huge load of ads and airtime is part of the problem 
47ac0414 Commercial clutter seems greater than in previous Olympics broadcasts many critics say 
47ac0415 The coverage between ads some complain is fragmented and shifty jumping too quickly among myriad sports 
47ac0416 Actual events as opposed to taped profiles previews and reports take up less than half of the airtime 
47ac0417 Many headline events don\'t appear until after midnight 
47ac0418 [tongue_click] [loud_breath] In Philips Sun has won a European ally that it hopes will provide an edge over competitors 
47ac0419 Motorola Incorporated M\. I\. P\. S\. Computer Systems Incorporated and Hewlett Packard Company are jockeying to woo computer makers to their own R\. I\. S\. C\. [other_mouth_sound] chips 
47ac041a The chips are rapidly gaining popularity among computer makers and the one that gets the most converts could become a de facto standard in tomorrow\'s computer industry 
47ac041b [tongue_click] The Senate Judiciary Committee on a seven to seven vote last month effectively killed Mr\. Lucas\'s nomination to head the department\'s civil rights division 
47ac041c A majority was needed to send the nomination to the full Senate 
47ac041d Democratic members of the committee criticized President Bush and Mr\. Thornburgh for nominating Mr\. Lucas who has little experience as a lawyer and none as a civil rights litigator 
47bc0201 [loud_breath] The lack of market depth yesterday enabled several large buy orders to spark the dollar rally 
47bc0202 [loud_breath] One New York trader said he witnessed the currency\'s value jump as his bank executed a purchase order for two hundred and fifty million dollars in several chunks 
47bc0203 When there are very few players that kind of order will move the market said the trader who asked not to be identified 
47bc0204 I was startled startled isn\'t the word reacted Alvin Novick a biology professor at Yale University 
47bc0205 [tongue_click] He warned that forced testing such as contemplated by the centers would drive homosexuals underground and away from cooperation with public health programs 
47bc0206 Rational people won\'t cooperate in ruining their own lives he said 
47bc0207 He also is focusing on El Herald 
47bc0208 With only two news reporters and a desk of translators it lacks vitality readers say 
47bc0209 Mr\. Castillo wants to expand the section and sell it as an independent paper 
47bc020a He will begin testing stand alone sales this month 
47bc020b He had a point 
47bc020c Vitaly Yurchenko of the K\. G\. B\. the man who had told the F\. B\. I\. of a spy code named Mr\. 
47bc020d Long had by this time defected back to the Soviet Union and was in Moscow 
47bc020e And Mr\. Pelton hadn\'t stolen any National Securi:ty Agency documents to give the Soviets 
47bc020f Other entrants offer such pen names as Granny Mr\. Discussion Anna Darling Dear John and Bea Ready 
47bc020g I suggest a hip macho name with quick reader identification Stan Landers 
47bc020h I can picture my readers in a bar after work Hey did you read Stan The Man Landers this morning 
47bc020i That guy gives great advice 
47bc020j [tongue_click] Richard Stein executive vice president finance at Worlds of Wonder said the stock probably was moving down in sympathy with other toy companies 
47bc020k However he said We are one of the few toy companies that expect an up fourth quarter 
47bc020l He said the company is exceeding expectations in sales of Teddy Ruxpin its talking teddy bear and of Laser Tag an infrared gun game 
47bc020m Sounds good but what\'s the catch 
47bc020n Mr\. Leming a chemicals analyst issued his report June twenty second with Seagram trading at seventy seven 
47bc020o [tongue_click] It closed yesterday at seventy six and three eighths up one and seven eighths 
47bc020p This reasoning has clearly failed to galvanize the market 
47bc020q [loud_breath] Mr\. Leming didn\'t return calls seeking comment yesterday 
47bc020r Analysts also said they hadn\'t expected lower operating profits for the company\'s Industries Group [loud_breath] and for the broadcasting segment 
47bc020s Westinghouse officials told analysts that operating profit in the Industries Group fell fifteen \%PERCENT to twenty \%PERCENT hurt in part by weak results in Canadian operations 
47bc020t A sharp drop in operating profit from the Broadcasting Group\'s production company contributed to the slightly lower operating earnings overall for that segment 
47bc020u Pizza Hut for example is developing an economy pie and has introduced several gourmet pizzas 
47bc020v [loud_breath] Godfather\'s has introduced a less expensive thin crusted pie used in its two for one specials 
47bc020w It developed the economy line because we didn\'t want to cannibalize our premium product sales Mr\. Henderson says 
47bc020x Mr\. Forbes said he\'d had no communication with anyone from the I\. R\. S\. trying to dissuade him from publishing such a story 
47bc020y [loud_breath] I assure you that Forbes doesn\'t kill stories at the request of the I\. R\. S\. or anyone else he said 
47bc020z [tongue_click] Indeed he added Such a call would almost ensure the appearance of such a story 
47bc0210 [loud_breath] Mr\. Forbes also said he would be hard put to think of the commissioner\'s name 
47bc0211 However the long siege of corporate cost cutting has already slashed corporate payrolls so severely that many companies have significantly reduced their break even levels of operations 
47bc0212 In effect they already are operating as if in a recession so layoffs might prove relatively modest 
47bc0213 In addition the role of manufacturing in the economy has faded in comparison with the growth of a recession resistant service jobs 
47bc0214 [loud_breath] In most modern nations it\'s not considered a threat to national security when critics of the government decide to run for political office 
47bc0215 Nor is it subversive to embarrass the prime minister and his administration 
47bc0216 [throat_clear] [loud_breath] Sad to say in Singapore this seems reason enough to invoke the Internal Security Act 
47bc0217 [loud_breath] With every new bout of government panic it becomes clearer that the real foreign elements Mr\. Lee fears are his critics in Singapore 
47bc0218 Many lawmakers believe it is their duty to bring home the bacon and they have trouble understanding why anyone would think otherwise 
47bc0219 [tongue_click] Pork barreling has gotten a bad name says Representative Douglas Bosco a California Democrat 
47bc021a [loud_breath] That\'s what I\'m here for 
47bc021b It turns out to be one of the few tangible things we can do in Congress 
47bc021c A possible backlash by English speaking Canadians could be the biggest obstacle 
47bc021d [loud_breath] There\'s no way I can sell that keyboard to customers in Vancouver says the representative of a U\. S\. computer maker 
47bc021e [loud_breath] They will continue to use the standard American keyboard 
47bc021f She expects the keyboard to gain acceptance only with the federal and Quebec governments 
47bc0301 [loud_breath] The biggest danger economists say is a free fall of the dollar 
47bc0302 [loud_breath] That would force the U\. S\. to raise interest rates to attract the foreign capital needed to finance its current account deficit and indirectly its budget deficit 
47bc0303 Higher rates in turn could plunge the U\. S\. and possibly the world [loud_breath] into a recession that could threaten the international financial system

47bc0305 Some fear a takeover of the military subcontractor could hurt national security

47bc0307 The new government has started to lower personal income taxes and at the same time it has begun to bring its own spending under control 
47bc0308 [loud_breath] In the nineteen eighty seven budget the highest rate of income tax was lowered [loud_breath] to fifty eight \%PERCENT from sixty five \%PERCENT 
47bc0309 [loud_breath] This is part of a world wide movement that France must follow to keep its most energetic aggressive and bright young people and to attract investors 
47bc030a Federal Reserve Board spokesman Joseph Coyne said yesterday\'s action was done entirely at Citicorp\'s initiative 
47bc030b [loud_breath] Although Fed officials were advised of the bank\'s plans it was their own judgment of what kind of reserve positions they should make Mr\. Coyne said

47bc030e [loud_breath] It also will retain smaller Ford accounts in six other countries [loud_breath] and it continues to be Ford\'s largest agency 
47bc030f But industry sources said they believed Ford was considering giving one of those six accounts for Ford\'s Latin American affiliate to another agency 
47bc030g But John Smale P\. and G\'s chairman and chief executive used the meeting to speak at length about hostile takeovers in general 
47bc030h He maintained that too often they leave companies loaded with debt and shrunken research budgets and ignore the interests of employees and the communities in which the companies do business 
47bc030i [loud_breath] He also argued that over the long run hostile takeovers don\'t necessarily provide a good mechanism for shareholders to realize full value for their shares 
47bc030j Khrushchev saw party activism as a key to bringing his ambitions to fruition particularly in the rural sector 
47bc030k Rather than offer workers increased m- material incentives he mobilized local party officials to coax farmers and workers to produce more

47bc030r Officials at the company say ChemLawn didn\'t belong on the agenda under pending acquisitions in the first place 
47bc030s [footsteps] A federal district court and an appeals court both in Richmond upheld the plan 
47bc030t But in nineteen eighty six the Supreme Court told the appeals court to reconsider its decision in light of another high court ruling 
47bc030u Last July the appeals court struck down the plan ruling that affirmative action must be based on evidence that the city itself had discriminated in the past 
47bc030v [tongue_click] Past societal bias isn\'t sufficient basis to justify the plan the appeals court said in an opinion written by Judge [loud_breath] J\. Harvie Wilkinson the third

47bc030z For two years after his nineteen eighty one election he put into effect the Socialist program of fast reflation and wholesale nationalization 
47bc0310 As inflation soared and the franc nose dived his approval rating plunged 
47bc0311 [loud_breath] Then he changed course completely 
47bc0312 [loud_breath] His nineteen eighty three austerity program was applauded by even his right wing opponents 
47bc0313 [loud_breath] After naming four Communists to his original cabinet he broke with the Communists in nineteen eighty four [loud_breath] and destroyed them as a political force 
47bc0314 Other large and midsized cars posting good scores were the Mercury Sable the Oldsmobile Delta eighty eight and the Buick Regal 
47bc0315 [tongue_click] Three cars in the category performed poorly posting scores above one thousand for the driver\'s side 
47bc0316 They were the Buick Park Avenue the Chrysler New Yorker and the Renault Medallion

47bc0318 Mr\. Icahn wants to give holders a mixture of twenty dollars a share in cash and about thirty dollars a share face amount of debentures 
47bc0319 On some ledgers that might seem to add to up to fifty dollars 
47bc031a But some insiders apparently prefer thirty six dollars to thirty eight dollars in cash 
47bc031b [tongue_click] Four T\. W\. A\. vice presidents three current one departed recently sold all their shares at those prices 
47bc031c The Treasury attributed the decline to unusually strong sales of bonds in October nineteen eighty six the first month of fiscal nineteen eighty seven 
47bc031d Bonds sold that month were the last to carry a minimum seven \.POINT five \%PERCENT interest rate 
47bc031e The rate fell to six \%PERCENT in November nineteen eighty six 
47bc0401 To many observers the site will be a bonanza for whoever develops it 
47bc0402 It\'s one of the finest pieces of land that you can find says Sanford Goodkin a Marina del Rey California housing consultant

47bc0404 Adds Rob Maguire at Maguire Thomas Partners a Los Angeles based office developer It\'s a terrific location 
47bc0405 [loud_breath] The department also said that productivity for nonfinancial companies increased at a three tenths \%PERCENT annual rate in the third quarter a preliminary estimate 
47bc0406 [tongue_click] The estimate is based on an increase in output of one \.POINT four \%PERCENT and an increase in hours worked of one \.POINT one \%PERCENT 
47bc0407 This was the first quarter in which productivity increased in the nonfinancial sector since the third quarter of nineteen eighty five 
47bc0408 [loud_breath] But neither Europeans nor Americans seem especially eager 
47bc0409 Some even contend that conventional defenses are adequate or are growing irrelevant 
47bc040a [loud_breath] Not so insists Mr\. Abshire who believes enhancing NATO\'s capabilities [loud_breath] is of accelerating importance 
47bc040b As been the case in recent quarters the company\'s actual results were masked by several special charges 
47bc040c Before a six million dollar loss from discontinued operations Phillips had profit from continuing operations of seventeen million dollars or five cents a share 
47bc040d [loud_breath] That profit included a twelve million dollar gain from asset sales [loud_breath] and an eight million dollar charge from staff reductions 
47bc040e Much of the litigation involving business brokers centers on the larger better staffed concerns concerns like Business Buyers 
47bc040f That company which exclusively represents buyers says it has signed more than two hundred fifty clients since it opened in nineteen eighty two 
47bc040g Most are corporate executives in late forties who paid the firm up to a twenty five thousand dollar retainer fee 
47bc040h U\. S\. lawmakers who are sympathetic to Israel are expected to react to the report by publicly praising Israel for its recent steps 
47bc040i However these legislators are worried about the details that might be included in the report 
47bc040j Also since military contracts between Jerusalem and Pretoria are secret and it isn\'t known whether the pacts contain renewal clauses it will be difficult to monitor Israeli compliance

47bc040l So our William McGurn inquired into how many have been exported from Korea to Japan 
47bc040m [loud_breath] He found that in nineteen eighty six the number was zero 
47bc040n This was down from nineteen eighty five when exports reached one sold to Mit:subishi 
47bc040o To do the job S\. C\. I\. has assembled what analysts call a crack management team 
47bc040p President Eugene Sapp runs the company on a day to day basis and he does so in a no frills atmosphere 
47bc040q For example company cars planes and country club memberships are taboo 
47bc040r [tongue_click] On Friday Shearson Lehman Brothers Incorporated said it is ceasing program trading for its own account 
47bc040s We don\'t want to be part of the problem said Jeffrey Lane president of Shearson 
47bc040t Mr\. Lane said he would rather see Wall Street modify its behavior than have Washington regulators clamp down 
47bc040u We\'re giving up short term gains for the good of our clients he asserted 
47bc040v [throat_clear] I think it\'s a perfectly honorable profession 
47bc040w If more of us did it the opportunities would get smaller because more firms would be competing to close the same spreads he said 
47bc040x [loud_breath] The product is a legitimate hedging product and a legitimate way to add liquidity to the market 
47bc040y Unlike traditional whole life policies in which the premium and death benefit are fixed universal life gives holders considerable latitude to vary their payments and benefits 
47bc040z [tongue_click] But it has limited guarantees and much investment risk is transferred to the holder 
47bc0410 [loud_breath] Premium dollars are invested in the saving portion of the plan and money is deducted periodically to pay for administrative expenses and the insurance coverage 
47bc0411 Prices at the mass retail level however haven\'t risen much in a decade partly because big retailers use tennis balls to lure shoppers 
47bc0412 I remember purchasing a can of balls for two dollars in nineteen sixty seven says Walter L\. Henry a Pittsburgh . recreational player 
47bc0413 [loud_breath] Two weeks ago I picked up a can for a dollar eighty nine cents 
47bc0414 [loud_breath] David Meister F\. N\. N\.\'s president acknowledged the company has been in discussions with other media concerns but he declined to identify them 
47bc0415 We\'ve spoken to virtually every company you can imagine plus a half dozen more you wouldn\'t think of Mr\. Meister said 
47bc0416 He denied industry speculation that F\. N\. N\. is looking to sell the company 
47bc0417 [tongue_click] We\'re not interested in selling and we\'re not soliciting anything he said 
47bc0418 However he added that\'s not to say we wouldn\'t entertain any reasonable offer for at least a piece of F\. N\. N\. 
47bc0419 [loud_breath] Peter DaPuzzo head of retail trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton also looks for a sharp upward move in stock prices given a few ifs 
47bc041a One is if investors don\'t get spooked at the anniversary of the crash 
47bc041b [loud_breath] Another is if the Federal Reserve eases interest rates 
47bc041c [loud_breath] And a third is if George Bush wins the presidential election 
47bc041d [loud_breath] Food buyers for one Texas supermarket chain Furr\'s Incorporated have even asked five hundred dollars just to make an appointment according to one manufacturer 
47bc041e I just laughed said the sales manager of a Southern California candy company who refused the demand 
47bc041f Furr\'s wouldn\'t confirm or deny the claim 
47cc0201 How is Wall Street reacting to the changes 
47cc0202 Some investment bankers feel threatened [loud_breath] by it others scoff at suggestion that these efforts are truly competitive 
47cc0203 But some say the case isn\'t clear 
47cc0204 Few developers are big enough to justify the cost of these divisions 
47cc0205 The test will be whether the new units are adding value to their organizations 
47cc0206 If not one investment banker says the partners will kill them 
47cc0207 Some were quite vehement in resisting any change 
47cc0208 If a company did this I wouldn\'t follow them anymore said one New York analyst 
47cc0209 Issuers of abbreviated annual reports are really showing contempt for the typical shareholder said another 
47cc020a One North Korean assertion does have a certain scary credibility to it 
47cc020b North Korea says that blowing up an expensive dam to flood the South would be a waste of good explosives 
47cc020c To do the job would take a blast equivalent to a nuclear bomb 
47cc020d Better to drop it directly on Seoul 
47cc020e That would be a hundred times better in destructive effect says Li Choong Sung the vice chairman of the North Korean power commission

47cc020p Some wonder whether all the conversions don\'t make Mr\. Beregovoy more of an opportunist than a believer in the market economy [door_slam] 
47cc020q But his aides say he was convinced that he was doing the right thing 
47cc020r Mr\. Beregovoy said I\'m not ashamed of what I do 
47cc020s Mr\. Giordano of Goldman Sachs partly agrees 
47cc020t If investors saw the world like I see the world they\'d be in a defensive portfolio position he said

47cc020y Wells Fargo\'s arrival was announced in a memo to First RepublicBank employees yesterday by Albert V\. Casey its chairman and chief executive officer 
47cc020z He told employees that the F\. D\. I\. C\. asked us to allow a delegation from Wells Fargo to examine the bank 
47cc0210 We shall fully cooperate with their contingent 
47cc0211 He also said that bank regulators are seeking additional information [loud_breath] from the Texas bank about its own recapitalization plan

47cc0216 Overall consumer spending has slowed since last year\'s stock market crash [loud_breath] but it\'s still at a level that worries some economists 
47cc0217 Consumer credit slowed sharply in July reflecting sluggish [door_slam] sales 
47cc0218 Too much spending at home coupled with heavy demand for exports could overload an industrial sector that is already running near capacity 
47cc0219 Some banking analysts doubt a London or Tokyo bank would make a similar acquisition anytime here soon 
47cc021a Among other things some foreign banks have been shying away from acquiring assets in the U\. S\. because of unexpectedly high [loud_breath] expenses managing them from afar 
47cc021b Instead the trend among foreign banks is to increasingly build alliances with U\. S\. banks 
47cc021c Their infant son was admitted to a hospital critically ill and was misdiagnosed as an abuse victim

47cc030q He is now fifty years old and this mid career retrospective [loud_breath] at the Los Angeles County Museum makes clear once again how precocious and prolific he has been 
47cc030r In fact the profusion and variety of Mr\. Hockney\'s work seems to have given the show\'s organizers some problems with its presentation 
47cc030s [tongue_click] For although Mr\. Hockney\'s talent and originality are generally acknowledged he is regarded in some quarters as more of a gifted illustrator than a major artist

47dc0208 [loud_breath] Some guys I know back in Barrington Illinois keep just two or three horses and have a lot of fun 
47dc0209 Here in Palm Beach though it takes a bit more 
47dc020a After much conflict Secretary of State Cyrus Vance struck a deal in nineteen seventy seven 
47dc020b Each embassy complex had to be occupied simultaneously 
47dc020c [tongue_click] Construction of the Soviet Union\'s Washington Embassy was completed by nineteen seventy nine [loud_breath] before work on the U\. S\.\'s new Moscow Embassy had even started 
47dc020d The Soviets then pushed to occupy their new site but the U\. S\. resisted until its own buildings were ready 
47dc020e As the U\. S\. buildings were completed in Moscow [loud_breath] the Soviets were allowed to move into some of their new facilities on Mount Alto 
47dc020f Only the main ambassadorial buildings at each site are vacant 
47dc020g It\'s inconceivable that the directorate didn\'t know about Mr\. Rodriguez comments one international human rights worker who has studied the local refugee situation 
47dc020h The people of El Barillo are under the boot 
47dc020i They\'ve been smart enough to survive 
47dc020j They\'ve adapted 
47dc020k [tongue_click] Grains and Soybeans Prices were mixed amid resistance to trading in tandem with foreign currencies and metals 
47dc020l Lack of farmer selling and fears of a hot dry summer boosted soybean futures 
47dc020m [loud_breath] The strength in the soybean contract for delivery after the harvest helped September corn rise slightly as did worries about the summer weather 
47dc020n [loud_breath] Wheat futures were mixed 
47dc020o [tongue_click] Mr\. Holmes a Court also filed with the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission seeking clearance to boost his stake above ten \%PERCENT 
47dc020p Such a filing is required under antitrust law if an investor wishes to increase his holdings above that level 
47dc020q [tongue_click] If his request is granted he and his group could buy as much as fifteen \%PERCENT of Texaco 
47dc020r A purchase of more than fifteen \%PERCENT would require another filing with the agencies 
47dc020s He helped us to look at the different options says Alfred S\. Warren the G\. M\. vice president leading the negotiations under Mr\. Johnson 
47dc020t He was very refreshing in some of his thoughts and ideas 
47dc020u But the ideas never became reality 
47dc020v G\. M\. eventually signed a traditional pact patterned closely after Ford\'s 
47dc020w In a recent paper presented to fellow lobbyists Miss Farthing explained how to get leverage from such a program 
47dc020x She recommended sending invitations first to members of tax writing committees and to senior opinion molders who lobby their colleagues 
47dc020y [tongue_click] She also suggested sending a car to fetch the lawmaker whose goodwill you wish to stimulate and making sure that the check is issued promptly 
47dc020z [tongue_click] Separately Wall Street speculation grew that media investor Rupert Murdoch was considering acquiring a stake in London based W\. P\. P\. 
47dc0210 [loud_breath] A Murdoch aide said that Mr\. Murdoch has been looking for a long time at the company 
47dc0211 But a W\. P\. P\. spokesman said that there has been no contact and there has been no acquisition of W\. P\. P\. shares by Murdoch 
47dc0212 State workers are another constituency 
47dc0213 One in four working Panamanians owes his livelihood to the government and the general expects help from all of them 
47dc0214 [loud_breath] Down the street from Mr\. Sanchez\'s shop Carlos a government mechanic says he goes to many pro Noriega demonstrations 
47dc0215 Chase previously announced the sale of its computer services company Interactive Data Corporation and offices in Paris 
47dc0216 [loud_breath] Among other assets Chase is considering for sale is One New York Plaza a lower Manhattan office building 
47dc0217 Bids on that are due in mid April 
47dc0218 Doctor Zagury said his vaccine should be considered a prototype for testing but whether it confers protection against AIDS hasn\'t been proved 
47dc0219 The ultimate test of *efficacy* exposing the vaccinated subjects to the live AIDS virus hasn\'t been done for ethical reasons 
47dc021a However the next step is to test a vaccine in a large group of volunteers who are at high risk of being exposed to the virus 
47dc021b Doctor Zagury said he is trying to streamline his booster procedure to make it more widely applicable 
47dc021c Oddly and sadly neither candidate has talked much about this issue 
47dc021d [tongue_click] Maybe it doesn\'t lend itself to slogans 
47dc021e Maybe Messrs\. 
47dc021f Bush and Dukakis think that like taxes it crippled Walter Mondale four years ago 
47dc021g Maybe it\'s an issue the candidates haven\'t thought about 
47dc0301 We have a serious business situation because of the yen\'s appreciation and trade friction [loud_breath] an official of Brother Industries says 
47dc0302 [tongue_click] In mid nineteen seventy seven the company will begin making electronic typewriters in Bartlett Tennessee 
47dc0303 It set up a similar plant in Wales in nineteen eighty five 
47dc0304 [loud_breath] In addition to the war of nerves over discounts retail executives said this Christmas season has been characterized by the absence of a big hit in the toy department 
47dc0305 [tongue_click] But retailers have seen strong sales of big ticket items to well heeled customers 
47dc0306 [tongue_click] They are buying to beat the new tax law which will end the deduction of sales taxes and some interest expenses 
47dc0307 [loud_breath] Bally\'s drive into the hotel casino industry has made health clubs an increasingly awkward fit analysts said [loud_breath] and thus the most likely candidate for divestiture 
47dc0308 [loud_breath] By shedding the health club line Bally could focus on its remaining operations gambling machines state lotteries and amusement centers 
47dc0309 [loud_breath] Analysts also question the fit of the company\'s theme parks though saying a sale of that operation could follow 
47dc030a The new policy isn\'t clearly delineated 
47dc030b It stipulates that no new defense contract will be signed 
47dc030c But Mr\. Peres refused to respond to the reporters\' questions on how long existing arms export contracts with South Africa will run 
47dc030d Texaco filed for Chapter eleven protection citing the burden [loud_breath] of its ten \.POINT three billion legal battle with Pennzoil 
47dc030e The bankruptcy law case the largest in history [loud_breath] came after both firms apparently remained about two billion apart in settlement talks 
47dc030f Though the filing complicates the battle most experts believe neither company will emerge the winner 
47dc030g The court was split on both the Williams Act and commerce clause 
47dc030h Justice *Lewis* Powell acknowledged that the nineteen eighty two case of Edgar versus 
47dc030i [tongue_click] M\. I\. T\. E\. suggested that any state law that favored targets more than did the Williams Act would be invalid because Congress had preempted local regulations 
47dc030j The court backtracked here to say state laws might be O\. K\. if they help the William Act\'s purpose by heaping even more burdens on acquirers 
47dc030k [loud_breath] The system isn\'t a hundred \%PERCENT perfect but it\'s working reasonably well a Foreign Ministry official told reporters 
47dc030l The official said the U\. S\. has been similarly reassured 
47dc030m [tongue_click] Even so the U\. S\. has indicated that it wants Japan to take better care of how Japanese technology is sold around the world 
47dc030n [loud_breath] Another incentive that food processors cite for getting into the restaurant business is the high cost of introducing new grocery items 
47dc030o Starting a new brand can easily cost General Mills more than twenty million dollars in development and promotion costs 
47dc030p [lip_smack] Of course the Olive Garden start up brick and mortar and all has cost five times that 
47dc030q [loud_breath] Pratt and Whitney said last week it might lay off employees after the first of the year because of decreased demand for jet engines and parts 
47dc030r The company declined to discuss how many employees might be laid off or if the loss would be permanent or temporary 
47dc030s But union officials said the company has tossed around numbers from one thousand six hundred to two thousand 
47dc030t [lip_smack] As a result the government is talking of higher farm prices 
47dc030u But higher farm prices would add to an already steep inflation rate 
47dc030v [loud_breath] So Beijing officials reportedly talk of tying wages to inflation an idea reminiscent of the wage indexation tried in some Latin American nations several years ago with disastrous results 
47dc030w But U\. S\. manufacturers who took a beating during the first half of this decade continue to enjoy a roaring revival that began last year 
47dc030x As a result there is growing evidence that factory wage and price increases are accelerating 
47dc030y [loud_breath] And that could lead the Fed to boost interest rates in an effort to cool down the economy in the coming months 
47dc030z To be sure a few companies are trying to use the Olympics to make the transition from a subcontractor to an internationally known brand 
47dc0310 [loud_breath] Kukje Corporation shifted from producing Nike shoes to developing its own Pro Specs line of athletic shoes five years ago 
47dc0311 It paid four \.POINT five million dollars in cash and goods to be an official sponsor of the games and has been highlighting the logo in its advertising 
47dc0312 Kukje hopes the Olympics will help give Pro Specs a foothold in Europe 
47dc0313 The new emphasis on making schools work has pushed aside some other longstanding school debates 
47dc0314 Desegregation of public schools remains a goal but is entirely elusive in many areas 
47dc0315 Many families that could white or black fled to suburban private or parochial schools [loud_breath] has busing alone became a more discussed issue than school curricula 
47dc0316 With a few exceptions such as Yonkers and Kansas City federal judges have learned to eschew their tragic social engineering 
47dc0317 Most now leave school systems alone to attract students back not drive them out 
47dc0318 There is no evidence of recession like developments in these statistics said Norman Robertson chief economist at Mellon Bank Corporation 
47dc0319 As a result he said it\'s very difficult to believe that the Fed is going to ease at this time 
47dc031a Under these conditions the Fed will probably adopt a familiar wait and see attitude 
47dc031b Some of that cash has been used for bonus payments 
47dc031c Wages and bonuses rose nineteen \%PERCENT in the first half [loud_breath] a rate that far outpaced economic growth and exerted upward pressure on prices 
47dc031d China\'s economy grew at an annual rate of five \.POINT seven \%PERCENT in the first six months roughly half the average annual rate in the past decade 
47dc0401 The report doesn\'t include President Reagan\'s own version of events 
47dc0402 Does the president have a version of the events 
47dc0403 I don\'t know if he does said Mr\. Mathes 
47dc0404 [lip_smack] He said the White House was pleased that the report had been released because Mr\. Reagan wants to find out what happened 
47dc0405 Captain overhearing the radio discussion about runway oh five . I understood nothing 
47dc0406 [tongue_click] And what runway 
47dc0407 What are you talking about 
47dc0408 Last month\'s surge was widespread with auto sales rising one \.POINT nine \%PERCENT building materials one \.POINT two \%PERCENT and furniture climbing zero \.POINT seven \%PERCENT 
47dc0409 The only noticeable declines were in restaurants zero \.POINT six \%PERCENT and food stores zero \.POINT three \%PERCENT 
47dc040a Excluding autos sales rose zero \.POINT four \%PERCENT last month 
47dc040b If we look at the record the debate should be rather short 
47dc040c [lip_smack] The winners obvious 
47dc040d The only tragedy and it\'s an amazing one is that most Americans don\'t even know what has been accomplished and how it came about 
47dc040e Christians and Moslems marched across Beirut\'s sectarian demarcation line to protest Lebanon\'s economic crisis 
47dc040f [lip_smack] About ten thousand people participated in the rally 
47dc040g [tongue_click] Lebanon\'s currency has lost about eighty \%PERCENT against the value of the U\. S\. dollar this year and the inflation rate is estimated at about three hundred \%PERCENT 
47dc040h People are concerned about inflation Mr\. Worseck continued 
47dc040i They are concerned whether the dollar will go in the tank again 
47dc040j I don\'t think people are overreacting 
47dc040k Chrysler is resuming exports to Europe after its financial problems in the late nineteen seventies forced it to leave the market 
47dc040l The company plans to ship versions of its Dodge Shadow Dodge Daytona Shelby Z\. Plymouth Voyager and the LeBaron sedan coupe and convertible 
47dc040m The cars will be sold first in West Germany Belgium Austria the Netherlands and Switzerland 
47dc040n The road named West Street is a narrow strip of red gravel 
47dc040o It is like the proverbial railroad tracks in America that separate the rich side of town from the poor 
47dc040p The physical distance may not be great but the mental gap is 
47dc040q [loud_breath] The Honduran legislator again [loud_breath] I\'m almost convinced that the Sandinistas are going to be there forever 
47dc040r [loud_breath] I think we should go into a peace process with them 
47dc040s [loud_breath] I don\'t see ourselves going into a war and the Americans don\'t see themselves going into a Vietnam type war in Central America 
47dc040t Some wonder whether all the conversions don\'t make Mr\. Beregovoy more of an opportunist than a believer in the market economy 
47dc040u But his aides say he was convinced he was doing the right thing 
47dc040v Mr\. Beregovoy said I\'m not ashamed of what I do 
47dc040w The public filings show that a firm called Camro Associates acquired a one \%PERCENT nonvoting stake in Seemala in nineteen eighty four 
47dc040x Seemala disclosed the Camro stake in a public S\. E\. C\. filing that year Seemala didn\'t identify the investors in Camro 
47dc040y But a separate nineteen eighty four filing by Camro in California identifies Camro as a general partnership made up of Mr\. Milken and twenty six other Drexel employees 
47dc040z Roger Ailes the man who will guide George Bush\'s heavy a- media campaign is pumping up his anger like a lineman preparing to crush the opposing quarterback 
47dc0410 Michael Dukakis has the toughest knees and elbows today says the New York advertising executive who once pitched Richard Nixon as warm 
47dc0411 He\'s the meanest little son of a bitch I\'ve come across in politics 
47dc0412 Moans Stan Trilling a longtime O\. T\. C\. stockbroker at PaineWebber Incorporated in Los Angeles [loud_breath] It\'s like I know there\'s a parade out there 
47dc0413 I can hear the band marching by 
47dc0414 But they won\'t let me in the parade 
47dc0415 The overall market is being driven by these big cap takeover stocks but I\'m not participating 
47dc0416 Mr\. Turner may even know all this because his protectionist ardor is quite recent 
47dc0417 In the nineteen seventies he was a globally minded finance minister under Pierre Trudeau 
47dc0418 [lip_smack] Liberals led a royal commission that in nineteen eighty five endorsed free trade as the best way for Canada to reach its economic potential 
47dc0419 [tongue_click] Like Richard Gephardt and some other U\. S\. Democrats Mr\. Turner must believe protectionism is a hot button to political office 
47dc041a Insurance coverage for small medical bills is especially wasteful 
47dc041b [loud_breath] Usually it will cost an insurer more than fifty dollars to monitor effectively a fifty dollar physician bill thereby doubling the cost of health insurance 
47dc041c [lip_smack] [loud_breath] But failure to monitor encourages patients and doctors to make wasteful decisions with out fear of third party scrutiny 
47dc041d Europe by contrast offers a cornucopia of undervalued corporations and a wave of industrial restructuring stemming from its drive towards a single market by nineteen ninety two 
47dc041e [tongue_click] In Spain U\. S\. investment banks took a huge chunk of the recent batch of bank mergers 
47dc041f Shearson helped Italian financier Carlo De Benedetti make a pioneering albeit unsuccessful hostile bid for the giant Belgian holding company [loud_breath] Societe Generale de Belgique last year 
47ec0201 [tongue_click] The operating rate is still kind of low but it\'s coming back said Priscilla Luce senior economist at Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates in Philadelphia 
47ec0202 [loud_breath] There is some cause for optimism 
47ec0203 [loud_breath] She said export gains have spurred some of the improvement 
47ec0204 Texas started evaluating potential S\. S\. C\. sites about four years ago and now has solid data on six locations says Dillard Hammett state energy adviser 
47ec0205 [tongue_click] Four more communities have since asked to be included 
47ec0206 [tongue_click] Considering the state\'s flat relatively earthquake free landscape Mr\. Hammett says ninety five \%PERCENT of Texas could have the site 
47ec0207 There\'s probably also a psychological side to Augusta National\'s accent on experience 
47ec0208 The color that\'s second only to green hereabouts is gray 
47ec0209 It can be found mostly on the heads of participants and spectators 
47ec020a Gains from asset sales could offset the bank\'s increased loan loss provisions in later quarters 
47ec020b Mellon\'s interim chief executive Nathan Pearson told shareholders at the bank\'s annual meeting Monday [loud_breath] that he expects Mellon to return to profitability this year 
47ec020c But several profitable Mellon i- businesses including trust operations and data processing could be swamped by continued losses from energy and real estate loans 
47ec020d This year the same forces are at work 
47ec020e I believe the chances of a repeat of last year\'s performance are high says William Sterling a Merrill Lynch economist in Tokyo 
47ec020f [tongue_click] He expects to see only about seven billion <of> dollars of additional spending [loud_breath] not the thirty six billion dollars that Mr\. Nakasone is talking about 
47ec020g [loud_breath] In a letter to supporters Mr\. Nunn said his position as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee [loud_breath] foreclosed a run for the White House 
47ec020h [loud_breath] If I attempted to run for president and also carry out my Senate duties I would wind up doing neither well he wrote 
47ec020i Mr\. Nunn also expressed concern about the impact of a presidential campaign on my family 
47ec020j [tongue_click] The confrontation in federal court may break new ground in bankruptcy law 
47ec020k Other courts notably the one in charge of the Manville Corporation Chapter eleven proceedings [loud_breath] have set up trust funds to pay large classes of injury victims 
47ec020l [tongue_click] But Manville\'s two and a half billion dollar to three billion dollar trust includes provisions that allow it to expand if funds prove inadequate to pay asbestos related claims 
47ec020m [tongue_click] So far no judge has attempted to fix an absolute cap on a group of claims as huge and uncertain as those facing Robins 
47ec020n Another reason Mr\. Soifer is avoiding Morgan and Citicorp is that their stock prices at times have tended to gyrate more violently than other bank issues 
47ec020o Citicorp and Morgan tend to have more volatility on days when program trading is known to occur Mr\. Soifer says 
47ec020p [loud_breath] They\'re more of a bet on which way the market is headed 
47ec020q [tongue_click] In the two selected areas the state will allow procurement and retail prices to rise to what the open market demands 
47ec020r [loud_breath] The subsidy for consumers is meant to reduce the strain on urban residents 
47ec020s [tongue_click] Farmers of course will get higher prices for their grain from the market which in turn should induce them to re- increase production 
47ec020t Grain production throughout China has faltered in recent years [loud_breath] in part because state procurement prices were too low 
47ec020u Nicaragua\'s Sandinistas blamed a hardline Contra faction led by military commander [loud_breath] Enrique Bermudez for slowing progress in four days of peace talks that ended Monday in Managua 
47ec020v [tongue_click] Negotiations are scheduled to continue next week 
47ec020w [other_mouth_sound] [tongue_click] They said Bermudez favored continued military efforts to oust the ruling Sandinista regime 
47ec020x [tongue_click] Last year several major cities including Jacksonville Florida and Charlotte North Carolina prohibited or severely restricted construction of new outdoor advertisements 
47ec020y [tongue_click] Just last month Saint Louis adopted a billboard ban 
47ec020z [loud_breath] And officials in Richmond Virginia and Denver are considering cracking down 
47ec0210 [tongue_click] World Bank President Barber Conable said the bank will send a *delegation* to Argentina next week to review the measures 
47ec0211 [tongue_click] If the bank approves the details the bridge loan could go forward and the World Bank loans would be completed 
47ec0212 A bank spokesman said details of those loans won\'t be known until the delegation completes its work 
47ec0213 [tongue_click] Estimates of the makeup of the feedlot population vary widely 
47ec0214 Most analysts expect the government to report that the number of young cattle placed on feedlots fell in July for the !second consecutive month from a year earlier 
47ec0215 However some expect a rise 
47ec0216 He is striking now at a time when financing for big deals is readily available and the stock price is down 
47ec0217 [tongue_click] As recently as August R\. J\. R\.\'s stock was trading lower than its forty nine dollar level when Mr\. Johnson took over in January nineteen eighty seven 
47ec0218 The offer for a leveraged buy out probably will be at about seventy five dollars a share and now other tobacco stocks are soaring too 
47ec0219 In the past year and a half I\. B\. M\. has bought pieces of nearly a dozen companies stepping up the pace in recent months 
47ec021a The computer giant is mainly trying to buy technology or expertise in certain areas such as software for insurance companies in the case of its Policy Management stake 
47ec021b [tongue_click] I\. B\. M\. also seems to be trying to buy software developers\' loyalty in the increasingly competitive industry 
47ec021c Insurance coverage for small medical bills is especially wasteful 
47ec021d Usually it will cost an in- insurer more than fifty dollars to monitor effectively a fifty dollar physician bill thereby doubling the cost of health insurance 
47ec021e But failure to monitor encourages patients and doctors to make wasteful decisions without fear of third party scrutiny

47ec0302 [tongue_click] The people of El Barillo are under the boot 
47ec0303 [tongue_click] They\'ve been smart enough to survive 
47ec0304 They\'ve adapted 
47ec0305 To get its message to Madison Avenue decision makers Whittle Communications has been running a series of slick ads in newspapers and media trade journals 
47ec0306 We\'re wasting a lot of money on this ad announces a bold headline in one 
47ec0307 The point Virtually every advertiser in every medium is paying to reach viewers or readers who never become customers 
47ec0308 No other likely bidders stepped forward yesterday 
47ec0309 Hostile takeovers are almost unheard of in the defense industry 
47ec030a [loud_breath] But analysts have speculated that either Ford Motor Company or General Electric Company might be a good fit with Boeing if the companies were interested 
47ec030b Ford for instance has indicated that it is looking for acquisitions and has accumulated about nine billion dollars it could use for such purposes 
47ec030c A Ford spokesman citing company policy would neither confirm nor deny speculation about its interest 
47ec030d G\. E\. declined comment but a source close to the company said it isn\'t interested in Boeing 
47ec030e Property casualty insurer Fireman\'s Fund has since nineteen eighty three made three unforeseen additions to reserves for claims totaling more than one billion dollars 
47ec030f John Byrne Fireman\'s chairman says he\'s confident Fireman\'s is using excess resources to retire stock 
47ec030g [loud_breath] But he concedes buy backs can be risky for insurers 
47ec030h Also biotechnology companies are cash guzzlers constantly needing money for clinical trials and manufacturing facilities 
47ec030i The critical factor for most companies isn\'t how much cash they have but how it\'s being spent Mr\. MacCallum says 
47ec030j Some companies that are selling at close to their per share cash values are correctly being perceived in a skeptical light he contends 
47ec030k [loud_breath] Mr\. Schmied is being tested early in a position he didn\'t seem eager to occupy 
47ec030l Analysts say he is an operations man who never exhibited any ambition to become chief executive 
47ec030m I never got the overwhelming sense that he was eager to succeed Mr\. Flavin says Christopher Demisch an analyst at First Boston Corp\. 
47ec030n Moreover Mr\. Sawyer isn\'t thought to possess a lot of clout 
47ec030o He doesn\'t fit the boss image that the late Mayor Daley made famous and that m- Mayor Washington was beginning to acquire 
47ec030p [loud_breath] He\'s a weak guy says Mr\. Rose the political consultant subject to a lot of pressure and obviously not a crusader 
47ec030q [tongue_click] Asked how he viewed the Prudential Bache unit Mr\. Winters said Are we pleased with their results 
47ec030r Of course not 
47ec030s [tongue_click] Are we pleased with their direction 
47ec030t Yes 
47ec030u [tongue_click] Mr\. Winters added that Prudential Bache may be more deliberate this year in some of its expansion 
47ec030v [tongue_click] He also voiced confidence in Chairman George Ball despite the losses calling him [loud_breath] the most qualified guy in the U\. S\. 
47ec030w For authors and publishers a new competitor in the book club field is a godsend 
47ec030x Book club rights are second only to paperback rights in providing additional revenue for publishers 
47ec030y [tongue_click] Furthermore a book club imprimatur on a book gives it enormous cachet with bookstore managers 
47ec030z [tongue_click] Not long after the Northwest announcement the institute wired a press release to media organizations detailing the large number of passenger complaints about Northwest\'s service 
47ec0310 [loud_breath] Airline passengers who fly Northwest appear to have a lot to complain about [loud_breath] and they did so in droves last year the release began 
47ec0311 [tongue_click] It went on to say that complaints against Northwest increased one thousand four hundred and eighteen \%PERCENT in the past year 
47ec0312 Many blame that change on simple geography and an effort to move away from unions 
47ec0313 But some critics also accuse the Japanese companies of deliberately avoiding blacks

47ec0315 The two laboratories that Nichols purchased are in Lincoln Nebraska and Sioux City Iowa

47ec0317 Additional payments to be made over an eight year period have a current value of six \.POINT one million dollars Nichols said 
47ec0318 The additional payments are contingent upon certain material aspects of the business of the two labs remaining intact for three years Nichols said 
47ec0319 [loud_breath] Since Monday\'s opening bell N\. C\. N\. B\. n- shares have jumped four and three eighths per- points closing at twenty seven and seven eighths yesterday 
47ec031a [tongue_click] Many analysts predict the stock could go higher soon perhaps crossing the thirty dollar a share barrier for the first time in a year 
47ec031b [tongue_click] Long term bulls predict N\. C\. N\. B\.\'s price could easily double and some say triple 
47ec031c The agency has been under growing pressure from Representative John Dingell democrat Michigan [loud_breath] and other lawmakers to tighten regulation of the generics industry 
47ec031d [loud_breath] Senator Orrin Hatch republican Utah ranking minority member on the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee welcomed the plan 
47ec031e [loud_breath] It is my strong belief that sufficient evidence has been uncovered to warrant these changes he said in a statement 
47ec0401 [loud_breath] It\'s a sad day for Wall Street said a First Boston Corporation spokesman 
47ec0402 Stock traders cautioned that the government hasn\'t yet won convictions on its latest cases 
47ec0403 But both lawmakers and stock market professionals said yesterday\'s arrests send a clear signal An overhaul of takeover and securities practices has become increasingly likely 
47ec0404 [tongue_click] Senator William Proxmire democrat Wisconsin sharply criticized the Fed for dropping the M\. one target

47ec0408 When Hu . Yaobang was dumped in January as the Communist Party\'s secretary general Mr\. Zhao was elevated to that post on an acting basis 
47ec0409 That made Mr\. Zhao a protege of Deng Xiaoping the de facto head of the party as well as the government 
47ec040a [tongue_click] It is a delicate position requiring him to maneuver among various interest groups [loud_breath] and personal cliques that make up China\'s top leadership 
47ec040b [tongue_click] Some have characterized our countermeasures as protectionist brought about because of congressional pressures 
47ec040c That is dead wrong 
47ec040d [tongue_click] We have been in consultations with Japan on this issue since November long before present trade n- legislation was introduced 
47ec040e [tongue_click] The president\'s action was the culmination of that process and it had nothing whatsoever to do with trade bills 
47ec040f [loud_breath] President Reagan believes that people and nations should honor their obligations 
47ec040g There is nothing protectionist about that

47ec040p [tongue_click] James Mahoney Mr\. Carson\'s spokesman says the split with Mr\. Bushkin occurred after Mr\. Carson decided to sell his television production business 
47ec040q There aren\'t any financial irregularities he says 
47ec040r [tongue_click] They differed on the manner in which his companies were being sold 
47ec040s [tongue_click] Mr\. Carson is said to have decided to sell Carson Productions piecemeal instead of as a going concern 
47ec040t Mr\. Bushkin reportedly favored keeping the company whole rather than auctioning individual assets 
47ec040u Fresh faces appear at the Rainbow Kitchen almost daily among them a young couple back from a disillusioning job hunting sojourn to the Sun Belt

47ec0415 [tongue_click] Mr\. Papageorge said These were conceptual negotiations 
47ec0416 Ideas were flowing 
47ec0417 We were seeing what worked for each of us 
47ec0418 [tongue_click] The two of us were trying to think of a way to satisfy everyone 
47ec0419 But it\'s what this election is all about 
47ec041a The real question on the ballot is Should the Reagan Years continue beyond the Reagan years 
47ec041b Beyond the Bush years 
47ec041c [tongue_click] Beyond even the Quayle years 
47ec041d The Supreme Court will determine that and the next president will determine the court\'s makeup for at least another generation 
47ec041e Warner Lambert and Schering Plough are co- coveted for their over the counter drugs as well as for prescription sales

47ec041g They aren\'t research intensive they\'re marketing intensive one analyst said 
47fc0201 The sale of the hotels is part of Holiday\'s strategy to sell off assets and concentrate on property management [door_slam] 
47fc0202 The hotel operator\'s Embassy Suites Hotels Incorporated subsidiary will continue to manage the properties 
47fc0203 [tongue_click] Long term management contracts allow us to generate income on a significantly lower capital base said Michael D\. Rose Holiday\'s chairman and chief executive officer 
47fc0204 [tongue_click] [loud_breath] Albert Halprin chief of the F\. C\. C\.\'s common carrier bureau said he hadn\'t seen the consumer group\'s study 
47fc0205 He said previous studies by the group had focused on flat rate service for local calls 
47fc0206 [tongue_click] Mr\. Halprin conceded that such rates had risen sharply but he added that phone companies now offer a variety of local telephone plans at differing prices 
47fc0207 Around that time Mr\. Genger also met with Mr\. el Sayed 
47fc0208 [tongue_click] He surfaced to meet with Genger after Genger had made the approach to the company said Mr\. Trotman the Drexel Burnham banker 
47fc0209 [tongue_click] I think he was trying to find a way back in [loud_breath] 
47fc020a But Mr\. Trotman said Mr\. el Sayed isn\'t involved in the Trans Resources bid [loud_breath] 
47fc020b [tongue_click] [loud_breath] Instead Mr\. Reagan agreed to lower the volume of his comments supporting the Contras and criticizing the Democratic controlled Congress 
47fc020c He also would hold off any new proposals for Contra military aid until September thirtieth 
47fc020d [tongue_click] If the Sandinista government had made significant democratic reforms and a ceasefire was in place Mr\. Reagan would end his Contra military aid program 
47fc020e In Korea labor conflicts have added heat to the unstable political situation 
47fc020f [tongue_click] The new unions are growing more adversarial [loud_breath] 
47fc020g Companies keep asking the government to smash the unions 
47fc020h But the ruling party can\'t risk alienating workers who will vote in the coming elections 
47fc020i It refuses so far to backtrack on its July one promise of greater democracy or to return to the policy of overt union busting 
47fc020j [loud_breath] [tongue_click] In a nineteen seventy eight seventy nine administrative proceeding the S\. E\. C\.\'s enforcement division pressed for Mr\. Kobrin\'s permanent expulsion from the securities business 
47fc020k [tongue_click] The division argued that stock manipulation of the kind he had been engaged in went to the heart of the securities laws 
47fc020l The division also said the law directed the S\. E\. C\. to act on the belief that past misconduct raised a risk of future misconduct that might justify expulsion 
47fc020m Certainly foreign competition and a changing world economy have exacted a heavy toll on our nation\'s manufacturing industries 
47fc020n However many of these industries have survived and are now as tough and lean as they\'ve ever been 
47fc020o The managers of these companies have learned through hard experience about exactly what investments pay off 
47fc020p [loud_breath] Although airlines deny handling complaints differently they make no apologies about favoring frequent fliers in other ways 
47fc020q They say they are only trying to boost membership in these programs which airlines consider crucial for developing brand loyalty 
47fc020r [tongue_click] These are our most important customers says a United spokesman 
47fc020s [tongue_click] Mr\. Antoniu\'s f:ull and surprising rebound prove there is life after insider trading 
47fc020t [loud_breath] But his story also suggests that some character traits that may give rise to insider trading can be hard to change 
47fc020u [tongue_click] Insider trading is a form of fraud and some Sport About franchisees now claim they have been defrauded by Mr\. Antoniu 
47fc020v [tongue_click] Still traders were encouraged by investor reaction to this week\'s Treasury financing especially yesterday\'s thirty year bond sale 
47fc020w [tongue_click] We thought there was very broad Japanese participation in the bond auction said Mr\. Lakefield of Shearson Lehman 
47fc020x [tongue_click] But the real question is whether the Japanese bought for short term trading accounts or for long term investment 
47fc020y [tongue_click] Individual investors looking for some excitement in their lives aren\'t likely to be enthralled by Mr\. Berg\'s advice [loud_breath] 
47fc020z [tongue_click] He suggests that they drop their hard earned dollars into the most conservative of investments T\. bills and sit tight 
47fc0210 [tongue_click] There\'s no sense trying to play games with this market Mr\. Berg explains 
47fc0211 Things are a bit duller this year 
47fc0212 [tongue_click] Mr\. Bilzerian has sent his boy to a Little League team in faraway Minnesota where the family spends its summers and isn\'t coaching a team this year 
47fc0213 [tongue_click] All the action apparently will be in the courtroom [loud_breath] 
47fc0214 [loud_breath] The Grand Metropolitan operations which were acquired by that company in nineteen eighty have enjoyed a good reputation in the industry 
47fc0215 But PepsiCo feels its territories can be better exploited due to their proximity to exisiting company owned bottlers 
47fc0216 It owns its Los Angeles and San Francisco bottlers for instance making the central California territory a good fit 
47fc0217 It also already owns its bottlers in central and northern Florida and parts of Georgia 
47fc0218 There are some great opportunities to maximize production and marketing efficiencies the PepsiCo spokesman said 
47fc0219 Peter DaPuzzo head of retail trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton also looks for a sharp upward move in stock prices given a few ifs 
47fc021a [tongue_click] One is if investors don\'t get spooked at the anniversary of the crash 
47fc021b Another is if the Federal Reserve eases interest rates 
47fc021c And a third is if George Bush wins the presidential election 
47fc021d But Service Merchandise jumped one and three eighths to eighteen and one quarter on one \.POINT four million shares 
47fc021e The stock slid to twelve and one quarter in September after the company announced that an investor group had decided not to proceed with a possible acquisition offer 
47fc021f Since then the stock has been rising on takeover rumors 
47fc0301 [tongue_click] When Hu Yaobang was dumped in January as the Communist Party\'s secretary general Mr\. Zhao was elevated to that post on an acting basis 
47fc0302 That made Mr\. Zhao a protege of Deng Xiaoping the de facto head of the party as well as the government 
47fc0303 It is a delicate position requiring him to maneuver among various interest groups and personal cliques that make up China\'s top leadership 
47fc0304 PaineWebber itself hasn\'t been charged with wrongdoing [loud_breath] 
47fc0305 [loud_breath] [tongue_click] The firm a unit of PaineWebber Group Incorporated released a short statement yesterday in which it said the two men have been suspended indefinitely 
47fc0306 The firm has cooperated with the U\. S\. Attorney\'s office throughout the investigation and will continue to do so 
47fc0307 Then there are utility stocks 
47fc0308 [tongue_click] The Nasdaq Utility Index jumped eighteen \%PERCENT in the first quarter while indexes of listed utility stocks rose barely three \%PERCENT 
47fc0309 [tongue_click] But in fact most of the fifty five electric gas and water utility stocks on Nasdaq performed much like their counterparts on the major exchanges 
47fc030a Producers however say the guild demand really represents an effort to squeeze in more than one session a day 
47fc030b [tongue_click] The actors are paid by the session not by the hour and both sides agree that sessions rarely exceed three hours 
47fc030c [tongue_click] And with the guild choosing such a critical time for the strike T\. V\. production officials are especially irate 
47fc030d [tongue_click] When my family fled we left my nanny in charge of the house 
47fc030e [loud_breath] But soon a lieutenant in the revolutionary army evicted her and installed his mistress [loud_breath] 
47fc030f [tongue_click] Later the house went to the North Koreans 
47fc030g F\. D\. A\. researchers say they don\'t know much yet about the long term effects of fat substitutes mixing with medication and other substances 
47fc030h Typically lab tests on food products are for the life cycle of rats or mice about four years 
47fc030i Researchers say they aren\'t sure such tests parallel human consumption of fat over long periods 
47fc030j [tongue_click] We just don\'t know says the F\. D\. A\.\'s Mr\. Mertz 
47fc030k With every new development there are risks 
47fc030l Announcement of the talks surprised analysts and failed to impress investors 
47fc030m [tongue_click] British Aerospace shares fell twenty five pence forty four cents to three hundred and twenty nine pence in late trading yesterday on London\'s stock exchange 
47fc030n The handful of Rover shares trading jumped nineteen pence to eighty six pence after the announcement but fell back to eighty two pence 
47fc030o [loud_breath] Mr\. Thayer said Mr\. Young received a lump sum payment to settle his contract with Gilbraltar Financial but wouldn\'t disclose the amount 
47fc030p Mr\. Young\'s contract which ran until January twenty four nineteen ninety one called for a salary of at least four hundred and ten thousand dollars a year 
47fc030q In nineteen eighty six Mr\. Young was paid five hundred and fifty thousand five hundred and ninety six dollars [misc_noise] 
47fc030r [tongue_click] As a recent visit revealed the soup kitchen has become a more powerful magnet drawing hundreds who come for more than just daily nourishment 
47fc030s Mr\. Kovacs an octogenarian who croons love ballads to anyone who will listen comes for camaraderie 
47fc030t [tongue_click] For George a middle aged retarded man the kitchen is a lifeline 
47fc030u [tongue_click] He arrived five years ago picked up a broom and without saying a word started cleaning up he now gets paid the minimum wage 
47fc030v The offer is a brilliant defense contrived by Santa Fe\'s investment bankers at Salomon Brothers and Goldman Sachs 
47fc030w [loud_breath] The sixty three dollars a share price will hang over the negotiations like smog over Los Angeles 
47fc030x And though Mr\. Dingman will offer package after package that seems to add up to sixty three dollars he doesn\'t really plan to meet the asking price 
47fc030y Instead he hopes to persuade Santa Fe to take less 
47fc030z [tongue_click] For one hundred years Wyoming has been riding a roller coaster 
47fc0310 [loud_breath] When commodity prices rise people rush to Wyoming for short term work at boom town pay 
47fc0311 Government revenues largely underwritten by energy company taxes explode 
47fc0312 When commodity prices sour people pull out often with their mobile homes trailing behind 
47fc0313 [tongue_click] And revenues slump 
47fc0314 [tongue_click] The reason for the relatively modest incentive programs is that the auto makers are demonstrating a much better ability to keep production in line with sales 
47fc0315 [tongue_click] Inventories of U\. S\. made cars stood at fifty nine days supply at the end of August according to Ward\'s Automotive Reports an industry trade publication 
47fc0316 That is considered a normal supply and it is the lowest stock in twenty two months 
47fc0317 [loud_breath] [tongue_click] Talk over trade aroused interest in two financial concerns 
47fc0318 [tongue_click] Mercantile Bancorp soared five and a half to thirty and three quarters on renewed buy out speculation 
47fc0319 [tongue_click] Sun State Savings and Loan ended at eight and a quarter up two after confirming that it received an unsolicited acquisition proposal from an investment group [loud_breath] 
47fc031a In Houston a Coastal spokesman said the fight isn\'t over 
47fc031b We anticipate asking for a rehearing or appealing to the Supreme Court the spokesman said 
47fc031c He added We were quite surprised by the reversal 
47fc031d We thought we had a solid case 
47fc0401 I\'ve been trying to live my life by an idea she says pointing to a video game 
47fc0402 See that machine [loud_breath] 
47fc0403 That\'s an idea 
47fc0404 Rock and roll [loud_breath] 
47fc0405 That\'s an idea [loud_breath] 
47fc0406 In heavy trading Friday profit taking caused the Nikkei average to slip seventy \.POINT one eight to twenty one thousand one hundred and five \.POINT eighty five 
47fc0407 [tongue_click] The decline snapped a string of five record closings 
47fc0408 [tongue_click] The stock exchange index fell twelve \.POINT ninety two points to one thousand eight hundred and sixteen \.POINT sixty nine 
47fc0409 [tongue_click] Volume totaled about one billion shares [loud_breath] 
47fc040a [tongue_click] Mr\. Abboud also gained a reputation during the First Chicago years as being abrasive and sometimes harsh with subordinates and that tag has lingered 
47fc040b I\'ve never seen an adjective used so much in connection with a person\'s name he said in a nineteen eighty four interview 
47fc040c [loud_breath] People think the A in A\. Robert Abboud stands for abrasive [loud_breath] 
47fc040d [loud_breath] In Amsterdam stocks closed lower in volatile trading 
47fc040e [tongue_click] Selected issues ended off their intraday lows though after Wall Street\'s lower opening proved less severe than some Dutch forecasters anticipated dealers said 
47fc040f Volatile trading throughout the session produced wide price fluctuations as Dutch institutions bargain hunted while overseas investors tended to sell shares 
47fc040g [loud_breath] Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value 
47fc040h [tongue_click] Thus higher bidding narrows the investor\'s return while lower bidding widens it 
47fc040i [tongue_click] The percentage rates are calculated on a three hundred and sixty day year while the coupon equivalent yield is based on a three hundred and sixty five day year 
47fc040j Technically the stopgap bill will leave the government out of money over the weekend 
47fc040k But that should have little practical effect since most operations will be closed during that time 
47fc040l Congressional leaders hope however it will pressure lawmakers to finish their work before Monday 
47fc040m [tongue_click] Some months before the crash interest rates started to move up 
47fc040n Home mortgage rates went up almost ten times as fast as they came down 
47fc040o [loud_breath] The money supply growth was muddling at or below the lower end of the target range a phenomenon we have not experienced for many years 
47fc040p [loud_breath] For a ship or missile guided by the wrong time signal that little gap could mean arriving at the wrong destination 
47fc040q [loud_breath] If we let the difference grow says Mr\. McCarthy we could run into problems over thousands of years 
47fc040r [loud_breath] It might be noon by atomic time but dark outside [loud_breath] 
47fc040s This heady mixture of piety and gutter fighting we fear is likely to detract from causes we would like to advance 
47fc040t [tongue_click] This is perfectly illustrated by Mr\. Robertson\'s charge that there are Russian intermediate range missiles in Cuba 
47fc040u It is perfectly true that the I\. N\. F\. treaty gives us no rights to inspect for missiles in the Soviet\'s island satellite 
47fc040v [tongue_click] And it is true that Soviet bases there are a danger to the U\. S\. 
47fc040w But to pose these valid issues in the most inflammatory way Mr\. Robertson has charged that the missiles are already deployed and in place 
47fc040x [tongue_click] If this is presented as the issue the answer is no and the valid points are lost 
47fc040y [tongue_click] Kaiser\'s present value is equally uncertain the company estimates that its net worth is at least a negative five hundred million 
47fc040z In its lawsuits against former management the company is seeking damages of more than three hundred million for alleged self dealing and mismanagement 
47fc0410 [tongue_click] In the process the suits allege assets were overstated and liabilities understated 
47fc0411 The shortage of Western capacity makes Soviet launchers attractive [loud_breath] 
47fc0412 [tongue_click] A series of launch disasters including the Challenger explosion severely curtailed Western access to space in nineteen eighty six eighty seven 
47fc0413 The European Ariane launcher just returned to commercial service 
47fc0414 The U\. S\. space program will not eliminate its backlog of payloads until the early nineteen nineties 
47fc0415 You think that\'s weird 
47fc0416 [tongue_click] Think again 
47fc0417 He\'s not alone 
47fc0418 [loud_breath] Carbide\'s sabotage theory is weakened partly because it hasn\'t disclosed all its evidence 
47fc0419 Though its attorneys say they have interviewed the alleged saboteur extensively they won\'t disclose his name or whereabouts or describe him 
47fc041a They also decline to say whether they understand his motives or have any witnesses 
47fc041b [tongue_click] The one element of suspense remains the selection of a running mate for Vice President Bush\'s presidential campaign 
47fc041c Bush managers insist they won\'t disclose the vice presidential nominee\'s identity until Thursday morning 
47fc041d Reagan arrived at the convention site last night and prepared for his farewell speech to the party tonight 
47fc041e The president leaves for California tomorrow and Bush will arrive to take control of the convention 
47fc041f [misc_noise] It is a crucial time in which Bush must attempt to move out from under Reagan\'s shadow and establish his own identity

47gc030i It doesn\'t make me a shareholder comfortable with what is happening in the company 
47gc030j [tongue_click] He also was emphatic about keeping Burger King 
47gc030k [tongue_click] I want to say without qualification that Burger King is central to Pillsbury 
47gc030l It was true yesterday it is true today and it remains true for the company\'s strategic future he said 
47gc030m Some issuers are also wary of doing away with outside counsel 
47gc030n In Washington state a proposal to use the attorney general as counsel on all state bond issues came before a legislative committee last year 
47gc030o [tongue_click] [loud_breath] Its adoption would have saved Washington more than two hundred thousand dollars a year 
47gc030p Strong opposition from the attorney general\'s office defeated the proposal however 
47gc030q [tongue_click] [loud_breath] Mr\. Moreland couldn\'t be reached for comment but attorneys representing him have previously denied he committed any acts of fraud 
47gc030r An attorney for Mr\. Reynolds in San Diego said \"QUOTE we feel our client did nothing in violation of the securities laws \"END\-QUOTE

47gc030u The latest weather forecast calls for fairly good moisture in Midwest farming states over the next six to ten days 
47gc030v Analysts said traders are shifting their emphasis away from last year\'s crop and to this year\'s 
47gc030w With this year\'s small acreage increases weather and spring planting conditions are major concerns to a market that is beginning to shake off a huge surplus 
47gc030x [tongue_click] The favorable conditions helped the soybean contract for November settlement close at six \.POINT eight two two five dollars a bushel [loud_breath] down nine \.POINT five cents 
47gc030y Further signs of strong U\. S\. economic growth are expected to emerge from a Labor Department report next Friday [loud_breath] on the nation\'s employment picture for August 
47gc030z If so Federal Reserve officials may raise short term interest rates further within a few weeks several analysts said 
47gc0310 They also predicted that banks will raise their prime or base rates again to ten and one half \%PERCENT or eleven \%PERCENT from the current ten \%PERCENT level 
47gc0311 [tongue_click] [loud_breath] The study was part of Cornell\'s response to calls by local politicians that it should help more in Tompkins County 
47gc0312 [tongue_click] When the schools were ranked by operating budget or value of buildings Cornell\'s one \.POINT two million payments were found to be near the bottom of the list 
47gc0313 [tongue_click] In per student payments Cornell ranked seventh at seventy dollars 
47gc0314 [tongue_click] To be sure on a lot of scores the summit was a success 
47gc0315 Economic cooperation was advanced with businessmen signing agreements for about thirty contracts and several joint ventures 
47gc0316 [tongue_click] [loud_breath] Human rights too may have taken a step forward if Mr\. Gorbachev lives up to his promise to release all political prisoners by year\'s end 
47gc0317 [tongue_click] [loud_breath] B\. P\. could spend up to ten million dollars on a U\. S\. takeover Mr\. Lazier says [loud_breath] by financing it with a blend of debt and equity 
47gc0318 [tongue_click] [loud_breath] Los Angeles based Unocal Corporation with extensive refining and marketing activities on the West Coast [loud_breath] long has been seen as a possible acquisition target 
47gc0319 Buying Unocal could also give B\. P\. a needed boost in its natural gas reserves 
47gc031a [tongue_click] Other takeover possibilities include Phillips Petroleum Company of Barlettesville Oklahoma and New York based [loud_breath] Amerada Hess Corporation 
47gc031b As a result it can make sales in keeping with market conditions without having a significant effect on its economy Mr\. Nichols said 
47gc031c Last year it estimated the Soviet Union made between two hundred and twenty million dollars and two hundred and thirty million dollars from sales of palladium 
47gc031d It made billions on gold 
47gc0401 [other_mouth_sound] [loud_breath] The department also said that productivity for nonfinancial companies increased at a [loud_breath] oh \.POINT three \%PERCENT annual rate in the third quarter a preliminary estimate 
47gc0402 [tongue_click] [loud_breath] The estimate is based on an increase in output of one \.POINT four \%PERCENT and an increase in hours worked of one \.POINT one \%PERCENT 
47gc0403 [other_mouth_sound] This is the first quarter in which productivity increased in a nonfinancial sector since the third quarter of nineteen eighty five 
47gc0404 [tongue_click] [loud_breath] In recent years however insider trading cases have sometimes involved people who are quite remote from companies that are the subject of inside information 
47gc0405 [tongue_click] [loud_breath] Since nineteen eighty the Supreme Court has suggested without being specific that such cases might involve misappropriation or illegal use of information 
47gc0406 [tongue_click] [loud_breath] A decision in the Winans case may help define securities fraud by misappropriation 
47gc0407 These teens crave excitement 
47gc0408 They spurn rest and recreation

47gc040a Especially money 
47gc040b Last month Piedmont\'s board recommended that the company accept Norfolk Southern\'s bid to acquire the company for sixty five dollars a share 
47gc040c Norfolk Southern has had a stake in Piedmont since nineteen eighty one 
47gc040d [tongue_click] [loud_breath] But one day after the board\'s recommendation U\. S\. Air sweetened its initial bid for Piedmont forcing the board to drop its recommendation 
47gc040e [loud_breath] [tongue_click] Inco\'s stock has caught technical analysts\' attention too

47gc040k [tongue_click] [loud_breath] Then we found ourselves described as the center of conservative intellectual hypocrisy on judicial restraint 
47gc040l [tongue_click] We believe we\'re coming to understand the meaning of neoliberal an ex liberal who attacks conservatives in the process of adopting their positions 
47gc040m [tongue_click] [loud_breath] The finding uniformly surprised longtime researchers in the fields 
47gc040n There is a scientific rationale behind T\. H\. A\. says Doctor Leon Thal a researcher at San Diego Veterans *Administration* Hospital 
47gc040o But the results were overwhelming and when you get results like that out of the blue the first reaction is to be skeptical 
47gc040p That test was less than a complete success 
47gc040q [tongue_click] [loud_breath] Dirt that accumulated in the kenaf during harvesting [tongue_click] [loud_breath] wasn\'t all removed and ended up in the paper 
47gc040r [tongue_click] [other_mouth_sound] The kenaf also jammed in some equipment because it had been cut in lengths that were several feet long 
47gc040s [tongue_click] [loud_breath] Representative Foley said that there was general agreement that a deficit reduction package should consist half of spending cuts and half of revenue raising measures 
47gc040t But negotiators still couldn\'t agree on what cun- constitutes revenue raisers or spending cuts 
47gc040u [tongue_click] [loud_breath] House Republican Leader Robert Michel of Illinois complained [loud_breath] I\'m just asking the Democrats to give us real savings 
47gc040v [tongue_click] [loud_breath] Most Arab states broke off relations with Egypt when that country signed a peace treaty with Israel eight years ago

47gc0415 Even after finding a buyer completing a foreclosure sale is hardly routine 
47gc0416 [tongue_click] Brokers at Merrill Lynch Realty recall a sale that was delayed for a month by a one million dollar Internal Revenue Service lien [loud_breath] on the property 
47gc0417 [tongue_click] Another sale was delayed when the lender discovered that the owner had died between the time the property was posted for foreclosure [loud_breath] and the foreclosure was completed 
47gc0418 [tongue_click] [loud_breath] We were at the closing table when this all came out says Wanda Hutchins the Merrill Lynch agent 
47gc0419 Invalid forec- foreclosures are one of the biggest problems we have 
47gc041a [tongue_click] [other_mouth_sound] [loud_breath] The lower volatility could be especially important right now when the course of interest rates seem especially cloudy 
47gc041b [tongue_click] [other_mouth_sound] While interest rates have been declining recently many economists expect rates to rise by year end 
47gc041c After that however they say rates could fall again perhaps sharply as economic growth slows in nineteen eighty nine 
47gc041d [tongue_click] [other_mouth_sound] The most widely used estrogen product in the U\. S\. is sold under the brand name Premarin [loud_breath] by American Home Products Corporation\'s [loud_breath] Wyeth a- Ayerst Laboratories

47gc041f A spokeswoman for the company said Premarin isn\'t currently indicated for use in preventing heart disease [loud_breath] but the company is researching the matter 
47hc0201 The accord most likely would include some private agreement among ministers on how far up or down these rates can move and still be acceptable 
47hc0202 But officials said it is -a unlikely these limits would be made public 
47hc0203 And it isn\'t known yet whether the major powers would pledge to intervene in currency markets if exchange rates were to exceed those limits 
47hc0204 How is Wall Street reacting to the changes 
47hc0205 Some investment bankers feel threatened by it others scoff at suggestion that these efforts are truly competitive 
47hc0206 But some say the case isn\'t clear 
47hc0207 Few developers are big enough to justify the cost of these divisions 
47hc0208 The test will be whether the new units are adding value to their organizations 
47hc0209 If not one investment banker says the partners will kill them 
47hc020a In Cleveland Higbee chief executive officer Robert Broadbent says the retailer has benefited from its parent\'s financial expertise

47hc0210 Mr\. Kgori decides to go straight on the dirt road even though it will take him an hour out of his way 
47hc0211 That was illustrated by a temporary surge in securities lending during last October\'s crash and a previous securities settlements backlog in Britain 
47hc0212 Said one United Kingdom monetary official Clearly there was demand in the market for more equities m:oney broking 
47hc0213 What you are seeing with Shearson\'s move is a reflection of that demand 
47hc0214 Some banking analysts doubt a London or Tokyo bank would make a similar acquisition anytime here soon 
47hc0215 Among other things some foreign banks have been shying away from acquiring assets in the United States because of unexpectedly high expenses managing them from afar [misc_noise]

47hc021e To the extent that export growth continues it will keep the United States economy from slipping added Mr\. Witten 
47hc021f [tongue_click] So you can have a soft landing scenario based on expanding exports 
47hc021g A soft landing combines moderate economic growth with low inflation 
47hc0301 Prices moved up in response to news that United States durable goods orders declined seven \.POINT five \%PERCENT in January 
47hc0302 [tongue_click] Prices also slid after the release of the Tower Commission report on the Reagan administration\'s involvement in the Iran Contra affair

47hc0306 [tongue_click] He declined to identify the division that will be sold 
47hc0307 The look and feel cases are generating controversy in the industry 
47hc0308 [tongue_click] Companies bringing the suits say they are defending the rewards due those who develop innovative software from companies that are selling cut rate copies 
47hc0309 [misc_noise] But others argue that new software always borrows from the old

47hc030k Political observers theorize that the political rehabilitation is linked to this invisible presidential race 
47hc030l Some say for instance that Mr\. de la Madrid put the former minister on display to goad other candidates into working harder 
47hc030m [tongue_click] Others suggest that one presidential hopeful is using the popular Mr\. Silva Herzog [tongue_click] to undermine his rivals 
47hc030n The most provocative hypothesis has it that Mr\. Silva Herzog has himself become a candidate again 
47hc030o We are aware of our international obligations and we willingly accept them the banker observes 
47hc030p But the Bundesbank he asserts has to be very cautious in setting its monetary policy

47hc030u The one element of suspense remains the selection of a running mate for Vice President Bush\'s presidential campaign 
47hc030v Bush managers insist they won\'t disclose the vice presidential\'s nominee\'s identity until Thursday morning

47hc030x The president leaves for California tomorrow and Bush will arrive to take control of the convention

47hc0409 United States bank regulations are another stumbling block 
47hc040a Currently banks can\'t own more than [um] nineteen \.POINT nine \%PERCENT of a non financial company and can only be passive investors 
47hc040b [tongue_click] Unless these restrictions are dropped banks are likely to be swapping mainly for equity in fina:ncial institutions 
47hc040c Those aren\'t always appealing or even available 
47hc040d [door_slam] Mexico nationalized its banks five years ago 
47hc040e And in Brazil central bank figures show that one out of every seven bank loans is past due eight times the delinquency rate of a year l- earlier [cross_talk]

47hc040q [misc_noise] I know it will be horrific he says staring down at his lunch but it is important to take this stand 
47hc040r I think individuals can make a difference 
47hc040s The budget however will not manage itself 
47hc040t Some way must be found to put it on course 
47hc040u In our history an impasse over policy has been broken occasionally by some sort of national commission and it is time for one again 
47hc040v Such a commission resolved the Social Security problem earlier in this decade 
47hc040w In the Johnson years a commission\'s proposals were the means for restructuring the budget 
47hc040x Still earlier it was a commission that recommended the creation of the Federal Reserve System 
47hc040y This approach enables the president and members of Congress to avoid some flak by merely *implementing* what the commission told us to do 
47hc040z Thus the board said it would be reluctant to give Bank of New York more than one extension of the initial ninety days to consummate the merger 
47hc0410 Normally extensions of the ninety day rule are granted freely 
47hc0411 But in the pending merger the board wants to avoid a long and fruitless struggle said Mr\. Bradfield the Fed\'s general counsel 
47hc0412 One of the more direct readings on information will come in Friday\'s report on consumer prices which are expected not surprisingly to be higher 
47hc0413 Analysts expect an increase of about \.POINT four \%PERCENT in the April consumer price index on the heels of a \.POINT five \%PERCENT jump the previous month 
47hc0414 [tongue_click] The price increases are expected pretty much across the board as commodities and services are rising at about a four \%PERCENT annual rate 
47hc0415 But there is always the risk that reviving a classic slogan or spokesman will backfire and create an old fashioned image for a brand 
47hc0416 To guard against that marketers tend to give their recycled ads a contemporary twist 
47hc0417 Captain Raid of nineteen eighty eight for example has rippling m:uscles and a futuristic look 
47hc0418 ~~ 
47hc0419 Prices at the mass retail level however haven\'t risen much in a decade partly because big retailers use tennis balls to lure shoppers

47hc041d The interior minister said at least twenty strikes have broken out and authorities extended a curfew and detained forty nine people nationwide 
47hc041e Some workers ended strikes yesterday but others prepared for assaults by troops and riot police 
47ic0201 A smaller market share still means substantial growth when the asset pool is vastly expanded notes George Collins president of T\. Rowe Price 
47ic0202 Nonetheless the firm has been paying more attention to the consumer aspects of the business 
47ic0203 [tongue_click] Retail clients currently account for about fifty seven \%PERCENT of the total twenty two billion of assets under management at T\. Rowe Price 
47ic0204 In nineteen seventy eight retail business accounted for about thirty five \%PERCENT of the firm\'s assets 
47ic0205 Already . a- arbitragers estimate industrywide losses in the takeover stock sell off that followed the Boesky news at between one billion and two billion dollars 
47ic0206 Some say a few of their colleagues lost the entire year\'s profit in the week after the Boesky announcement . November fourteenth 
47ic0207 [tongue_click] Others watched glumly as their annual bonuses withered along with prices of takeover stocks 
47ic0208 London\'s one hundred share index fell eight \.POINT six points to close at twenty two seventy five its low for the day 
47ic0209 The Financial Times sh- thirty share index was thirteen \.POINT three points lower at seventeen seventy five \.POINT two 
47ic020a The gold mines index fell thirteen \.POINT two to f:our fifty four \.POINT two 
47ic020b Volume was four hundred eighty seven \.POINT six million shares compared with three hundred ninety four \.POINT seven million Monday 
47ic020c Frankfurt shares tumbled in response to the weaker dollar and the decline on Wall Street Wednesday brokers said 
47ic020d Many blue chip issues lost as much as two \%PERCENT with a few dropping as much as four \%PERCENT 
47ic020e *Financial* shares were hit hardest amid fears of higher interest rates 
47ic020f Inevitably some will seek a fourth [um] alternative [loud_breath] to continue borrowing from the rest of the world making only marginal adjustments in our economic policies 
47ic020g Earlier this century the British taught us that debt . and leadership cannot l:ong co exist 
47ic020h Eventually and the markets seem to be saying sooner rather than later we will have to choose 
47ic020i [tongue_click] We saw it with oil and we\'re seeing it with gold says John Dessauer an Orleans Massachusetts money manager 
47ic020j When the price gets high enough all these new reserves open up eventually knocking down prices he says 
47ic020k He adds that he expects gold will soon retreat to below four hundred dollars 
47ic020l Articles began appearing about the rise of the l- religious right a group that seemed to be dealt with more as anthropology than journalism 
47ic020m After watching evangelical T\. V\. ministers Norman Lear began spending his fortune on a group called People for the American Way 
47ic020n Much of this swamp creature treatment came to a head in the nineteen eighty six lawsuits over creationism and secular humanism in school texts 
47ic020o [tongue_click] The establishment made virtually no effort to push below the surface of these grievances 
47ic020p Bids totaling four hundred and sixty million were submitted 
47ic020q Accepted bids ranged from six \.POINT six one eight \%PERCENT to six \.POINT six three \%PERCENT 
47ic020r Citicorp slated another f:ifty million dollar s:ale next Tuesday 
47ic020s NATO leaders ended a two day summit in Brussels 
47ic020t The alliance issued a communique that stressed its determination to decide on a comprehensive approach to further arms control treaties 
47ic020u But it sidestepped decisions on divisive issues such as modernizing the short range nuclear weapons based in West Germany 
47ic020v [tongue_click] Unfair or not the questions are being asked about both the revolution\'s route and its goals How much violence will there be 
47ic020w Will whites have political rights 
47ic020x How many whites will lose their jobs 
47ic020y How Communist is the A\. N\. C\. 
47ic020z How much will the government control the economy 
47ic0210 In January signs of a weakening economy prompted Chairman Greenspan and Vice Chairman Johnson to push through a slight easing of policy allowing interest rates to fall 
47ic0211 Governor Angell worried by the strong commodity prices was reluctant to go along 
47ic0212 And several district bank presidents later bristled because they weren\'t consulted 
47ic0213 The rehab:ilitation process is certainly further along 
47ic0214 There\'s less looking back and more looking forward now Mr\. LeF:evre said 
47ic0215 [tongue_click] People are focusing more on the election and the post election period what it might mean for the economy 
47ic0216 Analysts and franchisees alike pointed to what they regarded as an about face on Burger King by Pillsbury\'s new chairman and chief executive officer Philip L\. Smith 
47ic0217 In his maiden speech to Pillsbury shareholders on September thirteenth Mr\. Smith said reviving the chain was his top priority 
47ic0218 [tongue_click] He called it one of Pillsbury\'s best opportunites for growth 
47ic0219 Moreover fiercely competitive organizations often shy away from courtroom confrontations over business tactics because of questions of image 
47ic021a The macho mentality of many corporate board rooms disdains defamation suits because they make a company look whiny says Mr\. Hanson 
47ic021b Most companies he says are afraid to look as if they can\'t take the competition 
47ic021c [tongue_click] An Upjohn spokesman said the com:pany planned to market Rogaine to women all along 
47ic021d However F\. D\. A\. approval for using drug on men came first because Upjohn didn\'t test the product on enough women initially 
47ic021e Upjohn said it began testing Rogaine on women in nineteen eighty seven about four years after tests on balding men began 
47ic0301 [tongue_click] Like their economies the currencies of the U\. S\. and Canada are closely related 
47ic0302 But as interest rates rise in Canada the Canadian dollar is gaining on its U\. S\. counterpart traders and analysts say 
47ic0303 [tongue_click] And as the Canadian unit rises it lures more foreign investment particularly from Japan which adds to its strength 
47ic0304 The Treasury rules however contain modifications [loud_breath] of the S\. E\. C\. rules designed to improve protection of parties involved in repurchase agreements 
47ic0305 In such agreements called repos one party sells government securities to another with the understanding that the seller will repurchase them later at a specified price 
47ic0306 The proposed modifications would apply to government securities brokers or dealers that are already registered as well <as> as to newly registered entities 
47ic0307 Nevertheless interest rates fell [loud_breath] on short term Treasury bills sold yesterday at the government\'s weekly auction 
47ic0308 The average rate on new thirteen week bills declined to five \.POINT five nine \%PERCENT from five \.POINT eight one \%PERCENT at last week\'s sale 
47ic0309 [loud_breath] The average rate on new twenty six week bills fell to five \.POINT nine nine \%PERCENT from [loud_breath] six \.POINT one \%PERCENT the previous week 
47ic030a We are aware of our international obligations and we willingly accept them the banker observes 
47ic030b But the Bundesbank he asserts has to be very cautious in setting this monetary policy 
47ic030c From our point of view we already have a permissive policy he says 
47ic030d [tongue_click] Doug is much more aggressive in the *marketplace* says James E\. Sorenson Battelle\'s senior vice president for manufacturing 
47ic030e He gets out and has one on one meetings with chief executives of companies and learns where the market is going 
47ic030f [loud_breath] Battelle must anticipate commercial demand five to eight years ahead Mr\. Sorenson adds 
47ic030g Prices on the upscale Acura division\'s base model cars jumped even higher than the Honda division\'s prices 
47ic030h The Acura Integra jumped three \.POINT five \%PERCENT [loud_breath] or three hundred and seventy dollars to [loud_breath] ten thousand nine hundred and fifteen dollars 
47ic030i The luxury Legend sedan increased in price two \.POINT five \%PERCENT [loud_breath] or five hundred and twenty five dollars to twenty three thousand six hundred and seventy five dollars 
47ic030j [tongue_click] And the Legend coupe rose two \.POINT five \%PERCENT or five hundred and seventy nine dollars to twenty three thousand six hundred and seventy five dollars 
47ic030k Foul weather was also blamed by a spokesman for Pan Am the first place finisher in December 
47ic030l Weather particularly affected flights in the Northeast and Europe where most of Pan Am\'s routes are located he said 
47ic030m He added that Pan Am nonetheless turned in one of the best performances among major carriers 
47ic030n [tongue_click] He predicted the next report will show a rebound for the airline in February 
47ic030o To be sure a few companies are trying to use the Olympics to make [loud_breath] the transition from a subcontractor [loud_breath] to an internationally known brand 
47ic030p Kukje Corp\. shifted from producing Nike shoes to developing its own Pro Specs line of athletic shoes five years ago 
47ic030q It paid four \.POINT five million dollars in cash and goods to be an official sponsor of the games and has been highlighting the logo in its advertising 
47ic030r [tongue_click] Kukje hopes the Olympics will help give Pro Specs a foothold in Europe 
47ic030s Viewers and critics say the huge load of ads and airtime is part of the problem 
47ic030t [tongue_click] Commercial clutter seems greater than in many previous Olympics broadcasts many critics say 
47ic030u [tongue_click] The coverage between ads some complain is fragmented and shifty jumping too quickly among myriad sports 
47ic030v [tongue_click] Actual events as opposed to taped profiles previews and reports take up less than half of the airtime 
47ic030w Many headline events don\'t appear until after midnight 
47ic030x The study was part of *Cornell\'s* response to calls by local politicians that it should help more in Tompkins County 
47ic030y [loud_breath] When the schools were ranked by operating budgets or value of buildings Cornell\'s one \.POINT two million dollar payments were found to be near the bottom of the list 
47ic030z [tongue_click] In pre student payments Cornell ranked seventh at seventy dollars 
47ic0310 [tongue_click] Mr\. Delchamps said thirty \%PERCENT of the company\'s stock outstanding is held by the people who have agreed !not to sell their holdings before October thirty first 
47ic0311 Another twenty five \%PERCENT is held under the company\'s employee stock ownership plan 
47ic0312 Most of the people in the former category are expected to extend the no sell agreement for another year he said 
47ic0313 [tongue_click] The lower volatility could be es!pecially important right now when the course of interest rates seems especially cloudy 
47ic0314 While interest rates have been declining recently many economists expect rates to rise by year end 
47ic0315 [tongue_click] After that however they say rates could fall again perhaps sharply as economic growth slows in nineteen eighty nine 
47ic0316 Jackson Democrats see Mr\. Jackson as an activist strong leader who is more willing to take risks than those in the often blander congressional wing of the party 
47ic0317 [loud_breath] He clearly commands the Democrats\' most loyal constituency 
47ic0318 It is never wise to ignore those you can depend on says S:onia Jarvis of the National Coalition on Black Voter Participation 
47ic0319 In April Drexel agreed to pay six hundred and fifty million dollars and plead guilty to six felony counts related to a federal insider trading investigation 
47ic031a [tongue_click] The plea agreement was made in conjunction with a broad settlement of securities law [tongue_click] violations with the Securities and Exchange Commission 
47ic031b [tongue_click] Because the firm agreed that it committed felonies securities commissioners in most states can automatically revoke Drexel\'s license to do business 
47ic031c [tongue_click] Why this incredible diversion of effort to crimes that often are not clearly defined by statute [loud_breath] and where identifiable victims are seldom found 
47ic031d Maybe too many of today\'s prosecutors were influenced by the prevailing counterculture suspicions of middle class m- morality during their law school days 
47ic031e But another answer is simpler It is easier to extract plea bargains from traders [loud_breath] with a mere mention of R\. I\. C\. O\. than from real felons 
47ic0401 [tongue_click] As a longtime member of the Anaheim California 
47ic0402 Redevelopment Commission the retired food company executive took pride in helping his city grow 
47ic0403 [tongue_click] But he also loved the free silver pass that Disneyland gave him every year as one of nearly one thousand local notables so honored 
47ic0404 Despite all the uncertainty that surrounded British Petroleum\'s jumbo offering there wasn\'t that much turmoil in the market when shares began to trade Friday 
47ic0405 B\. P\.\'s partially paid American depositary shares closed unchanged [loud_breath] at seventeen and one quarter with thirteen \.POINT two million traded 
47ic0406 It was the Big Board\'s most active issue 
47ic0407 During the past several days corporations and other big investors have refrained from lending Treasury bonds and notes to securities dealers for brief periods 
47ic0408 That in turn has forced many dealers to refrain from selling borrowed securities or amassing so called short positions 
47ic0409 [loud_breath] It\'s hard to short anything in this market at the moment said a trader at a large government securities dealer 
47ic040a [tongue_click] Most analysts said the *international* operations of the two banks make a good fit 
47ic040b [loud_breath] Generale de Banque has a strong network in Africa while Amro has more operations in the Middle East and Far East 
47ic040c [loud_breath] And while Generale de Banque has an important commercial banking operation Amro has more experience in brokerage and investment services for its clients 
47ic040d Things are a bit duller this year 
47ic040e Mr\. Bilzerian has sent his boy to a Little League team in faraway Minnesota where the family spends its summers and isn\'t coaching a team this year 
47ic040f All the action apparently will be in the courtroom 
47ic040g [loud_breath] It\'s a situation where we are learning our way with the Allante the spokesman said 
47ic040h The car is doing the things that we want it to do for us as far as getting visibility for the division [loud_breath] and being an image car 
47ic040i Since it\'s been a new entity for Cadillac and our dealers we weren\'t quite sure what the actual sales volume would be 
47ic040j Clayton who at age seventy has been around a bit longer isn\'t quite so sure 
47ic040k All I can say is that I hope Mike\'s mind is straight he says 
47ic040l I also hope that someone somewhere gives him some good advice before he does something very unwise 
47ic040m [tongue_click] Mr\. Viet has bigger worries 
47ic040n [tongue_click] Apart from uncooperative targets the paper and its thirty two journalists face a challenge to become more professional he says 
47ic040o Criticizing shortcomings isn\'t enough 
47ic040p We have to recognize achievements 
47ic040q [tongue_click] We have to develop judgment and that isn\'t easy 
47ic040r [tongue_click] Mr\. Chatichai\'s wealthy family background and his family\'s large property interests give him a good understanding of the business community 
47ic040s Further he has good relations with the large ethnic Chinese community and serves as chairman of the Thai Chinese Friendship Association 
47ic040t That\'s important for the country\'s business elite many of whom are ethnic Chinese 
47ic040u [loud_breath] And it doesn\'t appear that cable owners will resist the change 
47ic040v [loud_breath] A spokesman for the National Cable Television Association said [loud_breath] We don\'t oppose [loud_breath] the proposal in principle 
47ic040w [loud_breath] We take the position that the more people in the cable market the better 
47ic040x New York City\'s Board of Education would disagree 
47ic040y My high school\'s administration would too 
47ic040z Also my union the United Federation of Teachers and every Republican [loud_breath] and Democrat who has ever run for public office !anywhere 
47ic0410 And most *vehemently* of all the League of Women Voters 
47ic0411 Benetton denies all charges on the specific accusations by unhappy store owners [loud_breath] and steadfastly maintains that i- it isn\'t a franchise operation and thus isn\'t subject to franchise requirements 
47ic0412 [tongue_click] Store owners it says are licensees because they own their stores and don\'t pay royalties to Benetton as franchisees typically do 
47ic0413 Although it acknowledges that a few store owners have complained it blames any problems on the owners themselves or on its field representatives who deal directly with them 
47ic0414 Despite the problems with the Claridge Mr\. Wynn didn\'t rule out an eventual return to the Atlantic City gambling scene 
47ic0415 [loud_breath] It\'s disappointing he said of the failed proposal 
47ic0416 But this is a l- very lively market and we haven\'t given up yet 
47ic0417 The market for home gear is growing as spending shifts [loud_breath] from apparel to the home says Kurt Barnard of the Retail Marketing Report New York 
47ic0418 He says sales at home related stores are growing ninety s- one \%PERCENT faster than at department stores and seventy five \%PERCENT faster than at apparel stores 
47ic0419 The trend is making the market less dependent on hou:sing market cycles says Carl Steidtmann chief economist of Management Horizons Dublin Ohio 
47ic041a While second quarter housing starts were down thirty \%PERCENT from two years ago furniture sales were up eighteen \%PERCENT he says 
47ic041b These mixed feelings of frustration with and gratitude toward the authorities are part of the everyday life of a foreigner doing business in Korea 
47ic041c In fact such contradictions are what seem to make the Korean world go round 
47ic041d A Western businessman needs to be ready for them 
47ic041e Here are a few hard learned facts of Korean business life 
47jc0201 Mr\. Grant was traveling and unavailable for comment 
47jc0202 Other officials of Grant Broadcasting aren\'t authorized to comment on any aspects of the case aides to Mr\. Grant said 
47jc0203 The company\'s bankruptcy case lawyer in Philadelphia wasn\'t available for comment 
47jc0204 Mr\. Shlenker couldn\'t be reached 
47jc0205 Because of that some Wall Street professionals think the stock looks rather expensive 
47jc0206 It has tripled since nineteen eighty five largely on takeover speculation 
47jc0207 It currently trades at about nine times cash flow says Alan Gaines of Gaines Berland an institutional brokerage firm 
47jc0208 That\'s about a thirty \%PERCENT premium to quality oil companies like Royal Dutch Petroleum Exxon and Mobil he says 
47jc0209 To these ends K\. P\. C\. enjoys a huge economic advantage 
47jc020a It costs Kuwait about a dollar to pump a barrel of oil and another fifty cents to bring it to Europe 
47jc020b The production cost of North Sea oil by contrast runs between eight dollars and thirteen dollars a barrel 
47jc020c The big difference disturbs European oil men 
47jc020d [tongue_click] The question was what form this conflict would take 
47jc020e The Civil War was finally fought over maintaining the Union 
47jc020f But what if there had been no Union 
47jc020g What if the South had been a separate nation 
47jc020h Would Southerners black or white have ever achieved full equality if they had been incorporated into the union as a conquered province 
47jc020i Or what if the war had been avoided and slavery just drifted on and on 
47jc020j [tongue_click] Would the South have become another South Africa 
47jc020k I wouldn\'t bet against it 
47jc020l It still isn\'t clear what form the increases will take or when they will go into effect 
47jc020m [tongue_click] Some carriers said they plan to raise fares Sunday and others said they will act a week later 
47jc020n [tongue_click] Some airlines also said the increases won\'t affect their lowest discount fares 
47jc020o In addition Laurentian said Bernhard M\. Koch thirty three was named vice president and chief financial officer 
47jc020p He succeeds John Strom who transferred to a Laurentian Capital unit 
47jc020q Previously Mr\. Koch was director of internal audit at Laurentian Group Corporation and Imperial Life Assurance Company of Canada majority shareholders of Laurentian Capital 
47jc020r But they may not be trying hard enough or at least not in the right ways 
47jc020s They need only listen to the group of eight women gathered here for a discussion of what they like and what they don\'t about the latest trends in fashion retailing 
47jc020t Manufacturers would swiftly learn that their clothes often aren\'t right for women who work while retailers would find that they haven\'t sufficiently taken into account their customers\' busy lives 
47jc020u [tongue_click] New York City\'s Board of Education would disagree 
47jc020v My high school\'s administration would too

47jc020y Chemical\'s Texas Commerce Bancshares Inc\. unit reported profit of six \.POINT eight million dollars 
47jc020z [tongue_click] That figure includes a thirteen million dollar gain from intercompany income tax benefits under the corporation\'s tax sharing agreement 
47jc0210 [tongue_click] In the year ago quarter Texas Commerce had a loss of thirteen \.POINT five million dollars which included a special charge from the restructuring 
47jc0211 Chemical acquired Texas Commerce in May nineteen eighty seven 
47jc0212 The Richmond Virginia media concern said sales and profits from its newsprint operations were ahead of year earlier levels 
47jc0213 Its cable system continued to gain subscribers now totaling more than one hundred and fifty seven thousand 
47jc0214 Revenue per subscriber is exceeding forecasts Media General said adding that it plans to increase rates an average of eight \%PERCENT beginning in January 
47jc0215 Prices gradually moved higher through midafternoon when the market peaked and then started its retreat 
47jc0216 Philip Puccio manager of institutional trading at Dillon Read and Company said some institutions used the advance as an opportunity to do some selling 
47jc0217 [tongue_click] They\'ve been peeling off some stock to take advantage of better prices he said 
47jc0218 During the spring and summer the Fed nudged up short term interest rates to restrain the economy 
47jc0219 But worried as always about becoming a political football the Fed tried to keep a low profile in the weeks before the election 
47jc021a That strategy was helped by an apparent slowdown in economic growth in the third quarter which eased inflation worries and allowed the Fed to stop pushing up rates 
47jc021b [tongue_click] In the year earlier quarter the La Jolla California industrial and investment concern had a restated loss of fifty seven million dollars 
47jc021c The results were restated to reflect discontinued operations and the consolidation of its Signal Landmark Holdings Inc\. unit a real estate developer [misc_noise] 
47jc021d Revenue for the last quarter rose sixty one \%PERCENT to four hundred and seven million dollars from two hundred and fifty three million dollars 
47jc021e Frank Robinson the Hall of Fame hitter who\'s the O\'s manager takes a like tack 
47jc021f We\'re no powerhouse but we\'ve taken advantage of our opportunities h- says he

47jc0301 A spokeswoman for C\. B\. S\. said there are serious issues and we\'re trying our best to find solutions while operating in a very demanding economic climate 
47jc0302 [tongue_click] We\'re continuing to bargain 
47jc0303 Capital Cities \/SLASH A\. B\. C\. declined to comment on the talks 
47jc0304 Brokerage stocks have been wilting for months but Mr\. Chanos thinks they could get hit later this year if other firms report down quarters 
47jc0305 Salomon\'s stock dived eleven \%PERCENT on huge volume Monday casting a temporary pall over the whole group 
47jc0306 It closed yesterday at thirty nine and seven eighths up one eighth 
47jc0307 [tongue_click] Some have characterized our countermeasures as protectionist brought about because of congressional pressures 
47jc0308 That is dead wrong 
47jc0309 We have been in consultations with Japan on this issue since November long before present trade legislation was introduced 
47jc030a The president\'s action was the culmination of that process and it had nothing whatsoever to do with trade bills 
47jc030b President Reagan believes that people and nations should honor their obligations 
47jc030c There is nothing protectionist about that 
47jc030d Such cost cutting efforts have worsened labor disputes which have in turn pitted non union pilots against pro union pilots 
47jc030e First Officer Guy Casey was once a captain at Continental but lost his seniority during the bitter strike there in nineteen eighty three which he had helped to organize 
47jc030f He says he wants to put the experience behind him 
47jc030g Analysts also said they hadn\'t expected lower operating profits for the company\'s Industries Group and for the broadcasting segment 
47jc030h Westinghouse officials told analysts that operating profit in the Industries Group fell fifteen \%PERCENT to twenty \%PERCENT hurt in part by weak results in Canadian operations 
47jc030i A sharp drop in operating profit from the Broadcasting Group\'s production company contributed to the slightly lower operating earnings overall for that segment 
47jc030j The spokesman also said the league\'s owners are committed to playing with their current replacement rosters for the rest of the season including the Super Bowl if necessary 
47jc030k That may be the case if Mr\. Upshaw can be taken at his word 
47jc030l He has said that the players will remain on strike for the duration if the union\'s offer was rejected 
47jc030m The Soviets obviously want to make it as difficult as possible for NATO to carry out its modernization said one Western diplomat in Bonn 
47jc030n A senior NATO diplomat accused the Soviets of trying to seduce the Germans away from us 
47jc030o It is none too subtle wedge driving he told Reuters 
47jc030p We never had one before Mr\. Timbers said 
47jc030q A certain percentage of our clients would like to have that option 
47jc030r [tongue_click] It\'s not necessarily a m:arket call 
47jc030s Mr\. Timbers says he\'s fairly ambivalent about the price of gold near term 
47jc030t He does see however higher inflation of five \%PERCENT or so in nineteen eighty nine up from four \%PERCENT this year 
47jc030u [tongue_click] A gold option could be a nice alternative for fixed income investors should inflation fears arise Mr\. Timbers says 
47jc030v [tongue_click] Some economists say inflationary pressures could continue to push up U\. S\. interest rates this year 
47jc030w If so foreign central banks may see that as an *opportunity* to tighten and to address their own inflation worries despite U\. S\. concerns 
47jc030x One fear says Irving Trust economist Robert McGee is that higher global rates will send the financial markets into a tailspin 
47jc030y A similar view is held by Greta E\. Marshall investment manager of the California Public Employees\' Retirement System which manages about forty four \.POINT four billion dollars 
47jc030z I still see no evidence that inflation is picking up substantially she says 
47jc0310 [tongue_click] The economy doesn\'t look so strong that it will rekindle inflation so I would view any further drop in bond prices as a buying opportunity 
47jc0311 [lip_smack] Alas they probably should have devoted a little more thought to Winnebago\'s past 
47jc0312 The company had a history of carnage at the top running through five different chief executives in the fourteen years before Messrs\. 
47jc0313 Gilbert and Berreth strolled into town 
47jc0314 In one of those shake ups Winnebago\'s chairman and founder John K\. Hanson sacked his own son 
47jc0315 [tongue_click] Here are price trends on the world\'s major stock markets as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective Geneva 
47jc0316 To make them directly comparable each index is based on the close of nineteen sixty nine equaling one hundred 
47jc0317 The percentage change is since year end 
47jc0318 [tongue_click] After nearly eight years of the Reagan presidency a kind of morning after mood prevails here 
47jc0319 [tongue_click] There is a sense that Mr\. Reagan\'s successor hasn\'t any choice but to be a consolidation president 
47jc031a Given budget constraints and a re energized Congress some here believe a Bush administration may not be all that different from a Dukakis administration 
47jc031b Some of that cash has been used for bonus payments 
47jc031c Wages and bonuses rose nineteen \%PERCENT in the first half a rate that far outpaced economic growth and exerted upward pressure on prices 
47jc031d China\'s economy grew at an annual rate of five \.POINT seven \%PERCENT in the first six months roughly half the average annual rate in the past decade 
47jc0401 [tongue_click] Texas started evaluating potential S\. S\. C\. sites about four years ago and now has solid data on six locations says Dillard Hammett state energy adviser 
47jc0402 Four more communities have since asked to be included 
47jc0403 Considering the state\'s flat relatively earthquake free landscape Mr\. Hammett says ninety five \%PERCENT of Texas could have the site 
47jc0404 The banks sought to eliminate a mismatch between their assets predominantly held in non pound currencies and their capital kept in pounds 
47jc0405 When the pound was weak during the early nineteen eighties the value of Scandinavian Bank\'s capital fell steeply in proportion to its non dollar assets 
47jc0406 The banks that owned Scandinavian Bank had to inject about forty seven \.POINT seven million dollars of additional capital 
47jc0407 Also the strong rise in share prices in recent weeks appears to have discontinued most of the good news likely in the budget another dealer said 
47jc0408 It\'s going to take quite a lot to move it sharply ahead from this level he said 
47jc0409 The hundred share index is up eighteen \.POINT six \%PERCENT this year 
47jc040a The book he says will be about Arvida and generally about companies snared in the takeover game 
47jc040b It will ask some pointed questions Is there value added in corporate mergers 
47jc040c Does productivity increase and what happens to the people involved 
47jc040d The premier said it would be better for Mr\. Ghafar to remain as his deputy

47jc040h [misc_noise] S\. D\. I\. perpetuates the illusion that more weapons equals more security 
47jc040i Our dependence upon violence to resolve conflict is a short tern solution to a long term problem 
47jc040j In order to ensure our survival we must change the way we think about conflict 
47jc040k By spending billions of dollars on developing nonviolent means of resolving conflict we can build a world beyond war and a sustainable secure future for all people 
47jc040l Steven N\. Kincaid president said Kincaid\'s board would review the announcement when it meets sometime in the next few weeks [misc_noise] 
47jc040m He declined to comment further 
47jc040n He said he and his father J\. Wade Kincaid who is chairman own a total of about six \.POINT four \%PERCENT of the company\'s common 
47jc040o Art collectors and dealers heaved a sigh of relief last night 
47jc040p After high prices and *frantic* bidding at art auctions last spring about one in four works didn\'t sell at a contemporary art auction at Christie\'s 
47jc040q But at least the market didn\'t crash 
47jc040r Gemfibrozil has long been known to increase H\. D\. L\. but until this report its effect on heart disease was unclear 
47jc040s [tongue_click] Available in the U\. S\. since nineteen eighty two gemfibrozil gained only limited use 
47jc040t [tongue_click] That is because gemfibrozil only moderately reduces L\. D\. L\. compared with other drugs 
47jc040u In export led electrical and computer makers Kyocera slipped ninety to five thousand twenty 
47jc040v Matsushita Electric Industrial was unchanged at two thousand and seventy

47jc040y [loud_breath] Certain elements of a national system were obvious and quickly made their way into use 
47jc040z [tongue_click] The first was a composite tape that brought information from various market centers onto one ticker tape 
47jc0410 A composite quotation display system soon followed allowing customers and brokers to see quotes from all markets on a single screen 
47jc0411 [tongue_click] And an Intermarket Trading System allowed orders coming to various exchange floors to flow from one exchange to another quickly easily and at no cost 
47jc0412 [tongue_click] In my original squad I\'m the only one left unharmed 
47jc0413 In my platoon there\'s only thirteen of us 
47jc0414 It seems everyday another young guy eighteen to nineteen years old like myself is killed in action 
47jc0415 Israeli Defense Minister Rabin said he had met with Palestinians to search for ways to end violence in the occupied territories 
47jc0416 But Arabs involved in the talks during the past few days said Rabin had nothing to offer and that the six month old rebellion would continue 
47jc0417 Israel\'s army said two hundred and seven Palestinians have been killed in the unrest 
47jc0418 Prudential Insurance Company of America which participated in the nineteen eighty five buy out holds about a thirty \%PERCENT stake in Foodmaker 
47jc0419 A Foodmaker spokesman declined yesterday to comment on any involvement Prudential may have in the latest buy out proposal 
47jc041a [tongue_click] Certain Foodmaker executives also may buy stakes in F\. M\. Acquisition the company said 
47jc041b In other developments corn and wheat prices were mostly higher in a rebound from Monday\'s session when corn set new life of contract lows 
47jc041c Many traders bought contracts to cover short or selling positions 
47jc041d Analysts said technical factors also played a part as prices backed and filled the gaps left on price charts by Monday\'s steep drop 
47kc0201 Kidder Peabody founded four years earlier long has been a socially well connected and profitable investment bank 
47kc0202 But its power on Wall Street ebbed in recent years as it was overtaken by larger more aggressive firms 
47kc0203 Kidder officials have recently hoped that its link with General Electric and G\. E\.\'s large amount of capital would restore it to its earlier preeminence 
47kc0204 [tongue_click] We had to scour the earth to achieve that settlement Mr\. Liebmann said 
47kc0205 [tongue_click] But through it all [tongue_click] Ralph was calm and rational

47kc0207 Pacific Telesis is the second regional Bell company seeking to participate in international long distance service 
47kc0208 New York based Nynex Corporation is a member of another group that wants to lay a transatlantic phone cable on the ocean floor 
47kc0209 Both companies serve large numbers of business and financial customers and see international transmission of data as a large growth market 
47kc020a By and large OPEC is prepared to sit it out said a senior OPEC minister who asked not to be identified 
47kc020b There may be some weaker members among us but OPEC as a whole isn\'t overproducing 
47kc020c [tongue_click] The problem is speculation by traders that verges on psychological warfare 
47kc020d We\'ve entered a period where economic forces are producing tremendous strains on business says Lawrence O\'Brien a tax lobbyist 
47kc020e As a result you can no longer come up with an effective consensus among business groups on important issues 
47kc020f Adds Mr\. Shapiro When business speaks with two voices it tends not to be heard 
47kc020g Dayton Hudson may get some things it didn\'t request from the Minnesota legislature 
47kc020h Some political leaders are discussing whether to amend the Dayton Hudson proposal to ban such controversial management takeover defenses [loud_breath] as golden parachutes [tongue_click] poison pills and greenmail payments 
47kc020i This should be a two way street said Michael Hatch commissioner of the Minnesota Commerce Department 
47kc020j Managements shouldn\'t be entrenched 
47kc020k An index of long term Treasury bonds compiled by Shearson Lehman Brothers Incorporated sank to its lowest level since June two 
47kc020l [tongue_click] The index fell four \.POINT eight seven points to twelve hundred sixty three \.POINT seven zero 
47kc020m That was only slightly above its low for the day of twelve hundred sixty two \.POINT six four 
47kc020n The high was twelve hundred seventy four \.POINT two nine 
47kc020o And that figure doesn\'t include gambling revenue 
47kc020p Casinos are flush with high rollers when a big fight comes to town enabling them to raise minimum table bets sky high 
47kc020q In Atlantic City [tongue_click] it took one hundred dollars to elbow into the Trump Plaza craps game the night of the Michael Spinks Gerry Cooney [loud_breath] heavyweight fight in June 
47kc020r Many blackjack tables had a minimum bet of five hundred dollars

47kc020x Portugal\'s prime minister said his nation wants to review a nineteen eighty three defense pact but isn\'t seeking a cut in U\. S\. military forces in the country 
47kc020y Cavaco Silva who met at the White House with Reagan urged increased aid 
47kc020z But Reagan said all nations hosting American military bases must !share the pain from U\. S\. budget cuts 
47kc0210 [tongue_click] The order carried out the ship takes off at flank speed from the Barents headed south to avoid detection 
47kc0211 Then inexplicably a few hours later all communication vanishes 
47kc0212 None with Washington none with other ships no signals from the usual commercial stations anywhere in the world 
47kc0213 Moreover Mr\. Fair\'s predictions tend to improve with age 
47kc0214 Back in nineteen seventy six he was giving President Ford the incumbent\'s four point advantage 
47kc0215 After the election he took it away 
47kc0216 Unlike Lyndon Johnson Mr\. Ford wasn\'t ever elected vice president Mr\. Fair explains feebly 
47kc0217 When Mr\. Fair presents the results of his equation today it still shows a Ford victory but by a less embarrassing margin 
47kc0218 Such plans make educators cringe 
47kc0219 They worry that a college degree could be reduced to a few trips to the notes supermarket 
47kc021a My guess is that it will quickly become widespread because of peer pressure laments Randy Knight vice chairman for undergraduate studies in Ohio State\'s physics department 
47kc021b Standard and Poor\'s Corporation put this personnel services concern\'s seventy four \.POINT eight million dollars of B\. plus rated convertible subordinated debt on CreditWatch with negative implications 
47kc021c The move follows the disclosure last week that investment banker Gibbons Green van Amerongen Limited plans a two step acquisition of a substantial stake in Robert Half 
47kc021d A Robert Half official said the company is convinced that our debt coverage will be strong and we don\'t think the risks will be unreasonable 
47kc021e Now his laughter is gone 
47kc021f Because of drugs he is dead 
47kc021g And every day my heart breaks a little more 
47kc0301 Sources close to Goldman Sachs said that federal marshals had roped off the firm\'s takeover trading area and were carting off documents yesterday afternoon [tongue_click] 
47kc0302 [tongue_click] They added that Mr\. Freeman hadn\'t been subpoenaed and that the firm hadn\'t had any warning that any government action was imminent 
47kc0303 Everyone is in total shock said one employee 
47kc0304 But while nickel and especially copper quotes have since rebounded aluminum prices have continued to tumble 
47kc0305 It seems to be in people\'s interest to keep the price down right now says one London exchange trader 
47kc0306 [tongue_click] This will ultimately give them more buying opportunities down the line 
47kc0307 The nineteen seventy two A\. B\. M\. treaty requires a review every five years [loud_breath] 
47kc0308 Communiques announcing completion of the first and second reviews were issued November fourth nineteen seventy seven and November ninth nineteen eighty two [loud_breath] 
47kc0309 The third review was due by October third nineteen eighty seven [loud_breath] 
47kc030a The most optimistic estimates are now that it will start sometime after the first of the year 
47kc030b The Reagan administration in short is conspiring with the Soviets to violate the review provisions of the treaty 
47kc030c No one seems quite sure how the publisher juggles his assets among his various companies which include the publicly owned Maxwell Communication Corporation and various private ones 
47kc030d Control of the public company and of private interests like Mirror Group Newspapers Limited rests with a foundation in Liechtenstein Pergamon Holding Foundation [tongue_click] about which little is disclosed 
47kc030e He says its beneficiaries are charities which he promises to identify someday soon 
47kc030f [tongue_click] The optimism is widespread [loud_breath] 
47kc030g The association said s- fifty seven \%PERCENT predicted nineteen eighty eight will be better than nineteen eighty seven while only thirteen \%PERCENT expected a worse year 
47kc030h That is the highest total to forecast a better future year in December since nineteen eighty three [tongue_click] when eighty six \%PERCENT were expecting stronger growth 
47kc030i President Reagan who was in Durham North Carolina was cautious about the Soviet offer 
47kc030j I\'m waiting to see what the conditions are he said 
47kc030k A senior administration official however called the Gorbachev statement a watershed event because it will increase expectations among Soviet people for withdrawal 
47kc030l Regardless of how the foreign purchases begin they often involve the very parts that make weapons perform [loud_breath] 
47kc030m For example F\. M\. C\. Corporation\'s Bradley Fighting Vehicle depends on a sophisticated sensor system from the Netherlands to inform soldiers of potential threats and targets 
47kc030n Without this part tucked into the turret of the armored vehicle [loud_breath] the Bradley would be comparatively helpless on the battlefield 
47kc030o Mr\. Iacocca said that while the pricing actions increased sales they also squeezed Chrysler\'s profit margins 
47kc030p But he added that the Number three U\. S\. auto maker made a conscious decision to sacrifice profit for the higher market share 
47kc030q That move is behind Chrysler\'s recent decisions to increase production [tongue_click] which in turn will boost profit for the rest of the year 
47kc030r The Cuomo plan doesn\'t stop at gouging New York taxpayers and Long Island ratepayers 
47kc030s Federal taxpayers also will contribute 
47kc030t The key to the deal is that Lilco also would get a two \.POINT five billion tax write off for Shoreham 
47kc030u This would guarantee that the utility won\'t have to pay any federal taxes for at least a decade 
47kc030v New York also would help Lilco float one hundred million in tax exempt industrial development bonds to help pay for the cleanup 
47kc030w Make that de industrialization bonds 
47kc030x [tongue_click] But network officials will spend months debating C\. B\. S\.\'s wisdom 
47kc030y It\'s time to be aggressive said Mr\. Pilson testily taking on reporters at yesterday\'s press conference 
47kc030z I\'m up here stating C\. B\. S\. has acquired the rights and N\. B\. C\. hasn\'t 
47kc0310 [tongue_click] At N\. B\. C\. Mr\. Watson was philosophic if pragmatic . You always want to be a winner he said 
47kc0311 But you don\'t want to commit suicide at the same time 
47kc0312 The total cut would correspond to the amount of coffee sold and not exceed eighteen thousand bags

47kc0315 In another trade dispute Kansai International Airport Corporation has come under attack 
47kc0316 Japan insists the company which is in charge of a new airport at Osaka is private and not subject to ministry orders 
47kc0317 Foreigners say that it is a semantic argument because nearly four fifths of the company\'s executives hail from government ministries 
47kc0318 Three years ago when the Moslem League came into the shared power arrangement Mr\. Ijaz Ali got into the provincial assembly 
47kc0319 There he wrung thousands of rupees from the government to build roads schools and electrification systems in his district

47kc031b Directly and indirectly the army plays an incalculable role in keeping Pakistan\'s distorted economy perking 
47kc031c Mr\. Jones the author notes that five hundred thousand Pakistani households four \%PERCENT of the economically active ones have sent young men into the army 
47kc031d Add in the households involved in services for the military and nearly ten \%PERCENT of the nation\'s households are involved 
47kc031e [loud_breath] U\. S\. intelligence about the terrorists is considered poor 
47kc031f It has proven difficult to infiltrate small terrorist cells which often are held together by family relationships 
47kc031g And during the nineteen eighties Lebanese terrorists killed two of the Central Intelligence Agency\'s top Middle East operatives Robert Ames and William Buckley 
47kc0401 As modest as the measures are even they won\'t be adopted without a struggle 
47kc0402 The tax cuts accepted by the coalition parties have been linked to cutbacks in federal subsidies 
47kc0403 Such reductions could rile special interest groups and undermine parliamentary support for the entire tax program 
47kc0404 Moreover [tongue_click] any tax reform must clear parliament\'s upper house the Bundesrat where the ruling Christian Democratic Union clings to a majority 
47kc0405 Some banks have already turned certain debts into securities which so far they have held rather than selling 
47kc0406 To get around Japanese government limits on debt reserves a group of Japanese banks turned some Third World debt into preferred stock earlier this year 
47kc0407 And Shearson is about to start marketing a mutual fund to banks that would allow the banks to swap Philippine debt for equity investments in that country 
47kc0408 The Japanese stock market is awash with liquidity Mr\. Grant says 
47kc0409 But in June suddenly with no apparent drainage it went down and kept going down he says 
47kc040a What is a mystery to Mr\. Grant and many others is that the Tokyo market has since staged a vigorous rebound 
47kc040b The Philip Morris magazine enjoys by far the highest circulation of any company magazine [tongue_click] seven \.POINT two million copies 
47kc040c The only requirement is that you have to be an adult to receive the magazine says Mary Taylor associate publisher 
47kc040d That\'s not because of racy articles but because the tobacco industry has been accused of trying to snatch twelve and thirteen year olds 
47kc040e Philip Morris is even considering selling space to outside advertisers it al:ready ran an ad for Time magazine on a test basis in its winter nineteen eighty seven issue [lip_smack]

47kc040i Mitsui and Company has a minority stake in a leveraged buy out fund that acquired control of Joseph Horne Company [loud_breath] in late nineteen eighty six 
47kc040j A chart in an earlier edition incorrectly listed Mitsui [tongue_click] its role and the date of the transaction

47kc040l The United Nations whose garbage bill is forty two thousand dollars a month is served by National Carting Company which won the pickup rights eight years ago 
47kc040m Last December the U\. N\. didn\'t attempt to solicit bids

47kc040p A big part of the reason for wood\'s success is the new techniques developed over the past five years for wood panels with a steel core 
47kc040q Besides narrowing the price difference between wood and metal systems these techniques provided the precision needed in designing panel systems that must fit together 
47kc040r Almost all the major office furniture manufacturers have acquired the ability to make wood systems in recent years 
47kc040s Still there are ways around the no documents dilemma

47kc0414 Last year after world stock prices crashed the market for domestic Japanese convertible bonds fell briefly 
47kc0415 By the start of this year convertible issues with a par value of more than four trillion yen were trading at below their issue price 
47kc0416 They quickly recovered though [loud_breath] thanks to a boom in the stock market and the relatively relaxed rate of new convertible bond issues

47lc0201 At this point competing developers were eyeing the project 
47lc0202 Under its ground lease with the city and state the partnership might be found in default on its contract enabling a competing developer to take over

47lc020r First Interstate\'s fourth quarter loss resulted from a previously announced one hundred eighty million dollar addition to its reserves against possible foreign debt losses 
47lc020s But even without the reserves the company said earnings would have been flat at about eighty five million dollars compared with the year earlier quarter 
47lc020t First Interstate had a slight decline in earnings assets and negligible growth in net interest income 
47lc020u Non interest income fell seventeen \%PERCENT partly because year earlier results included a nineteen \.POINT six million dollar pretax gain on the sale of a building 
47lc020v Pillsbury\'s loss compares with earnings of forty eight \.POINT five million dollars or fifty six cents a share in the year earlier quarter 
47lc020w Revenue fell two \%PERCENT in the latest period to one \.POINT five billion dollars from one \.POINT five three billion dollars 
47lc020x The revenue decline came from Pillsbury\'s restaurant business 
47lc020y That\'s a business decision that the manager has to make Mr\. Keane says 
47lc020z It\'s going to affect his return

47lc030k A spokesman for Mr\. Bacot says this A lot has happened in banking and the financial markets in the intervening years 
47lc030l The relevance of those comments to today\'s circumstances isn\'t very great 
47lc030m Mr\. Reagan vigorously defended Attorney General Edwin Meese who is under investigation for his role in advancing a Middle East oil pipeline advocated by one of Mr\. Meese\'s friends

47lc030p In the two selected areas the state will allow procurement and retail prices to rise to what the open market demands 
47lc030q The subsidy for consumers is meant to reduce the strain on urban residents 
47lc030r Farmers of course will get higher prices for their grain from the market which in turn should induce them to increase production 
47lc030s Grain production throughout China has faltered in recent years in part because state procurement prices were too low 
47lc030t Meanwhile share prices closed higher in Sydney Hong Kong Wellington Seoul and Manila and were lower in Singapore 
47lc030u Trading was described as light to moderate

47lc030w Grains and Soybeans The threat of rain and favorable spring planting conditions pushed soybean and corn futures prices lower 
47lc030x The latest weather forecast calls for fairly good moisture in Midwest farming states over the next six to ten days 
47lc030y Analysts said traders are shifting their emphasis away from last year\'s crop and to this year\'s 
47lc030z With this year\'s small acreage increases weather and spring planting conditions are major concerns to a market that is beginning to shake off a huge surplus 
47lc0310 The favorable conditions helped the soybean contract for November settlement close at six \.POINT eight two two five dollars a bushel down nine and a half cents 
47lc0311 Another executive explains the problems as the opposite of nineteen eighty seven 
47lc0312 Last year you had tumultuous swings in the markets themselves he says 
47lc0313 This year the environment will be narrower swings but volume will be lower with revenues insufficient to cover costs 
47lc0314 More important than arithmetic however is Mr\. Jackson\'s message 
47lc0315 Speaking to black aspirations he represents the best of the American dream

47lc0317 On the first day of the general strike factories closed but bookstores remained open in this old world cultural center 
47lc0318 Most schools were shut but Pushkin Street near the square reverberated as usual with the sound of badly played Chopin emanating from the open windows of the music academy 
47lc0319 Many of the Armenian demands are cultural 
47lc031a They want their old flag reinstated their children sent to Armenian schools rather than Russian ones their own language used on official documents 
47lc031b Their political demands include calls for a separate army brigade and the right for Armenia to have consulates abroad

47lc040a Still securities and banking regulators worry whether they are acting fast enough to safeguard against growing risks in the world\'s financial markets 
47lc040b Many agree there is little time to waste in the scramble to create better international regulation 
47lc040c As Mr\. Feldstein says You can\'t just look at the building and say it hasn\'t fallen down yet so we should be safe 
47lc040d With the initial financing complete L\. S\. I\. looked abroad in February nineteen eighty two for its next infusion 
47lc040e [loud_breath] We decided to go to investors who\'d pay a higher price explains Mr\. Corrigan 
47lc040f At the time Europeans were clamoring to invest in U\. S\. high technology and had few opportunities to participate directly in good deals he says 
47lc040g If we look at the record the debate should be rather short 
47lc040h The winners obvious 
47lc040i The only tragedy and it\'s an amazing one is that most Americans don\'t even know what has been accomplished and how it came about 
47lc040j But inside Room seven thirteen the Japanese see the situation somewhat differently 
47lc040k They reason like this If the U\. S\. imposes sanctions they most likely will be aimed at Japanese construction companies doing business in the U\. S\. 
47lc040l But that would hurt thousands of American workers who are employed either directly or indirectly by such companies 
47lc040m The political fallout for the Reagan administration might be too great to risk that

47lc040r If made practical they could bring spectacular changes to almost any electrical product or process 
47lc040s That could mean vastly faster and more energy efficient products such as computers cars and household appliances 
47lc040t [tongue_click] But until the recent breakthrough superconductors had to be chilled to a hopelessly low temperature to work so except for a few applications there really was no technology 
47lc040u Mr\. Iacocca said that while the pricing actions increased sales they also squeezed Chrysler\'s profit margins 
47lc040v But he added that the Number three U\. S\. auto maker made a conscious decision to sacrifice profit for a higher market share 
47lc040w That move is behind Chrysler\'s recent decisions to increase production which in turn will boost profit for the rest of the year 
47lc040x Critics argue that he may be overly optimistic though 
47lc040y And Mr\. Dukakis is certain to face more pressure on the question from Vice President Bush who supports both the M\. X\. and Midgetman 
47lc040z Moreover most of the members of Congress being considered as potential running mates for Governor Dukakis have backed one or the other missile plans 
47lc0410 The defense authorization bill pending in Congress is expected to put off any decision until a new administration takes office next year 
47lc0411 [tongue_click] Still Mr\. Love thinks he has the worst behind him 
47lc0412 Permian has bottomed out he says but he\'s using Intergroup\'s investment bankers to sound out prospective buyers anyway 
47lc0413 [loud_breath] To bolster the balance sheet he\'s also attempting to reach agreement later this year to sell to Japan\'s N\. K\. K\. the other half of its steel holdings

47mc0204 [loud_breath] Virtually everybody in the business complains about too many awards and most big agencies try to enter only the five or ten most prestigious contests

47mc0207 [tongue_click] You have to play the game 
47mc0208 Cleveland confronted scandals swiftly and with uncommon candor conceding from the outset for example his affair with Maria Halpin once it was exposed 
47mc0209 Yet he went to great lengths to conceal his cancer surgery 
47mc020a Mr\. Reagan on the other hand exposed his malignant bowels to the nation [loud_breath] but only grudgingly took responsibility for the Iran contra fiasco 
47mc020b [loud_breath] Meanwhile the agency said it will conduct a study on its own 
47mc020c Officials said the review may lead to new regulations for data processing systems

47mc020n The survey\'s composite index fell fifty eight \.POINT nine \%PERCENT in November from October\'s sixty one \.POINT eight \%PERCENT 
47mc020o A figure above fifty \%PERCENT indicates that the economy is generally expanding 
47mc020p [tongue_click] November marks the sixteenth consecutive month of expansion 
47mc020q Trading this week may indicate the market\'s direction with the Dow Jones industrials near the October nineteen low

47mc021e [lip_smack] I wanted to speculate he explains 
47mc0301 While all West German political parties agreed on the need for tax cuts of about twenty two billion dollars they differ on who should benefit 
47mc0302 The Social Democrats and the left wing Greens want the cuts to help the poor and the working class 
47mc0303 Within the ruling coalition the liberal Free Democrats and the Bavarian sister party of the Christian Democrats the Christian Socialists want cuts spread across the board 
47mc0304 Mr\. Funaro described as hot air and nonsense foreign bankers\' language in their criticism of Brazil\'s lack of economic policy 
47mc0305 He said nobody worried about Brazil\'s high inflation when the country was producing big surpluses to meet debt payments 
47mc0306 Instead of looking for excuses he said these banks should realize there\'s a debt crisis and it has to be resolved by both sides 
47mc0307 Kidder Peabody was fined twenty five \.POINT three million dollars by the S\. E\. C\. to settle insider trading and other charges 
47mc0308 The penalty is second only to Ivan Boesky\'s one hundred million dollar fine last fall [misc_noise] 
47mc0309 Kidder\'s settlement the first by a major firm in the insider trading scandal will allow the G\. E\. subsidiary to escape criminal prosecution

47mc030i He thought about opening a U\. S\. Latin America studies center in Mexico City [loud_breath] or setting up a consulting firm 
47mc030j [tongue_click] What happens now [other_mouth_sound] 
47mc030k That depends on two things whether management can gain the trust of the workers and whether union leaders can control the rank and file 
47mc030l It doesn\'t look good on either count 
47mc030m [tongue_click] Indeed labor experts say there is only a slim chance that South Korea can lay a foundation for labor relations that might calm worker unrest soon 
47mc030n Turnout is another unknown factor 
47mc030o To capitalize here Governor Dukakis would like to see a heavy turnout especially in such pockets of strength as the Chicago lakefront and suburbs

47nc020u [tongue_click] They\'ve been calling on us for about fifteen years and didn\'t generate any business for the first ten he says 
47nc020v Their persistence and the wealth of Japan and the flows of capital from Japan have paid off for them 
47nc020w People thought we\'d sit back and just enjoy the holidays [loud_breath] said Edward P\. Nicoski market strategist at Piper Jaffray and Hopwood Inc\. Minneapolis 
47nc020x But we\'re seeing some strong buying here 
47nc020y We\'re seeing a whole bunch of stocks breaking out of their trading ranges 
47nc020z [tongue_click] The Soviets obviously want to make it as difficult as possible for NATO to carry out its modernization said one Western diplomat in Bonn 
47nc0210 A senior NATO diplomat accused the Soviets of trying to seduce the Germans away from us 
47nc0211 It is none too subtle wedge driving he told Reuters 
47nc0212 But at another operation in rural northern *Illinois* there are hardly any minorities to draw from 
47nc0213 We picked that location because we needed the river access there to be successful Mr\. Thompson says 
47nc0214 ~ -I know I have a social responsibility 
47nc0215 But I also have a responsibility to my shareholders 
47nc0216 Champion said about two thousand one hundred workers struck its five lumber and plywood plants in the region over the weekend 
47nc0217 Stamford Conn\. based Champion has fourteen such plants nationwide the spokesman said 
47nc0218 The International Woodworkers of America and the Western Council of Industrial Workers union struck two Champion mills where the contract recently expired according to a Champion spokesman 
47nc0219 Picket lines erected by those strikers quickly closed the others where contracts either have expired or will expire by July thirty first he added 
47nc021a [tongue_click] Tobacco heiress Doris Duke agreed to post five million dollars needed by Imelda Marcos to secure bail on racketeering charges 
47nc021b Duke is the daughter of the former president of American Tobacco Company Marcos and her husband [loud_breath] the deposed president of the Philippines [loud_breath] are accused of looting [loud_breath] Manila\'s treasury 
47nc021c His arraignment has been delayed 
47nc021d Mr\. Jordan was awarded damages of nearly eight thousand dollars and a punitive award of four hundred thousand dollars 
47nc021e The jury also found that Clayton under Missouri common law had breached its fiduciary duties because of self dealing 
47nc021f The appeals court upheld the lower court in October nineteen eighty eight 
47nc0301 The statute allows for a great deal of latitude agrees Arthur Christy the first special prosecutor appointed under the nineteen seventy eight law 
47nc0302 In past investigation he notes the focus has been quite narrow 
47nc0303 But in each case he suggests It\'s up to the counsel he certainly has the powers 
47nc0304 Also the strong rise in share prices in recent weeks appears to have discounted most of the good news likely in the budget another dealer said 
47nc0305 It\'s going to take quite a lot to move it sharply ahead from this level he said 
47nc0306 The hundred share index is up eighteen \.POINT six \%PERCENT this year 
47nc0307 Some tire executives such as John J\. Nevin chief executive officer of Firestone Tire and i- Rubber Company say Mr\. Stone understands the industry\'s problems 
47nc0308 But Mr\. Stone\'s union critics aren\'t so generous 
47nc0309 They say he has been lax about organizing new members for example 
47nc030a Under the agreement subject to regulatory approval Ypsilanti shareholders would receive one \.POINT nine three five shares of Trustcorp common for each common share of Ypsilanti 
47nc030b Trustcorp said it plans to complete the purchase in the fourth quarter 
47nc030c Ypsilanti Savings Bank has about one thirty eight million dollars in assets 
47nc030d Trustcorp income is a holding company with assets of f- four \.POINT six billion dollars 
47nc030e Critics of indexing charge that the approach lacks imagination and amounts to settling for mediocrity 
47nc030f Advocates reply that indexing means lower management fees than those of actively managed bond funds 
47nc030g [tongue_click] Also indexing in recent years often has produced significantly better results [loud_breath] than many active managers 
47nc030h But John Smale P\. and G\'s chairman and chief executive used the meeting to speak at length about hostile takeovers in general 
47nc030i He maintained that too often they leave companies loaded with debt and shrunken research budgets and ignore the interests of employees and the communities in which the companies do business 
47nc030j [tongue_click] He also argued that over the long run hostile takeovers don\'t necessarily provide a good mechanism for shareholders to realize full value for their shares 
47nc030k A French press report said the exports include sophisticated equipment for making semiconductors 
47nc030l It said the machinery may have helped the Soviets build advanced computer memories for such military purposes as missile guidance 
47nc030m Western nations have reached agreements intended to forbid exports of such equipment to the Soviets 
47nc030n When stocks are rising portfolio insurers don\'t hedge and instead ride the market higher 
47nc030o When stocks are falling portfolio insurers sell stock index futures in effect cushioning the values of their stock portfolios from the full brunt of a dropping market 
47nc030p The idea according to Wall Street proponents is to provide protection at a low cost 
47nc030q As a manager Mr\. O\'Malley concedes he pushes subordinates to work long and hard hours if necessary 
47nc030r But as a boss I pick my spots to be tough he adds 
47nc030s I also like to let professionals show how good they can be on their own 
47nc030t December delivery gold settled at four eighty two \.POINT seven zero dollars for a decline of twelve \.POINT eight zero dollars

47nc030w Yesterday people close to Federated\'s board said that the company was still open to yet another friendly merger proposal from Campeau 
47nc030x If they\'ve got something to show us we\'ll take a look at it 
47nc030y They know where to find us said one source 
47nc030z We\'re not stonewalling them 
47nc0310 Car sales apparently have leveled off after disappointing results early in the year followed by a sharp uptick in late January 
47nc0311 Bigger incentives fueled the rebound and have helped sustain the sales pace 
47nc0312 Chrysler Corporation for example boosted cash rebates to two thousand five hundred dollars on some models 
47nc0313 [tongue_click] Given the nature of our ownership it\'s obviously a very complex issue Mr\. Elish said 
47nc0314 There are a lot of things to consider and we\'re looking at it 
47nc0315 But nothing is imminent 
47nc0316 It does not however seem reasonable to the Germans who are instead mulling a tax increase to shore up a leaky government budget 
47nc0317 As for the U\. S\. comments on German inflation a typical German might respond Zero inflation 
47nc0318 What\'s wrong with that 
47nc0319 Generally there\'s no limit on how much of their funds employees can borrow if their accounts total ten thousand dollars or less 
47nc031a For larger accounts employees are restricted to borrowing half the total but no more than fifty thousand dollars 
47nc031b Loans must be repaid within five years unless the money goes toward buying a principal residence in which case longer repayment terms can be arranged 
47nc031c Borrowed funds aren\'t taxed 
47nc031d But a withdrawal is treated as taxable income and is subject to an additional ten \%PERCENT penalty tax 
47nc0401 Like Drexel Mr\. Icahn has been subpoenaed in connection with the government\'s continuing investigation of the Boesky scandal 
47nc0402 A *subpoena* is a request for information and doesn\'t imply any wrongdoing 
47nc0403 Mr\. Icahn\'s lawyers at Weil Gotschal and Manges in New York said the investigation had absolutely no connection with the withdrawal of Mr\. Icahn\'s bid 
47nc0404 But Mr\. Gibbs is hopeful that many taxpayers will accept 
47nc0405 Among other incentives the new tax law phases out the deductibility of interest payments to the I\. R\. S\. 
47nc0406 [tongue_click] The I\. R\. S\. ha- also has been successful in Tax Court challenges to people involved in tax shelters 
47nc0407 We\'re winning more than we\'re losing the I\. R\. S\. chief points out 
47nc0408 Doubleday also provided Bertelsmann with much needed U\. S\. book manufacturing operations [tongue_click] 
47nc0409 Moreover Mr\. Vitale says it\'s worth a premium to get a foothold in the U\. S\. market 
47nc040a If you are in publishing the only market with large numbers is the English speaking market he says 
47nc040b Many people however claim that irresponsible owners not the dogs themselves are to blame for the high incidence of attacks 
47nc040c They\'re amoral says an official of the United Kennel Club a prestigious pedigree association 
47nc040d They\'ll do what the trainer allows them to do 
47nc040e K\. mart and Bruno\'s said their hypermarkets which haven\'t been named yet will include specialty shops 
47nc040f The facilities will cover about two twenty five thousand square feet or three times the space of the average K\. mart discount department store 
47nc040g [tongue_click] Located in major metropolitan areas they will be totally distinct from the current operations of both companies a prepared statement said 
47nc040h The first is expected to open next year 
47nc040i What\'s more a further drop in the dollar could have the very result Mr\. Baker seeks to avoid higher interest rates 
47nc040j In order to keep persuading foreign investors to hold cheaper dollars the Federal Reserve must keep U\. S\. interest rates higher than those abroad 
47nc040k An even weaker dollar could require higher rates 
47nc040l Under terms of the original agreement Computer Memories would have issued new shares of its own in exchange for shares of closely held Hemdale 
47nc040m Current Hemdale holders then would have owned about seventy eight \%PERCENT of Computer Memories\' shares 
47nc040n The surviving company would have been named Hemdale Film Corporation and John Daly Hemdale\'s current chairman would have become chief executive officer of the surviving company 
47nc040o A spokesman f:or Cray described the M\. I\. T\. decision as good news 
47nc040p Assuming the bidding does open up again it means there\'s room for technical considerations and not considerations based purely on price 
47nc040q The spokesman said it would have been impossible for Cray to install and operate a complete supercomputer system [loud_breath] at the prices M\. I\. T\. wanted to pay 
47nc040r With technology like this the company that invented the overnight express business fourteen years ago still dominates it 
47nc040s Federal Express collects more than half the revenue in what is now more than a six billion industry 
47nc040t And at a time when deteriorating service is a national malady this company claims to deliver more than ninety nine \%PERCENT of its letters and packages on time 
47nc040u Housing starts totaled one [unintelligible] six seventy four thousand three hundred units last year by twenty two \.POINT seven \%PERCENT from nineteen eighty six 
47nc040v In December alone starts rose twenty \.POINT eight \%PERCENT to one fifty five thousand five eighty nine units 
47nc040w That marked the twentieth consecutive monthly increase 
47nc040x Early February North American built car sales edged up zero \.POINT three \%PERCENT according to figures reported last week 
47nc040y That translates into a seasonally adjusted annual rate of eight \.POINT one million vehicles compared with a seven \.POINT seven million rate a year earlier 
47nc040z This week\'s mid February report on car sales will tell whether that pace was being maintained 
47nc0410 Of course to a great extent the stock prices of the various companies that will be reporting higher earnings already [loud_breath] reflect shareholder expectations 
47nc0411 That obviously will mute the price movement of any particular stock when the company reports its earnings unless analysts\' estimates are seriously out of kilter 
47nc0412 As portfolio strategists puzzle over the market impact of this wave of good news they come up with some sharply divergent opinions 
47nc0413 After lar(ry)- Larry Speakes lost his job with Merrill Lynch I was a little reluctant to join the posse of critics 
47nc0414 You hate to kick a guy when he\'s down 
47nc0415 But something made me change my mind 
47nc0416 I read his book 
47nc0417 Monarch Capital rose two to four one three by four 
47nc0418 The company which is in the process of buying one million of its common shares said it will purchase another one million shares 
47nc0419 Monarch has about seven \.POINT two million shares outstanding 
47nc041a Overall consumer spending has slowed since last year\'s stock market crash but it\'s still at a level that worries some economists 
47nc041b [tongue_click] Consumer credit slowed sharply in July reflecting sluggish sales 
47nc041c Too much spending at home coupled with heavy demand for exports could overload an industrial sector that is already running near capacity 
47nc041d The front page of the third section displays the day\'s top news from equity credit and other markets in the U\. S\. and abroad

47oc0201 The International Security and Development Cooperation Act of nineteen eighty five [loud_breath] directed the president to appoint a task force [loud_breath] on Project Economic Justice [loud_breath] for Central America and the Caribbean 
47oc0202 Congress charged the group with developing a plan for the expanded use of employee stock ownership plans as a mean of broadening the capital ownership base there 
47oc0203 Mr\. Reagan named senior diplomat and financier J\. William Middendorf the second the former U\. S\. Ambassador to the Organization of American States as chairman [lip_smack] 
47oc0204 The system isn\'t one hundred \%PERCENT perfect [loud_breath] but it\'s working reasonably well a Foreign Ministry official told reporters 
47oc0205 The official said the U\. S\. has been similarly reassured 
47oc0206 Even so the U\. S\. has indicated that it wants Japan to take better care of how Japanese technology is sold around the world 
47oc0207 [tongue_click] Last month auto sales fell one \.POINT four \%PERCENT after rising five \.POINT seven \%PERCENT in August 
47oc0208 Sales of building materials increased one \.POINT two \%PERCENT after a zero \.POINT four \%PERCENT drop 
47oc0209 Overall sales of durable goods which are indicated to last three years or more fell zero \.POINT nine \%PERCENT after rising three \.POINT one \%PERCENT in August

47oc020b L\. F\. Rothschild Holdings rose one and three fourths to eight and three eighths 
47oc020c The firm\'s co chief executive said it is meeting all of its capital requirements 
47oc020d Salomon Incorporated rose three to twenty five . E\. F\. Hutton gained one and seven eighths to eighteen . and five eighths . PaineWebber added one to eighteen and one fourth 
47oc020e The bill if it becomes law would bar hostile acquirers [loud_breath] from merging with their targets from three years after an offer is launched except under certain conditions 
47oc020f [tongue_click] The Delaware House of Representa:tives unanimously passed the legislation Tuesday 
47oc020g [misc_noise] [footsteps/] The Senate is expected to approve it today [/footsteps] 
47oc020h [footsteps/] One of the best known international [/footsteps] stock pickers John Templeton nearly equaled the index without any Japanese stocks in his small Templeton Foreign fund 
47oc020i He did so via winning bets in such markets as Mexico Canada and Britain 
47oc020j We were very fortunate he said 
47oc020k His larger funds which can include U\. S\. stocks didn\'t fare as well 
47oc020l Turnout is another unknown factor 
47oc020m To capitalize here Governor Dukakis would like to see a heavy turnout especially in such pockets of strength as the Chicago lakefront and suburbs 
47oc020n But that may not happen Illinois registration is below nineteen eighty four and no presidential candidate has yet caught fire 
47oc020o The networks have begun the delicate craft of spinning the numbers [loud_breath] to their benefit and of putting the best shine on a dismal television season 
47oc020p C\. B\. S\. held a news briefing last Friday 
47oc020q A\. B\. C\. hosts one today . N\. B\. C\. will do so tomorrow 
47oc020r Some rules governing the ability to stay in business take effect Friday 
47oc020s But Professor Pennington says it will be twelve months before businesses begin to lose their authorization [lip_smack] 
47oc020t Regulators he says can\'t be too hard on people who justifiably claim they haven\'t had time to comply 
47oc020u Anyone who accepts the job of investigating the Speaker should be prepared to take some heat 
47oc020v [tongue_click] Last week Common Cause called for an investigation of Mr\. Wright\'s finances 
47oc020w The Speaker retaliated in a public statement and his minions in the leadership said the group was dead on Capitol Hill 
47oc020x The whole environment has changed he says 
47oc020y We have a lot more options than we did before 
47oc020z He\'s planning on spending seven million on advertising and promotion this year compared with a couple of million dollars in the past 
47oc0210 Condom sales for the entire industry were up twenty seven \%PERCENT for the last twelve months ended in April 
47oc0211 Carter Wallace\'s share amounts to over fifty \%PERCENT of the total market 
47oc0212 [tongue_click] Mr\. Chatichai\'s wealthy family background and his family\'s large property interests give him a good understanding of the business community 
47oc0213 Further he has good relations with the large ethnic Chinese community and serves as a chairman [loud_breath] of the Thai Chinese Friendship Association 
47oc0214 That\'s important for the country\'s business elite many of whom are ethnic Chinese 
47oc0215 As a result the Sequoia won\'t be going back to the U\. S\. Navy this year [loud_breath] 
47oc0216 Or perhaps any year 
47oc0217 And the ship which was used by eight U\. S\. presidents might even go under [misc_noise] 
47oc0218 The Treasury is scheduled to announce details of its quarterly financing operation November second 
47oc0219 It usually consists of three year notes ten year notes and thirty year bonds 
47oc021a But the department is very close to reaching its limits on issuing long term debt [loud_breath] and thus has asked Congress to increase its authority 
47oc021b Congress still hasn\'t completed work on the issue which is part of the tax bill passed late Tuesday by the Senate 
47oc021c In recent months Spicer has cut its one thousand member U\. S\. staff by ten \%PERCENT in an effort to cut costs 
47oc021d Mr\. Bernstein said that a merger of the two firms world wide would create an international organization [loud_breath] with one billion in annual revenue 
47oc021e We believe Spicer is a very good niche firm [loud_breath] but our merger discussions are very early at this point he said 
47oc0301 In addition to the war of nerves over discounts retail executives said that Christmas season has been characterized by the absence of a big hit [loud_breath] in the toy department 
47oc0302 But retailers have seen strong sales of big ticket items to well heeled customers 
47oc0303 [tongue_click] They are buying to beat the new tax law which will end the deduction of sale taxes and some interest expenses 
47oc0304 It\'s about as interesting as yesterday\'s tuna fish said Maryann Keller an auto analyst with Furman Selz Mager Dietz and Birney 
47oc0305 The Japanese are going to have a heck of a time selling two \.POINT three million cars in nineteen eighty seven 
47oc0306 I\'m not sure holding quotas does them any harm [tongue_click] 
47oc0307 [tongue_click] Ms\. Bass won\'t discuss strategy for I\. Magnin 
47oc0308 But industry observers say I\. Magnin like other s- retailers in today\'s saturated markets [loud_breath] will have to establish a more focused identity 
47oc0309 Ms\. Bass also will have to reassess the value of some of its scattered stores including those in Chicago Washington and Arizona and increase sales volume 
47oc030a That\'s the only cure says Mark Shulman president of Limited Incorporated . Henri Bendel and a former executive at I\. Magnin and Bloomingdale\'s 
47oc030b While all West German political parties agreed on the need for tax cuts of about twenty two billion they differ on who should benefit 
47oc030c [door_slam] The Social Democrats and the left wing Greens want the cuts to help the poor and the working class 
47oc030d [tongue_click] Within the ruling coalition the liberal Free Democrats and the Bavarian sister party of the Christian Democrats the Christian Socialists want cuts spread across the board 
47oc030e His answer [loud_breath] Raise the temperature artificially in the morning by jogging or with a hot drink 
47oc030f Breakfast also helps as does jumping into a hot shower on awakening 
47oc030g At the opposite end Morning people take naps 
47oc030h A fifteen to twenty minute nap at two or three p\. m\. will give them more energy 
47oc030i Mr\. Walsh\'s legal theory . about the flow of funds is likely to be the linchpin of an effort to bring broader conspiracy and other criminal charges 
47oc030j Central targets of the investigation include former National Security Adviser John Poindexter former White House aide Oliver North and retired Air Force Major General Richard Secord 
47oc030k A final decision on seeking charges could come in September 
47oc030l In the two selected areas the state will allow [loud_breath] procurement and retail prices to rise to what the open market demands 
47oc030m The subsidy of consumers is meant to reduce the strain on urban residents 
47oc030n Farmers of course will get higher prices for their grain from the market [loud_breath] which in turn should induce them to increase production 
47oc030o Grain production throughout China has f:altered in recent years in part because state procurement prices were too low 
47oc030p Remember the one about the investment banker 
47oc030q It was widely told circa October nineteenth nineteen eighty seven [loud_breath] and went like this What do you call an investment banker

47oc030s Hardliners for instance want a law that bans all obscene and indecent speech over the telephone 
47oc030t [tongue_click] The battle should be carried to the Supreme Court argues Representative William Dannemeyer a California Republican 
47oc030u Dial a porn he says moves sexuality from the human level to the animal level 
47oc030v [loud_breath] These are very interesting times said Richard Shaffer an industry consultant and analyst who publishes . Technologic Computer Letter 
47oc030w A year ago it seemed that I\. B\. M\. and Microsoft alone [loud_breath] would dictate the standards for desktop computers in the office 
47oc030x Now after Apple\'s lawsuit challenging Microsoft and Sun coming up with Open Look for Unix we have the possibility of seeking three very competitive standards 
47oc030y The government\'s official armed forces magazines traditionally have been off limits to all advertisers 
47oc030z But recently the Army and Navy started considering farming theirs out to commercial publishers who would accept ads 
47oc0310 We\'re exploring to see how much money we could save on our Soldiers magazine an Army spokesman says 
47oc0311 All this reflects a mood of transition and uncertainty that has gripped Britain\'s [other_mouth_sound] publicly subsidized theater in recent years 
47oc0312 Fretting about finances most companies are taking fewer creative risks 
47oc0313 Audiences in turn have grown more conservative 
47oc0314 Yet there\'s more work performed now than in years mainly to keep revenues flowing 
47oc0315 The Tigers don\'t like to stress the source of their baseball prowess 
47oc0316 The team\'s press releases say the team has English born and bred players 
47oc0317 Under questioning in the stadium pub Mr\. Hunt admits to having recruited a Dutchman a Pakistanian and an American third baseman 
47oc0318 The suggested retail price for Cinderella is twenty six dollars and ninety nine cents and for E\. T\. twenty four dollars and ninety five cents 
47oc0319 [loud_breath] But both have been heavily discounted by much as nine dollar a cassette and both have rebate offers 
47oc031a The home video industry is hoping [loud_breath] the massive purchases of both cassettes will turn many cassette renters into at least occasional buyers in the future 
47oc031b There are still legislative issues to be resolved on the Senate floor [loud_breath] and among the four House committees before the bill reaches the House floor 
47oc031c Business groups for example are unhappy at provisions requiring bus companies to install wheelchair lifts and handicapped toilets in new over the road buses 
47oc031d [tongue_click] The groups also criticize the lack of a blanket small business [loud_breath] exemption for public accommodations 
47oc031e [door_slam] But many other businesses objections have already been dealt with in the White House Senate negotiations pretty much eliminating the chances that the measures could yet be derailed 
47oc0401 Now he sells knockoff Gucci and Rolex watches starting at fifty dollars apiece to the secretaries at his prep school 
47oc0402 My strategy is to get them alone he explains 
47oc0403 Then later they can show off their watches and brag about their generous husbands 
47oc0404 Robert E\. Wunderle vice president of public affairs for Supermarkets General says the company has held discussions in good faith with the Hafts 
47oc0405 He added that the company is disappointed that the Hafts . have chosen to publicize the contents of a letter filled with half truths and distortions 
47oc0406 He declined to elaborate 
47oc0407 Mr\. Junger previously has denied any wrongdoing [loud_breath] and has said he isn\'t responsible for the currency loss 
47oc0408 He was summarily dismissed by the company when the currency loss came to light ending his severance contract [loud_breath] that was to run until September 
47oc0409 He resigned from V\. W\. in January over differences on how the auto maker\'s foreign exchange department should be run 
47oc040a The world is made up of optimists and *pessimists* says Mr\. Stone 
47oc040b In this industry in this state they\'re mostly *pessimists* 
47oc040c I may be the last optimist but I\'m sure I\'m right 
47oc040d Quebec Energy Minister John Ciaccia said the provi:dential owned utility plans to appeal the ruling to the Federal Court of Canada 
47oc040e New England utility and energy officials said the decision isn\'t a cause for serious concern yet because of the appeal 
47oc040f [misc_noise] They added that there\'s still time for New England utilities to seek alternative energy sources 
47oc040g The window of opportunity for the creation of superregional bank might not be open long 
47oc040h Then we will face the challenge of [loud_breath] con:solidating our positions 
47oc040i It\'s going to be tough [cross_talk] 
47oc040j What has distinguished us is that our returns on assets . and equity are far above average 
47oc040k Maintaining those levels that\'s going to be the challenge

47oc040o Ford\'s fourth quarter sales were eighteen \.POINT eight billion up fifteen \%PERCENT from sixteen \.POINT three billion a year l- earlier 
47oc040p Full year sales rose fourteen \%PERCENT [loud_breath] to seventy one \.POINT six billion from sixty two \.POINT seven billion [door_slam] 
47oc040q That large jump enabled Ford to increase its share of the U\. S\. new car market to twenty \.POINT two \%PERCENT from eighteen \.POINT two \%PERCENT 
47oc040r After his orientation Mr\. Boesky will be assigned a regular job 
47oc040s Though he can state a preference Mr\. Sams said [loud_breath] Mr\. Boesky will go where the prison needs him 
47oc040t He noted that many of the most desirable jobs are snapped up by inmates with more seniority 
47oc040u The desirable jobs Mr\. Sams said are at the prison\'s factory which makes wooden furniture for federal offices [loud_breath] the dairy farm and the slaughterhouse 
47oc040v Meanwhile Audi set up a bonus plan to encourage dealership salespeople to sell Audi eighty and ninety cars newer models that carry far less generous incentives 
47oc040w Under the bonus plan Audi promised to give sales people two hundred and fifty dollars every time they sold an eighty or ninety model 
47oc040x Law officials from the Federal Trade Commission and several states have said they are opening inquiries into Audi\'s rebates 
47oc040y More states are considering such legislation which is being promoted by Irish American politicians and pressure groups and which Sinn Fein supports 
47oc040z We expect to face challenges in quite a number of states says Simon Johnston of the providence Department of Economic Development 
47oc0410 We could have had more American funds and we have not got them and Macbride is part of the reason the department\'s Gerry Lavery says 
47oc0411 Mr\. Leppo was chief merchandising officer and executive vice president at a- Allied from August nineteen eighty seven until last July 
47oc0412 He and Ms\. Fortune said Mr\. Campeau encouraged them to bid for Ann Taylor 
47oc0413 Ms\. Fortune had been president and chief executive officer of Ann Taylor for the past one and one half years 
47oc0414 But the lawmakers actually spent only about f:ive hundred million of the money authorized under the legislation this fiscal year 
47oc0415 And so far hardly any of the promised additional two \.POINT three billion has been forthcoming 
47oc0416 We lost our bill concedes Senator Moynihan a New York Democrat 
47oc0417 The inescapable fact however [loud_breath] is that one day the water is going to run out or become too expensive to pump up 
47oc0418 We\'re going to see less production [door_slam] 
47oc0419 There\'s no way around it says Kansas State extension economist Mark Nelson 
47oc041a But it\'s not going to be a cata- -lysmic thing 
47oc041b People close to the situation say the company and pilots\' union were hoping to hammer out an agreement that the other labor groups would f:ind acceptable 
47oc041c But Mr\. Schroeder\'s letter said [loud_breath] the mechanics will neither accept a fait . accompli: nor be stamped into unnecessary or imprudent action 
47oc041d [tongue_click] He also said the mechanics\' union will oppose any transaction that doesn\'t guarantee job protection for its members 
47oc041e The Treasury market got off to a weak start overnight in Tokyo where limited selling among Japanese investors pushed prices as much as one fourth point lower 
47oc041f When the market opened in the U\. S\. prices remained lower throughout the day 
47oc041g Even a stronger dollar and lower commodity prices failed to inspire confidence in the bond market 
47pc0201 States are getting serious about welfare reform because they can no longer afford to subsidize a percentage of their residents in . perpet:uity 
47pc0202 A growing body of evidence suggests that increased welfare spending will not make a dent in poverty 
47pc0203 [tongue_click] To the contrary the spending may actually have consequences such as family dissolution . illegim- . illegitimate births and chronic unemployment 
47pc0204 More enlightened welfare policy must abate not . exa(cerbate)- -(exa)cerbate these problems 
47pc0205 A miscalculation prompted California to move first 
47pc0206 Legislatures . worried that Proposition thirteen tax restraints would force big layoffs in government workers . hurriedly passed a short time compensation law in July nineteen seventy eight 
47pc0207 Those layoffs never came . budget surpluses permitted state and local governments to retain staffs 
47pc0208 But some private employers [loud_breath] saw in the law an answer to their own needs 
47pc0209 The F\. L\. I\. C\. fund is supposed to cover insured deposits of eight hundred and ninety billion dollars in the nation\'s three thousand federally insured thrifts 
47pc020a Even the Bank Board\'s stated one \.POINT nine billion dollars of reserves is the lowest ratio of reserves to deposits ever 
47pc020b [beep] Also pending are requests for more than two billion dollars in loans to troubled thrifts 
47pc020c Already Mr\. Gorbachev has instituted quality controls at industrial enterprises 
47pc020d Since January first a newly created agency has been s- sending inspectors to factories with the authority to declare goods too shoddy for sale to the public 
47pc020e Managers at the plants must make up any resulting losses by slashing bonuses 
47pc020f Ms\. Oates doesn\'t say much about personal power . about being able to stand up to others 
47pc020g But the feeling of power and confidence is what we lady boxers . agree w- we liked most about our new skill 
47pc020h It\'s also why we advocate boxing for all [loud_breath] especially little girls who are still raised to believe they don\'t have a fighting chance in a man\'s world

47pc020o The Bartelos lost out in the bidding for Allied to Campeau Corporation a Toro(nto)- -(To)ronto real estate firm 
47pc020p [loud_breath] Carter Hawley avoided a takeover through a restructuring 
47pc020q If its maverick strategy works Security Pacific will be showing another way besides acquisitions . for superregional banks to grow 
47pc020r These banks\' managers including Mr\. Flamson plan to eventually challenge the big New York banks as national giants in their own right

47pc0211 On a per ton basis pretax profit doubled to about thirty six dollars from eighteen dollars in the third quarter 
47pc0212 However [loud_breath] the performance fell far short of U\. S\. X\. Chairman David Roderick\'s prediction of a fifty dollar plus per . ton profit 
47pc0213 However net losses in Eurodollar bond prices were estimated at only one eighth to three eighth point by traders 
47pc0214 The benchmark Canadian n- nine \%PERCENT bonds due in nineteen ninety six were bid thirty basis points lower

47pc0303 With the facility Plessey hopes to triple its annual semiconductor sales to about five hundred million dollars by nineteen ninety 
47pc0304 Burlington also has been moving aggressively in court to counter the hostile bid

47pc0306 The Pac Man defense is named after the video game in which the player tries to gobble up his foe before the player is swallowed 
47pc0307 These criticisms are overwrought and unconvincing 
47pc0308 [loud_breath] While private operators will certainly lobby in their own interest [loud_breath] it does not follow that they could manipulate public opinion and lawmakers as easily as their opponents suggest 
47pc0309 Nor is it clear that private prison operators would have to lobby for harsher sentences 
47pc030a Given current levels of overcrowding [lip_smack] [loud_breath] and public sentiment in favor of stricter sentencing [lip_smack] [loud_breath] there will be no shortage of inmates to fill new facilities 
47pc030b Here are price trends on the world\'s major stock markets as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective Geneva

47pc030k Professional corporations 
47pc030l Taxes would go up for corporations consisting of lawyers doctors accountants and architects 
47pc030m The provision would eliminate graduated rates for these professional service corporations . so that they all would pay a- the flat thirty four \%PERCENT corporate rate 
47pc030n Why should foreign imports be a better measure of U\. S\. exports 
47pc030o And why are the export data so bad 
47pc030p Import data are directly collected by a single government agency they provide revenue from tariffs and they provide politically important measures of goods subject to quotas 
47pc030q These aspects of import accounting encourage government agents to amass accurate import data 
47pc030r Conversely for exports self interest induces underreporting 
47pc030s There is no shortage of examples 
47pc030t Growing life expectancy threatens to bankrupt Social Security [lip_smack] [loud_breath] but the compromise of nineteen eighty three did little more than burden workers by raising the payroll tax

47pc030z One million families fall into poverty each year because of the devastating costs of long term illness 
47pc0310 The private sector cannot solve the problem 
47pc0311 We need a social insurance program that will protect people from a- all ages against the financial burdens of long term illness 
47pc0312 The additional shares may be bought in the open market or private transactions the filing said 
47pc0313 Pennant added however that its intention to raise the stake is subject to change 
47pc0314 A Bay spokesman declined comment on the filing 
47pc0315 The E\. P\. A\. proposed minimum standards for municipal trash dumps [loud_breath] that the agency estimated will cost . eight hundred and eighty seven million dollars a year 
47pc0316 The proposed rules require about six thousand dumps to install groundwater monitoring systems 
47pc0317 They would also close some dumps and put special conditions on others in certain areas 
47pc0318 The industrialized countries at Berlin will continue to stress tackling the debt problem on a case by case basis 
47pc0319 Economic assistance from bodies such as the I\. M\. F\. will remain conditional on economic changes in the debtor countries 
47pc031a Debt forgiveness except for the poorest countries in Africa will remain a matter of discreet negotiation 
47pc031b Quite possibly a recent profit sharing bonus helped 
47pc031c We don\'t have an elegant formula says Mr\. Barron 
47pc031d We said we think everyone\'s entitled to a share so here\'s a check 
47pc031e Next year if we do well there may be a bigger check 
47pc031f Is this any way to run a railroad

47pc0401 Finally failure has a social value . if an . ignoble one

47pc0407 He is credited with drilling the presidents of Trust Company\'s eighteen Georgia banks on those fundamentals setting ambitious profit targets and holding the banks strictly accountable for reaching them 
47pc0408 Now Sun\'s twenty six Florida banks get the same treatment from Mr\. Williams 
47pc0409 There\'s a lot of autonomy but you\'ve got to earn it says Thomas S\. Clark the marketing director at Sun\'s Polk County bank

47pc040j The long distance phone industry and its customers are in a battle over billing for unconnected phone calls 
47pc040k The issue has produced a spate of lawsuits claims that individuals and businesses have t- [loud_breath] been taken for millions of dollars [loud_breath] and cries of coverup by some irate customers 
47pc040l California regulators are so concerned that they are considering barring many long distance companies from billing for perhaps a quarter of their traffic 
47pc040m It has been shown repeatedly that the public supports the basic idea of defending the U\. S\. from incoming ballistic missiles 
47pc040n If Mr\. Reagan wants S\. D\. I\. to be a lasting legacy of his administration [loud_breath] it will be necessary to start building on the support that already exists 
47pc040o That task will be made easier if the administration provides the developing evidence of the Soviet threat 
47pc040p Nor is the new chain\'s ethnic motif meant to imply . culinary adventure

47qc0207 In both the Hungarian and Suez crises the United States proceeded in accord with the rule [loud_breath] of avoiding direct confrontation with the Soviet Union 
47qc0208 In the Hungarian affair this meant doing nothing except talking because taking any practical step would at once have meant a confrontation

47qc0215 [other_mouth_sound] It\'s my sense that there was a time when people thought they could trade on inside information with absolute impunity 
47qc0216 And that\'s no longer true 
47qc0217 Now I am certain that there are still people who think they can trade on inside information and get away with it [loud_breath] because they\'re smarter than the average person

47qc030b [other_mouth_sound] The only requirement is that you have to be an adult to receive the magazine says Mary Taylor associate publisher 
47qc030c That\'s not because of racy articles but because the tobacco industry has been accused of trying to snatch twelve and thirteen year olds 
47qc030d [tongue_click] Philip Morris is even considering selling space to outside advertisers it already ran an ad for Time magazine on a test basis in its winter nineteen eighty seven issue 
47qc030e General Ramos also confirmed for the first time that Philippine authorities were looking into possible foreign involvement in the coup attempt the Associated Press reported

47qc0313 The president could decline to move against certain countries if doing so would be against the national economic interest though 
47qc0314 Congress wants speedy action because time often can be critical in winning protection for certain intellectual property [loud_breath] such as computer software which can be copied rapidly

47qc031b Mr\. Martens said Vitro wasn\'t prepared to agree to that condition 
47qc031c He said Apparently Anchor is concerned that the information it is offering to provide will give Vitro a basis for lowering the price 
47qc031d Indeed the actions taken by Anchor give Vitro a basis to lower the bid

47qc0404 PaineWebber itself hasn\'t been charged with wrongdoing 
47qc0405 The firm a unit of PaineWebber Group Incorporated released a short statement yesterday in which it said the two men have been suspended indefinitely 
47qc0406 [tongue_click] [loud_breath] The firm has cooperated with the U\. S\. Attorney\'s office throughout the investigation and will continue to do so 
47qc0407 [tongue_click] Meanwhile the agency said it will conduct a study on its own 
47qc0408 Officials said the review may lead to new regulations for data processing systems 
47qc0409 The agency may also challenge past charges to the Pentagon 
47qc040a [loud_breath] Pentagon officials say the review likely will take at least a year 
47qc040b It\'s the life of an entrepreneur and the fate of creativity in a modern financially oriented America Mr\. Lucas says warming to the subject 
47qc040c It\'s about what happens to a society when it grows old and tries to keep the status quo [loud_breath] instead of letting its more creative instincts take over 
47qc040d Although Tucker is set in the nineteen forties Mr\. Lucas makes it clear he thinks the film\'s subject is current and quite personal 
47qc040e [loud_breath] Bullion dealers say the five houses fixing the gold price have to respond to the needs of the market and requirements of British financial legislation 
47qc040f As a group the five bullion firms transact less business than outside market makers several London bullion traders say 
47qc040g Unlike gold futures markets in New York and Chicago however the London gold market doesn\'t publish trading statistics 
47qc040h Saboteurs are our biggest problem says Mr\. Cairo referring to the bevy of people who shield the debtor 
47qc040i At the office the collector\'s natural enemies are switchboard operators and secretaries so Mr\. Cairo advises calling the debtor before nine after five and during lunch 
47qc040j At that time the prey himself may answer 
47qc040k The opposition is already rolling 
47qc040l Many of the pressure groups that campaigned unsuccessfully against Mr\. Reagan in two presidential campaigns seem to regard this battle as their Armageddon 
47qc040m Teddy Kennedy himself has testified that Judge Bork\'s appearance means the end is near 
47qc040n If Ronald Reagan wants Robert Bork confirmed he will have to create an alternative choice to the one these groups are trying to force on undecided senators 
47qc040o That means Mr\. Reagan has to explain clearly why American society will benefit if judges such as Robert Bork apply the law in a neutral manner 
47qc040p [other_mouth_sound] He will have to point out why [<misc_noise] many of the long held grievances of the electorate result [loud_breath] when unelected judges manufacture new laws 
47qc040q Mr\. . Antoniu\'s fall and surprising rebound prove there is life after insider trading 
47qc040r [tongue_click] But his story also suggests that some character traits that may give rise to insider trading [loud_breath] can be hard to change 
47qc040s Insider trading is a form of fraud and some Sport About franchisees now claim they have been defrauded by Mr\. Antoniu 
47qc040t Pet owners often call a pet psychic because a pet is sick and they want a detailed account of how it\'s feeling 
47qc040u And some pet psychics claim they can chat with pets from a distance 
47qc040v For example Gay Travers a former publicist called pet psychic Penelope Smith when her cat Sebastian was very ill 
47qc040w Ms\. Smith told her to hang up while the psychic talked to Sebastian 
47qc040x Three minutes later she called back with some bad news 
47qc040y Lost wages some economists are dismayed at the Labor Department\'s plans to drop the hourly earnings index from its monthly employment report next year 
47qc040z [tongue_click] It\'s a fashionable number said Mr\. Chandross of Lloyd\'s Bank New York 
47qc0410 Economists are currently focusing on the index to get a reading on wage inflation 
47qc0411 [other_mouth_sound] The Labor Department will continue to report monthly aggregate data on average hourly earnings 
47qc0412 But the index is being replaced by the employment cost series 
47qc0413 Economists said the new index has the advantage of being a more reliable reading and the disadvantage of coming out only once a quarter rather than every month 
47qc0414 Newspapers\' costs are up sharply this year largely because of higher newsprint [cross_talk/] prices [/cross_talk] the industry\'s biggest cost behind labor expenses 
47qc0415 [tongue_click] Since October nineteen eighty six prices have risen three times by a total of about twenty one \%PERCENT 
47qc0416 Newspapers have responded by using lighter weight paper trimming page size and cutting the space for news 
47qc0417 [tongue_click] Meanwhile civil RICO continues to attract plaintiffs who want to turn general business disputes [loud_breath] that belong in state courts into federal offenses 
47qc0418 For example a small consortium of contractors who consulted me had submitted the low bid for a large marina to be constructed on Lake Michigan 
47qc0419 [loud_breath] The second lowest bidder recently filed a civil RICO action [loud_breath] claiming that misrepresentations were made by the successful bidders using the telephone [loud_breath] thereby committing federal wire fraud 
47qc041a [loud_breath] No matter what the determination of the suit the low bidders already have felt the sting of such poisonous words as racketeer

47rc0201 One problem with the development of the unpopular new W\. four form is that the I\. R\. S\. failed to test it adequately 
47rc0202 In fact the form wasn\'t shown to the public at all 
47rc0203 It was presented only to I\. R\. S\. employees in two of the agency\'s service centers 
47rc0204 Officials suggest that these clerical non technical workers really aren\'t much different from the general public 
47rc0205 Still Mr\. Gibbs concedes that the agency probably should have sought a wider view 
47rc0206 Mr\. Joynes will oversee the company\'s operating units as well as the company\'s research activities and staff support services the company said 
47rc0207 The spokesman wouldn\'t comment as to whether Mr\. Joynes [loud_breath] might succeed Mr\. Day as chairman 
47rc0208 Mr\. Day must retire at age sixty five

47rc020a If American and its union can\'t reach a settlement by then the airline can impose its latest contract offer or lock out its flight attendants 
47rc020b The Association of Professional Flight Attendants would also be free to strike [loud_breath] but it has said it doesn\'t plan to do so 
47rc020c The lastest disclosures [loud_breath] are an outgrowth of that probe 
47rc020d Already the Department of Transportation has accused Delta Airlines and Eastern Airlines of engaging in unrealistic scheduling at Atlanta\'s Hartsfield Airport 
47rc020e The carriers deny this but the government has expanded its probe 
47rc020f It has asked several other airlines to turn over their on time records at Dallas Fort Worth Chicago\'s O\'Hare and Boston\'s Logan airports

47rc020j A convention would open the door to a whole new group of leaders 
47rc020k An election to choose convention delegates [loud_breath] would be like a special election to pick a new Congress

47rc020w Wall Street analysts look to the interest in Houston based Enron Corp\.\`s oil and gas operations as a gauge of likely interest in Tenneco\'s properties 
47rc020x In late April Enron an integrated natural gas concern put oil and gas assets up for sale 
47rc020y Analysts valued those properties at two billion and one said Enron has received about twenty offers

47rc0210 Many people criticize ads that glorify junk 
47rc0211 Some singled out as a contradictory a cooking oil ad telling people how to cut down on cholesterol but featuring fried chicken and french fries 
47rc0212 It\'s also dishonest some said to omit information or hide it in small print 
47rc0213 They noted that ads for high fiber cereals neglect to mention their salt and sugar content 
47rc0214 I just checked this morning he said 
47rc0215 Bids were down a quarter to a half a point and I\'m told they\'re now starting to come back 
47rc0216 It\'s business as usual 
47rc0217 Volume is no different 
47rc0218 The market hasn\'t changed character 
47rc0219 So far from a market viewpoint it doesn\'t look to be much of an event 
47rc021a Ever since he took office three and a half years ago Mr\. Gorbachev has sought to increase foreign trade\'s meager share of the Soviet economy 
47rc021b Rather than simply import more Western goods he would like to obtain the machinery and know how to enable the Soviets to make the goods themselves 
47rc021c To do so he opened up the economy to foreign capital and equipment by permitting joint ventures 
47rc021d He returned home in time for his fifteenth birthday in March nineteen eighty six 
47rc021e As part of the treatment he attended fifteen weeks of after care five days a week

47rc0302 Leaflets that are being delivered to twenty three million households warn that AIDS isn\'t limited to homosexuals 
47rc0303 Officials say television warnings will follow 
47rc0304 The issue is so sensitive here says bond analyst Daniel Scotto of L\. F\. Rothschild Unterberg and Towbin 
47rc0305 We are all concerned that the regulators can sit back and wait for credit to carry out the company out into the horizon 
47rc0306 But he added the bankers are waiting for commitments from the regulators and the regulators are waiting for commitments from the bankers 
47rc0307 In heavy trading Friday profit taking caused the Nikkei average to slip seventy \.POINT one eight to twenty one thousand one oh five \.POINT eight five

47rc030m Earnings in the past were somewhat erratic quarter to quarter because of the major business was real estate syndication 
47rc030n Now the S\. and L\. holding company is the main business with a down sized real estate syndication 
47rc030o Core earnings are very consistent 
47rc030p Another option would be going private in a leveraged buy out 
47rc030q But analysts said management wouldn\'t prefer such a plan because it would mean curtailing the company\'s ambitious store expansion program 
47rc030r In a leveraged buy out a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely with borrowing 
47rc030s Ultimately the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company\'s operations [loud_breath] or the sale of its assets

47rc030y A spokesman for Cray described the M\. I\. T\. decision as good news 
47rc030z Assuming the bidding does open up again it means there\'s room for technical considerations and not considerations based purely on price 
47rc0310 The spokesman said it would have been impossible for Cray to install and operate a complete supercomputer system at the prices M\. I\. T\. wanted to pay 
47rc0311 But while nickel and especially copper quotes have since rebounded aluminum prices have continued to tumble 
47rc0312 It seems to be in people\'s interest to keep the price down right now says one London exchange trader

47rc0318 Mr\. Peroni agreed that the U\. S\. currency is a positive factor for stock prices 
47rc0319 The better behavior of the dollar is a big incentive for foreign and domestic institutions to stick both feet in the water he said 
47rc031a He predicted that the Dow Jones industrials could be as high as the upper twenty two hundreds by the end of the summer 
47rc031b However John Mendelson chief market analyst at Dean Witter\'s Reynolds believes such a *slump* could happen 
47rc031c I think you would go back to normal turnover levels in a bear market 
47rc031d [loud_breath] You have to go through nineteen seventy four to see a real dull lousy market 
47rc031e Turnover level that year sixteen \.POINT five \%PERCENT

47rc0404 But it will take a lot of acquisitions for specialty retailing to have much effect on Sears\'s bottom line 
47rc0405 Sears\'s merchandise group alone generated profits of seven hundred and sixty five \.POINT seven million in nineteen eighty five 
47rc0406 Indeed analysts say that in the past Sears may have been hesitant to buy specialty stores because they wouldn\'t quickly contribute to profit 
47rc0407 However a Sears spokesman said yesterday that the company doesn\'t have any qualifications about how quickly or how much specialty acquisitions would have to contribute to earnings 
47rc0408 Dillard Department Stores Inc\. is offering fifty million dollars of twelve year eight \%PERCENT notes priced at ninety nine and one quarter

47rc040c The Little Rock Arkansas based retailer said it will use the proceeds to retire debt to finance operations and for other general purposes 
47rc040d The investment unit said it will use proceeds to buy customer accounts receivable growing out of the parent\'s retail sales

47uc020p The French were so impressed by the celebration they thanked the U\. S\. in an ad in a New York newspaper 
47uc020q [tongue_click] In the end there is little the U\. S\. can do to control events in South Africa 
47uc020r The administration\'s six year constructive engagement policy designed to coax Pretoria toward dismantling apartheid didn\'t succeed 
47uc020s And sanctions in the short run won\'t damage South Africa\'s self reliant economy 
47uc020t But the perception of inaction has diplomatic costs for the U\. S\. and so for the time being sanctions seem to be the best bet 
47uc020u The nineteen seventy two A\. B\. M\. treaty requires a review every five years 
47uc020v Communiques announcing completion of the first and second reviews were issued on November fourth nineteen seventy seven and November ninth nineteen eighty two

47uc0214 The Speaker retaliated in a public statement and his minions in the leadership said the group was dead on Capitol Hill 
47uc0215 This was rough on all debtors domestic as well as international 
47uc0216 But no one proposed solutions for domestic debtors as grand as those officially offered for Third World debtors 
47uc0217 The first part of the official proposal was to reduce the in- interest burden of the developing countries 
47uc0218 Second promote world economic recovery 
47uc0219 Third new loans should be made to the debtor nations by the banks the International Monetary Fund the World Bank and export credit agencies 
47uc021a In any case a return to market discipline is inevitable 
47uc021b Financial history has witnessed a thousand booms and busts 
47uc021c [tongue_click] Within recent memory we have seen the junk equities of the sixties the heated Third World lending of the seventies and the thrift crisis of the eighties 
47uc021d These problems of the recent past pale in scope next to the pervasiveness and total dollars involved in the current craze 
47uc021e If the participants in this craze awaken now the correction may still be within tolerable limits for the country

47uc0304 It\'s so shunned that although most managers going up the ladder are occasionally required to fire once having ascended to the top they delegate the job 
47uc0305 Andrew Sherwood a New York management consultant says that only about five \%PERCENT of chief executives do their own firing 
47uc0306 These are people who are compulsive builders he says 
47uc0307 They like acquiring companies making profits go up and recruiting people 
47uc0308 Firing isn\'t what they\'re emotionally geared for 
47uc0309 They find it repugnant 
47uc030a Defenders of the footnote argue that it makes sense as tax policy 
47uc030b Why they ask should wealthy best selling authors get substantial tax deferrals while mom and pop manufacturers for example can\'t

47uc030g Western Union has said that if its plans are defeated it will file for reorganization under Chapter eleven of the federal bankruptcy laws 
47uc030h The confrontation in federal court may break new ground in bankruptcy law 
47uc030i Other courts notably the one in charge of the Manville Corporation Chapter eleven proceedings have set up trust funds to pay large classes of injury victims 
47uc030j But Manville\'s two \.POINT five billion dollars to three billion dollar trust includes provisions that allow it to expand if funds prove inadequate to pay asbestos related claims 
47uc030k So far no judge has attempted to fix an absolute cap on a group of claims as huge and uncertain as those facing Robins 
47uc030l Another bank trader attributes the dollar\'s rebound to federal officials\' increased openness about their activities 
47uc030m They\'re trying to get the biggest bang for the buck right now the trader says

47uc0319 Doctor Sullivan had concluded that even if he pushed the Fulton nomination through the White House and the Senate the price of victory would be too high

47uc040s A federal district court and an appeals court both in Richmond upheld the plan

47vc020z [loud_breath] Another potential point of contention is the E\. C\.\'s plan to allow the free flow of people across borders 
47vc0210 [loud_breath] Switzerland already has attracted one million resident aliens a portion of its population greater than in any E\. C\. state except Luxembourg 
47vc0211 [tongue_click] Most Swiss think that is enough and the country has imposed foreign worker quotas so strict that skilled labor is in short supply

47vc0301 [lip_smack] The new government has started to lower personal income taxes and at the same time it has begun to bring its own spending under control 
47vc0302 In the nineteen eighty seven budget the highest rate of income tax was lowered to fifty eight \%PERCENT from sixty five \%PERCENT 
47vc0303 This is part of a world wide movement that France must follow to keep its most energetic aggressive and bright young people and to attract investors

47vc0305 Such trusts aren\'t completely inviolate creditors can claim the money after a bankruptcy for instance

47vc0309 [tongue_click] Food prices in Japan take forty \%PERCENT or more of the average person\'s wage 
47vc030a With housing taking another forty \%PERCENT and the fact that the Japanese are great savers they are left with almost no discretionary income 
47vc030b This is why they cannot develop a domestic market 
47vc030c They don\'t have money to spend except a small amount of savings that they spend only on special occasions or for unusual bargains 
47vc030d [tongue_click] Consequently Lloyd\'s and some brokers may be forced to increase their share of the settlement payment

47vc0314 [tongue_click] The increasing use of labor may be because of a tremendous boom in the output of goods and services she said

47vc0318 [tongue_click] It\'s been such a pessimistic atmosphere in the past couple of weeks 
47vc0319 [tongue_click] Analysts say they expect P\. and G\'s momentum to carry into nineteen ninety and beyond and many raised their fiscal nineteen ninety estimates 
47vc031a Brenda Lee Landry of Morgan Stanley raised her estimate to eight dollars and thirty cents from an earlier estimate of eight dollars and fifteen cents 
47vc031b Kidder\'s Mr\. Freedman and Joseph Kozloff at Drexel Burnham Lambert raised their estimates to eight dollars and fifty cents a share from eight dollars and twenty five cents

47vc040j They are equally determined to repel African National Congress terrorism inside South Africa [door_slam] 
47vc040k To these people the E\. C\. C\. is nothing but a band of left wing cowards 
47vc040l October thirty one Waste Management\'s board meets 
47vc040m ChemLawn is discussed only briefly and is ruled out as a takeover target by Mr\. Buntrock 
47vc040n Officials at the company say ChemLawn didn\'t belong on the agenda under pending acquisitions in the first place 
47vc040o Mr\. Hamm who was here to meet with some of his clients among the OPEC countries said supply and demand in the oil market is balanced 
47vc040p [tongue_click] But he said it\'s balanced at fifteen to sixteen dollars a barrel 
47vc040q That is two to three dollars a barrel less than the exporters were receiving last year 
47vc040r If there is a reduction in supply as a result of the joint meetings prices will shoot up Mr\. Hamm said 
47vc040s [tongue_click] Carbide\'s sabotage theory is weakened partly because it hasn\'t disclosed all its evidence 
47vc040t Though its attorneys say they have interviewed the alleged saboteur extensively they won\'t disclose his name or whereabouts or describe him 
47vc040u They also decline to say whether they understand his motives or have any witnesses 
47vc040v Stanford now chooses not to require its undergraduates to study their Western heritage but that history does yield certain lessons 
47vc040w One of them is that minorities that do not respond effectively to attacks from the majority merely encourage further assaults 
47vc040x Perhaps the Hoover overseers should keep that in mind when they ponder the latest affront to Glenn Campbell next week 
47vc040y The offer is a brilliant defense contrived by Santa Fe\'s investment bankers at Salomon Brothers and Goldman Sachs 
47vc040z The sixty three dollar a share price will hang over the negotiations like smog over Los Angeles 
47vc0410 And though Mr\. Dingman will offer package after package that seems to add up to sixty three dollars he doesn\'t really plan to meet the asking price 
47vc0411 Instead he hopes to persuade Santa Fe to take less 
47vc0412 Separately Judge Browning issued a ruling on the award of any damages in the case 
47vc0413 For claims in the federal case the standard of damages is out of pocket or investors\' loss on the bonds 
47vc0414 For Washington state claims the standard is recission which could mean repaying bondholders their purchase price 
47vc0415 The dispute is a classic confrontation between market philosophies 
47vc0416 Washington believes that Japan profits from free U\. S\. markets and should reciprocate with completely free Japanese markets 
47vc0417 Tokyo government bureaucrats claim to favor free markets in practice they often are loath to relinquish complete control especially in promising industries 
47vc0418 Long a secretive partnership Proudfoot now aims to muscle its way toward the top of the consulting industry 
47vc0419 It has the financial backing of a big British investment firm M\. I\. M\. Britannia Limited and went public last year 
47vc041a It used the two hundred and twenty one million dollars in proceeds to buy out a handful of older partners 
47vc041b Alexander Proudfoot P\. L\. C\. which is listed on the London Stock Exchange is currently looking for other consulting firms to acquire to broaden its practice 
47vc041c [tongue_click] Finally some predict states will take the lead in expanding bank powers 
47vc041d Already twenty two states give their banks more freedom than federally chartered banks have to engage in insurance and real estate 
47vc041e [tongue_click] California has a ballot referendum this fall on letting banks sell insurance 
47vc041f Delaware currently allows some securities underwriting by state chartered banks Ms\. Shaw notes and New York has debated a similar move

47wc0204 For Kodak a five hundred million dollar penalty would represent about a dollar fifty a share after taxes 
47wc0205 It might be seen as a victory for Kodak says Alex 
47wc0206 Brown analyst Otis Brady in a recent report 
47wc0207 Yesterday Kodak climbed two and three quarters to seventy five and three eighths 
47wc0208 It reported first quarter profit rose to seventy nine cents a share from twenty two cents a share

47wc020c Last week Salomon Brothers Incorporated launched its Salomon Russell Global Equity Index tracking three \.POINT five six five trillion dollars of equities world wide 
47wc020d Three similar measures are already available 
47wc020e Laszlo Birinyi Junior vice president for Salomon\'s equity market analysis group says We\'re trying to provide reliable consistent information on global securities 
47wc020f Bankers say Chile Mexico and the Philippines have accounted for most of the estimated six billion of debt equity swaps to date 
47wc020g Some bankers have estimated that the total may rise as high as ten billion this year 
47wc020h Such swaps only began about three years ago 
47wc020i Albert Gross chief economist at Refco Incorporated agreed 
47wc020j The bond market was helped temporarily by a decline in gold and other commodity prices a strengthening dollar and stock market rally he said 
47wc020k [lip_smack] But I expect the dollar to continue falling and that will accelerate inflation pressures 
47wc020l The best numbers on inflation are behind us 
47wc020m Most of the damage to stock prices came in the late afternoon as bond prices sagged adding fuel to the fire of interest rate fears 
47wc020n Bonds in turn seemed to be reacting to a decline in the dollar off its highs early in the day 
47wc020o The dollar nevertheless showed a gain for the day against both the yen and the West German mark 
47wc020p Bids totaling three hundred seventy six million dollars were submitted 
47wc020q Accepted bids ranged from seven \.POINT one five \%PERCENT to seven \.POINT one seven three \%PERCENT 
47wc020r The bank holding company slated another fifty million dollar sale next Tuesday 
47wc020s Mr\. Reagan\'s comments don\'t reflect any change in his interpretation of the deficit reduction agreement 
47wc020t At the insistence of the White House the plan specifically noted that the president could either sign or veto the specific taxes Congress chooses 
47wc020u And the administration has said before that it isn\'t happy with the provision on takeovers 
47wc020v However such an agreement may yet occur 
47wc020w There\'s a lot brewing here said one source close to Apple 
47wc020x This is only the first of several related announcements and undertakings 
47wc020y The source said technical agreements are easier to hammer out than marketing agreements 
47wc020z Mobil based in New York said its fourth quarter net income jumped ninety two \%PERCENT 
47wc0210 The latest quarter included a one hundred forty million dollar write down of foreign inventories 
47wc0211 Revenue rose twenty five \%PERCENT to fifteen \.POINT six six billion dollars from twelve \.POINT five billion dollars 
47wc0212 In recent months the quota program itself has become increasingly controversial 
47wc0213 Some big U\. S\. steelmakers which sell semifinished steel in the domestic marketplace are fighting to continue quotas after their scheduled expiration September thirtieth 
47wc0214 Others though dependent on outside supplies of semifinished are pushing to end quotas 
47wc0215 The Singapore government invites foreign newspapers to print the truth about Singapore 
47wc0216 But why has The Asian Wall Street Journal refused to print government replies correcting errors and biases in its reporting 
47wc0217 Why does it deny the Singapore government the simple right of reply 
47wc0218 One big play last year was leisure 
47wc0219 Another was undervalued assets even though no one can recall a Japanese company being broken up for its assets 
47wc021a Once you get that theme the level of the P\. E\. *ratio* doesn\'t mean a damn says Mr\. Robins 
47wc021b It\'s all a bit of a mirage 
47wc021c Yet one that so far has worked 
47wc021d Nine month results also include a twelve million dollar net loss from the disposition of trucking operations 
47wc021e About eight million dollars of the trucking charge was taken in the third quarter 
47wc021f Year earlier results were restated for accounting changes 
47wc0301 When Ms\. Higa took over the business in nineteen sixty six frozen pizza was still a long shot 
47wc0302 The average Japanese didn\'t have freezer space let alone an oven 
47wc0303 And the most common response to supermarket taste tests was that the cheese looked and tasted like soap she recalls 
47wc0304 But she kept going peddling her pizzas to restaurants and fancy hotels 
47wc0305 Smokers are feeling the heat because companies are taking a harder line on such issues as productivity rising medical costs and the effects of passive smoke 
47wc0306 Although there are conflicting claims about whether smokers cost employers more in terms of higher insurance rates and absenteeism companies often cite such concerns to justify restrictive smoking policies 
47wc0307 In addition new state and local ordinances and employee complaints put significant pressure on many companies 
47wc0308 The government civil suit alleged that a defect could cause the rear brakes to lock sending the car spinning out of control 
47wc0309 [tongue_click] G\. M\. which no longer makes X\. cars denied that the brakes are defective 
47wc030a Agreeing with G\. M\. Judge Jackson ruled that the government came to court with nothing more essentially than a reasonable suspicion that a defect existed 
47wc030b The suit which also names the company\'s directors as defendants says the directors have given personal gain a priority over the interests of public shareholders 
47wc030c A second suit by Moshe J\. Schwartz Jeffrey Abrams Stanley Heineman and James T\. Cain contains comparable charges 
47wc030d Earlier at least two of those same plaintiffs filed a suit over the Antar stock sales 
47wc030e A loss wasn\'t unexpected given Continental\'s operational difficulties that developed in the quarter 
47wc030f However the results of Texas Air\'s subsidiaries are the reverse of what many analysts had predicted earlier in the year 
47wc030g Instead of a modest profit at low cost Continental by the second quarter the newly expanded unit has struggled with losses 
47wc030h Its higher cost sister Eastern Airlines has shown signs of financial progress despite continuing confrontations with its employee unions 
47wc030i Mr\. Lay said the losses occured in late September and early this month a time of particular volatility in oil markets 
47wc030j There were two senior people colluding and keeping a separate set of books apart from the official books for a few weeks Mr\. Lay said 
47wc030k Their guesses were wrong on both sides of the market 
47wc030l An F\. T\. C\. spokesman declined to comment 
47wc030m The investigation was first reported in F\. T\. C\. Watch a publication about regulatory matters 
47wc030n Reached in New York last night Mr\. Trump confirmed that the F\. T\. C\. had made the request 
47wc030o He declined to elaborate 
47wc030p Separately Wall Street speculation grew that media investor Rupert Murdoch was considering acquiring a stake in London based W\. P\. P\. 
47wc030q A Murdoch aide said that Mr\. Murdoch has been looking for a long time at the company 
47wc030r But a W\. P\. P\. spokesman said that there has been no contact and there has been no acquisition of W\. P\. P\. shares by Murdoch 
47wc030s Yesterday people close to Federated\'s board said that the company was still open to yet another friendly merger proposal from Campeau 
47wc030t If they\'ve got something to show us we\'ll take a look at it 
47wc030u They know where to find us said one source 
47wc030v We\'re not stonewalling them 
47wc030w I can\'t guarantee our group is a hundred \%PERCENT solid said an official at Suez a French holding company 
47wc030x I can\'t tell you that at those prices there won\'t be any reneging on agreements signed by the consortium\'s members 
47wc030y But he added such actions could lead to a legal reprisals 
47wc030z Both sides have worked hard and some progress has been realized in a number of areas said Messrs\. 
47wc0310 Shultz and Shevardnadze in a joint statement last night 
47wc0311 But much more needs to be done 
47wc0312 The United Nations whose garbage bill is forty two thousand dollars a month is served by National Carting Company which won the pickup rights eight years ago 
47wc0313 Last December the U\. N\. didn\'t attempt to solicit bids 
47wc0314 It simply extended its contract with National Carting 
47wc0315 Soliciting bids in this particular industry is not the way to go a U\. N\. spokesman says implying that it is futile 
47wc0316 But critics charged that the collar actually added to volatility by making it more difficult for index *arbitragers* to do their business 
47wc0317 Many traders argue that such arbitrage has the effect of smoothing out volatility in the markets 
47wc0318 Index arbitragers buy and sell large amounts of stocks and stock index futures to take advantage of brief price disparities between the two related instruments 
47wc0319 The scene the Annual Norman Mailer Cocktail Party and Fist Fight 
47wc031a Candice Bergen and Woody Allen had just joined a group of pseudo intellectuals and were rambling with the best of them 
47wc031b I often think observed Ms\. Bergen that if Dostoevski had been a singer he\'d have sounded like Ray Charles 
47wc031c The other non winners most notably Exxon were in many ways as noteworthy as the winners 
47wc031d It is believed that Exxon was outbid for several reserve packages leaving it with a lot of cash that could still be earmarked for acquisitions 
47wc031e At the Houston Petroleum Club industry officials couldn\'t eat lunch of late without discussing speculation that Exxon was going to walk away with all of the Tenneco properties 
47wc031f An Exxon *spokeswoman* said it was company policy not to comment on anything to do with acquisitions 
47wc0401 Also selling well was a fifty million dollar issue of revenue bonds by the Florida Department of Natural Resources 
47wc0402 The unsold balance was about ten \.POINT three million dollars 
47wc0403 The bonds were priced after auction to yield from four \.POINT two \%PERCENT in nineteen eighty eight to seven \.POINT two \%PERCENT in two thousand twelve 
47wc0404 Moody\'s rated the bonds single A\. while S\. and P\. rated them single A\. minus 
47wc0405 Goldman Sachs and Company was the lead underwriter 
47wc0406 Still he would have preferred there be no bids at all 
47wc0407 The company\'s policy for eighty five years has been to be independent and grow and we have succeeded he says 
47wc0408 We are evaluating the offers for the company and for the shareholders but we profoundly regret the situation 
47wc0409 So strange is the situation that one Holly director has proposed changing the company\'s name to Fantasy Sugar Company 
47wc040a He says that could entice Shamrock because of its Disney connection to buy the company 
47wc040b Just think of how much they could make on the movie rights he adds 
47wc040c During the past several days corporations and other big investors have refrained from lending Treasury bonds and notes to securities dealers for brief periods 
47wc040d That in turn has forced many dealers to refrain from selling borrowed securities or amassing so called short positions 
47wc040e It\'s hard to short anything in this market at the moment said a trader at a large government securities dealer 
47wc040f Mr\. Antoniu denies any wrongdoing 
47wc040g I don\'t have anything to worry about the former investment banker says 
47wc040h I have always followed the advice of my lawyer and accountants 
47wc040i He says that he has cooperated in an inquiry by Florida officials but that he isn\'t aware the matter has been referred to the attorney general\'s office 
47wc040j In any case he says Sport About\'s problems will be cured by the public offering and are commonplace in any rapidly growing franchise business 
47wc040k Where can we find some clues to the answer or at least a possible answer to this question 
47wc040l I would suggest that we look at the one Marxist Leninist state that already has gone quite far down the revisionist road 
47wc040m I refer to the curiously neglected instance of Yugoslavia 
47wc040n Outside of the congressional leadership patience is wearing thin on pork barreling continuing resolutions 
47wc040o There are even congressmen who say they want to pass separate budget bills this year 
47wc040p We\'ll see 
47wc040q What seems more likely is that either a President or the courts or both someday will have to rescue the veto by forcing Congress to give up its arrogant ways 
47wc040r [tongue_click] So far we\'ve found that federal employees have dealt with this issue with a great deal of sensitivity and common sense Mrs\. Horner said 
47wc040s But there is a need for clarity 
47wc040t These guidelines will serve as reassurance to our managers 
47wc040u Senator Bentsen\'s corporate tax proposal would replace a provision in the committee bill allowing the Internal Revenue Service to withhold refunds from taxpayers who have defaulted on government loans 
47wc040v This provision wouldn\'t raise any money in the current fiscal year and Senator Bentsen wanted something that would allow a quicker end to the diesel tax collection

47wc040x Makers world wide have been racing to develop compact disk recorders

47wc0412 The company is headed by Drew Lewis frequently a troubleshooter for the Republicans 
47wc0413 The National Association of *Realtors* is throwing several parties and proudly boasts that eighty nine of its members are delegates or alternates to this convention 
47wc0414 Discussion of this subject better described as brooding about it is filled with misconceptions 
47wc0415 One of these is the great concern with the U\. S\. having become a net debtor 
47wc0416 What is meant by that is that Americans apparently own fewer assets abroad than foreigners own in the U\. S\. 
47wc0417 Many people have pointed out that these calculations are spurious because the assets are not all valued on the same basis 
47wc0418 If all assets were valued at today\'s prices the net debt of the U\. S\. would certainly be much smaller than it now appears and might be a net asset 
47wc0419 Investors taking part in the financing will lend Venezuela one billion in exchange for monthly payments from the New York trust fund 
47wc041a Those payments will be set when the financing is completed which is expected in mid December 
47wc041b The interest rate will be based on the five year U\. S\. Treasury bond rate plus a still undecided interest rate margin the Venezuelan official said 
47wc041c Investors continue to flock to the more conservative stock portfolios

47xc020a [tongue_click] Other toy makers such as Mattel Inc\. have been bringing out new products earlier in the year to increase sales at times other than Christmas 
47xc020b But Tyco\'s day after Christmas launch is unusual 
47xc020c The toy business is ripe for some marketing innovation after two years of relatively flat sales says Rick Anguilla editor of Toy and Hobby World magazine 
47xc020d If Tyco succeeds others will certainly follow 
47xc020e No one seems quite sure how the publisher juggles his assets among his various companies which include the publicly owned Maxwell Communication Corp\. and various private ones 
47xc020f Control of the public company and of private interests like Mirror Group Newspapers Limited rests with a foundation in Liechtenstein Pergamon Holding Foundation about which little is disclosed 
47xc020g He says its beneficiaries are charities which he promises to identify someday soon 
47xc020h The Bank of Italy also reportedly sold marks to buy Italian lire 
47xc020i The transactions may have been directed mainly at defending the sagging lira in the European Monetary System in which eight European currencies float within specified limits 
47xc020j But they also had the effect of helping the dollar by increasing the supply of marks in the market 
47xc020k [tongue_click] For Environmental Treatment which like Mr\. Kirk relishes an extremely low profile the oil spill has brought a wave of attention 
47xc020l In fact when Wall Street learned that the publicly held company was hired to handle the multimillion dollar cleanup the concern\'s stock shot up almost u- ten \%PERCENT

47xc020s The suspicion of a selection based entirely on political instead of substantive grounds will be undercut

47xc020u Mr\. Tucker\'s hard hitting campaign has in turn appalled top union leaders who say he has tarnished their reputation as one of the labor movement\'s cleanest organizations 
47xc020v The statements of an undemocratic union being in bed with management hurts this union said Mr\. Bieber 
47xc020w I resent those statements 
47xc020x Mr\. Delchamps said thirty \%PERCENT of the company\'s stock outstanding is held by people who have agreed not to sell their holdings before October thirty first 
47xc020y Another twenty five \%PERCENT is held under the company\'s employee stock ownership plan 
47xc020z Most of the people in the former category are expected to extend the no sell agreement for another year he said 
47xc0210 O\. T\. C\. brokers also stress that their stocks often outperform listed ones on a n- long term basis 
47xc0211 And overall the Nasdaq Composite Index is up thirteen \%PERCENT this year twice as much as the Dow Jones Industrial Average 
47xc0212 Also they note the tiny stocks that generally trade under three dollars a share have always taken big percentage moves up or down when they move at all 
47xc0213 These mixed feelings of frustration with and gratitude toward the authorities are part of the everyday life of a foreigner doing business in Korea 
47xc0214 In fact such contradictions are what seem to make the Korean world go round 
47xc0215 A Western businessman needs to be ready for them 
47xc0216 Here are a f:ew hard learned facts of Korean business life 
47xc0217 There are also broker finders that get fees merely for matching borrowers and lenders of stock 
47xc0218 Broker finders can also include the brokerage firms themselves 
47xc0219 The government is investigating whether all the payments that fly to and from such broker finders are legitimate 
47xc021a [tongue_click] We are extremely selective said Paul Suckrow director of fixed income at Oppenheimer Management Corporation 
47xc021b [tongue_click] I don\'t think some issues are going to make it he said 
47xc021c Even cautious managers such as Mr\. Suckow are seeing the impact of the Campeau debacle 
47xc021d He says his firm owns a small amount of the Federated senior debt 
47xc021e Although the bonds are secured by bank credits they have also fallen in price recently 
47xc0301 The p- computer also can display a pattern showing how people normally place the tongue to produce say an s\. sound 
47xc0302 A deaf person can then try to match the pattern by placing the tongue against the electronic palate 
47xc0303 With careful coaching and trial and error children like Miss Gilroy can learn how to make sounds that require placing the tongue against the roof of the mouth

47xc030c Within two hours Dayton Hudson common hit fifty nine dollars a share on the Big Board and up to sixty three dollars in other markets 
47xc030d People took positions in the stock simply on the rumor of a takeover by someone no one had ever heard of 
47xc030e Some of the full time risk takers don\'t even need public announcements to plunge 
47xc030f Nor do they require inside information a la Ivan Boesky who was venal but not insane 
47xc030g The people who invested in Dayton Hudson however were mad

47xc030j T\. L\. C\. Group said yesterday that it has a firm commitment from Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc\. its investment banker to finance its acquisition

47xc030s At the meeting shareholders approved an increase in authorized common shares to twenty million from fifteen million 
47xc030t The additional shares may be used for benefit plans to obtain additional financing or to make acquisitions 
47xc030u The company has about ten \.POINT eight million common shares outstanding 
47xc030v The U\. S\. of course has a vast and in many places efficient infrastructure 
47xc030w The council study put a value of one trillion on the parts it measured 
47xc030x But government owned fixed capital s:uffers along with privately owned plant and equipment when economic policies discourage long term investment 
47xc030y The greatest scourge of the investment is of course inflation which explains why the national infrastructure suffer particularly during the nineteen seventies 
47xc030z [tongue_click] User fees simply could not keep up with the soaring costs of loans and construction 
47xc0310 Highway construction had the added problem of reduced yields from gasoline taxes brought about by energy shortages and shortage enforced conservation 
47xc0311 [tongue_click] The measure was a bold move for a president who has come to view inertia as the best form of security 
47xc0312 The suspension effectively will slash salaries and cut an estimated eight \.POINT three billion from federal spending this year 
47xc0313 The aim is to hold the budget deficit to four \.POINT nine \%PERCENT of economic output down from a projected seven \%PERCENT 
47xc0314 [tongue_click] This it is hoped will help stop inf(lation)- high inflation from spiraling into hyperinflation 
47xc0315 The think tank measured expense ratios which are a fund\'s operating costs as a percentage of assets 
47xc0316 For investors high ratios are clearly of concern 
47xc0317 It cuts into potential return even when a fund is doing well 
47xc0318 [tongue_click] And it leaves a fund with less of a cushion in case performance sours 
47xc0319 Almost unnoticed in discussions of the procurement scandal is the fact that this elaborate indeed tortuous system seems to have worked at least on its own terms 
47xc031a Nobody was able to throw a contract directly 
47xc031b Instead what some contractors seem to have done is to buy inside information that would allow them to prepare a better proposal 
47xc031c [tongue_click] Nine month results also include a twelve million net loss from the disposition of trucking operations 
47xc031d About eight million of the trucking charge was taken in the third quarter

47xc0401 [tongue_click] The big problem is that Doctor Thanos can no longer use so called passive losses from these properties to offset his salary or earned income 
47xc0402 [tongue_click] The disallowance of passive losses is being phased in over five years 
47xc0403 Real estate depreciation schedules also have been lengthened reducing their value 
47xc0404 While the U\. S\. focuses on the Iran Contra hearings more Soviet arms flow into Nicaragua 
47xc0405 More than three hundred million dollars worth of weapons were delivered to the Sandinistas in the first half of this year according to U\. S\. intelligence 
47xc0406 That\'s about nine times the direct U\. S\. military aid provided to the Contras in that period 
47xc0407 The Soviet equipment is just pouring in one ranking Pentagon official told the A\. P\. 
47xc0408 The Nicaraguans are consolidating their military building and adding to it everything imaginable 
47xc0409 Art collectors and dealers heaved a sigh of relief last night 
47xc040a After high prices and frantic bidding at art auctions last spring about one in four works didn\'t sell at a contemporary art auction at Christie\'s 
47xc040b But at least the market didn\'t crash 
47xc040c Citicorp\'s loss for the year stemmed from a three billion dollar addition in the second quarter to loss reserves for loans to developing countries 
47xc040d [tongue_click] Excluding one time gains and losses Citicorp\'s nineteen eighty seven profit would have been one \.POINT one five billion dollars 
47xc040e Excluded are gains on real estate in the fourth quarter and pension assets in the third quarter plus the effect of the reserve addition 
47xc040f Some reporters were more original 
47xc040g A pair from a local paper asked Edsel if he favored casino gambling in Detroit a concept heavily promoted by Mayor Coleman Young 
47xc040h The strangest inquiry lobbed at Bill was What role I saw at Ford for my daughters who are two years old and two months old 
47xc040i I thought that was kind of putting the cart before the horse I wanted to get them out of kindergarten first 
47xc040j And what if the foundry can\'t keep up with Cummins\'s demand

47xc040z What\'s wrong with that 
47xc0410 But Fred McIntyre a railroad worker in Omaha Nebraska vows that he will never invest in the market again for the rest of my life 
47xc0411 With good reason 
47xc0412 As Black Monday dawned he held in his brokerage account a handsome nest egg of more than four times his thirty thousand dollar a year pay 
47xc0413 The next day all of it was gone and he owed his broker more than three hundred thousand dollars to boot 
47xc0414 David Meister F\. N\. N\.\'s president acknowledged the company has been in discussions with other media concerns but he declined to identify them 
47xc0415 We\'ve spoken to virtually every company you can imagine plus a half dozen more you wouldn\'t think of Mr\. Meister said 
47xc0416 He denied industry speculation that F\. N\. N\. is looking to sell the company 
47xc0417 We\'re not interested in selling and we\'re not soliciting anything he said 
47xc0418 [tongue_click] However he added that\'s not to say we wouldn\'t entertain any reasonable offer for at least a piece of F\. N\. N\. 
47xc0419 In a related matter a review commission administrative law judge on October eighteenth threw out OSHA citations against Morrell 
47xc041a The citations issued in April nineteen eighty seven charged record keeping violations 
47xc041b The official disallowed OSHA\'s instance by instance citation which proposed a total fine of six hundred and ninety thousand dollars 
47xc041c [tongue_click] The off:icial also said OSHA didn\'t issue the citation within the six months specified by law from the time an official inspection begins 
47yc0201 To curb domestic consumption and salvage the trade surplus Brazil\'s economic planners recently imposed a tough package of tax and price increases

47yc0203 And a general strike has been tentatively set for December twelfth 
47yc0204 Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value 
47yc0205 Thus higher bidding narrows the investor\'s return while lower bidding widens it 
47yc0206 The percentage rates are calculated on a three hundred and sixty day year while the coupon equivalent yield is based on a three hundred and sixty five day year 
47yc0207 The lastest disclosures are an outgrowth of that probe 
47yc0208 Already the Department of Transportation has accused Delta Airlines and Eastern Airlines of engaging in unrealistic scheduling at Atlanta\'s Hartsfield Airport 
47yc0209 The carriers deny this but the government has expanded its probe 
47yc020a It has asked several other airlines to turn over their on time records at Dallas Fort Worth Chicago\'s O\'Hare and Boston\'s Logan airports 
47yc020b It was a wonderful day for the bond markets said Michael J\. Connery a senior vice president of financial futures at Chicago based Refco Incorporated 
47yc020c All the apparent signs of inflation were deflated 
47yc020d And that\'s led to a tremendous amount of short covering or traders and investors buying back securities that they had borrowed and sold 
47yc020e Still whatever the risk of garbage burning the alternative landfill is worse says Mr\. McManus the publisher of Resource Recovery Report 
47yc020f Indeed many older landfills weren\'t properly constructed to contain the toxic substances now leaching from decaying trash 
47yc020g In many states water and air quality is threatened 
47yc020h [tongue_click] New York City\'s Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island for one dumps four million gallons of toxic liquid into nearby freshwater streams every day 
47yc020i Even the traditional green stamp might become a thing of the past

47yc020s Sources said an announcement will be made this morning in Toronto followed by a news conference 
47yc020t Burns Fry\'s about seventy member board yesterday was presented with the proposal by its eleven member executive committee which already has approved the transaction 
47yc020u Security Pacific\'s board approved the transaction at a meeting a few days ago the sources said 
47yc020v The expected fourth quarter result would give the company profit of ten to twelve cents a share for all of nineteen eighty seven 
47yc020w It posted profit of twenty seven cents a share for nineteen eighty six including about fourteen cents a share from an accounting adjustment 
47yc020x The company didn\'t make estimates for nineteen eighty seven net income 
47yc020y At Schwab the nineteen eighty eight capital budget is about twenty \%PERCENT less than the amount being spent this year according to Lawrence Stupski Schwab\'s president 
47yc020z Before the crash Schwab expected to open thirty new offices in the next two years 
47yc0210 But Mr\. Stupski said that number had been cut about fifty \%PERCENT because of the outlook for lower volumes 
47yc0211 Off the hook The resignation of Justice Department criminal division chief Weld erases Rhode Island Republican\'s Saint Germain\'s risk of indictment for taking meals from lobbyists 
47yc0212 Agency lawyers who ran a grand jury investigation urged no action citing House rules allowing nearly unlimited entertainment 
47yc0213 Weld was reluctant to drop the case 
47yc0214 Robert Ravitz a Grey senior vice president says the agency did the best it could based on drawings of the coin 
47yc0215 Responding to Miss Jones\'s comments he says I don\'t know what her problem is with the artwork 
47yc0216 It was an incredible time crunch 
47yc0217 If we had longer time I\'m sure we could have massaged the artwork to death 
47yc0218 So far the administration has ignored these appeals and so have Mr\. Reed and other bankers 
47yc0219 It seems that the principles enunciated at the beginning of this decade by Messrs\. 
47yc021a Wriston and Theobald still prevail if not in lending the bank\'s money at least in suggesting that other investors put up the cash 
47yc021b But experience shows that once an upscale product puts its name on lower priced goods it can never go back up 
47yc021c Revlon Group Incorporated for example is making a long shot attempt to rekindle the Halston flame 
47yc021d Revlon owner of Halston Enterprises Incorporated has visions of seeing Halston label clothes back in better dress departments 
47yc021e But marketers believe the company has a credibility problem after its six year association with retailer J\. C\. Penney Company which ended last year 
47yc0301 But when leveraged buyout companies sell stock the big winners usually are a tight circle of executives and investment bankers who earlier bought control 
47yc0302 Profits often exceed ten times these investors\' original stake 
47yc0303 These giant concentrated payoffs from leveraged buyouts are starting to anger mainstream investors and worry academics 
47yc0304 It\'s inconceivable that the directorate didn\'t know about Mr\. Rodriguez comments one international human rights worker who has studied the local refugee situation 
47yc0305 The people of El Barillo are under the boot 
47yc0306 They\'ve been smart enough to survive 
47yc0307 They\'ve adapted 
47yc0308 The new tax law\'s limits on retirement benefits for executives spur greater interest in certain trusts that help safeguard deferred compensation until t- retirement time 
47yc0309 Such trusts aren\'t completely inviolate creditors can claim the money after a bankruptcy for instance 
47yc030a But they are considered better than a mere promise to the executive 
47yc030b The drug azidothymidine or A\. Z\. T\. is the first prescription drug for acquired immune deficiency syndrome to get federal Food and Drug Administration approval 
47yc030c A\. Z\. T\. is marketed under the name Retrovir by Burroughs Wellcome Company at an annual retail dosage cost of about ten thousand dollars 
47yc030d It also is the most expensive prescription drug prompting fears that some insurers who normally provide prescription drug coverage will balk at its price 
47yc030e Now the issue is in the House\'s lap 
47yc030f The temporary ban on new banking powers is a provision in the Senate version of a bill to recapitalize the insolvent Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp\. 
47yc030g The House F\. S\. L\. I\. C\. measure doesn\'t have any other provisions 
47yc030h In addition by consenting to Rorer\'s bid Robins may have put itself up for sale 
47yc030i The whole thing could still deteriorate into an auction said a lawyer who was involved in the Manville Corporation bankruptcy law case 
47yc030j Other bidders could come in 
47yc030k Californians were asked how the state should get rid of its hefty budget surplus now estimated at one \.POINT one billion dollars 
47yc030l By a two to one margin registered Democrats surveyed by the Field Institute favored giving the money to public schools 
47yc030m But the state constitution may require the money to be returned directly to taxpayers 
47yc030n That appears more in line with Republican thinking 
47yc030o Republicans asked how to disburse the surplus split fifty fifty between schools and personal tax rebates 
47yc030p Harry Truman whistle stopped the country in nineteen forty eight campaigning against a parochial do nothing Congress that would not enact his legislative program 
47yc030q He struck a chord in the American people not only winning a stunning upset but also defeating scores of Republican congressmen in the process 
47yc030r Truman recognized that a presidential contest is not just a race among candidates but also an opportunity to debate great issues such as the proper separation of powers 
47yc030s The contest then isn\'t ideological 
47yc030t It\'s character personality experience 
47yc030u It\'s cultural as much as anything else 
47yc030v President Reagan who was in Durham North Carolina was cautious about the Soviet offer 
47yc030w I\'m waiting to see what the conditions are he said 
47yc030x A senior administration official however called the Gorbachev statement a watershed event because it will increase expectations among Soviet people for withdrawal 
47yc030y Completion of the transaction which also requires approval by regulatory agencies and holders of other securities must be completed no later than November thirtieth under the agreement 
47yc030z If it doesn\'t close as expected by September thirtieth the cash price paid by Nova for each Polysar common share would rise ten Canadian cents 
47yc0310 The cash price would rise fifteen more cents to fourteen dollars and seventy five cents Canadian a share if the transaction closes in November the sides said 
47yc0311 Transamerica said its consumer lending business achieved record results in the quarter with consumer loans secured by real estate growing to two \.POINT five billion dollars 
47yc0312 Its leasing business also posted record results 
47yc0313 Demand for standard containers was high because of strong world trade Transamerica said 
47yc0314 However the San Francisco based company said its real estate operations reported lower earnings 
47yc0315 That leaves the option of a military strike at terrorists or their bases which are mainly in Lebanon\'s Bekaa Valley an area under Syrian control 
47yc0316 U\. S\. intelligence agencies have identified as potential targets there buildings known to have been used by Hezbollah forces and their mentors the Iranian Revolutionary Guards 
47yc0317 But they aren\'t certain which factions use which buildings or when they are present 
47yc0318 Quite possibly a recent profit sharing bonus helped 
47yc0319 We don\'t have an elegant formula says Mr\. Barron 
47yc031a We said we think everyone\'s entitled to a share so here\'s a check 
47yc031b Next year if we do well there may be a bigger check 
47yc031c Is this any way to run a railroad 
47yc031d Could be 
47yc031e Consumers may also be worried about whether auto makers will continue the generous incentives they\'ve used almost continuously over the past year to buoy sales 
47yc031f [tongue_click] What\'s happening here is the good old buy in advance syndrome said John Qualls of Micro Economics Limited in Saint Louis 
47yc031g Mr\. Qualls expects sales to sag badly in the fourth quarter causing supplies of unsold vehicles to rise unless auto makers show continued restraint in production 
47yc0401 The Iranian crisis and the administration\'s uncertain grip on it has reawakened this cynicism 
47yc0402 The polls show much of the public does not [<misc_noise] believe the president when he denies knowing that profits from Iranian arms sales had been used to aid the Contras 
47yc0403 On this the matter is likely to turn 
47yc0404 Not on whether the shipments were a good *idea* or on whether lawyers can find some law that has been broken 
47yc0405 But on whether President Reagan told the truth when he denied knowing 
47yc0406 Interco said that because of the definitive agreement its Interco Subsidiary Incorporated unit terminated its tender offer for all Lane common shares at fifty five dollars a share 
47yc0407 The offer was set to expire Monday 
47yc0408 Any shares tendered to Interco under the offer will be returned to Lane shareholders Interco said 
47yc0409 Nevertheless First Options still lets customers such as James F\. Hart trade in naked out of the money puts and calls 
47yc040a Mr\. Hart says First Options hasn\'t sought to rein him in 
47yc040b Other brokerage firms however have curbed or halted unhedged options trading since the crash 
47yc040c Pet owners often call a pet psychic because a pet is sick and they want a detailed account of how it\'s feeling 
47yc040d And some pet psychics claim they can chat with pets from a distance 
47yc040e For example Gay Travers a former publicist called pet psychic Penelope Smith when her cat Sebastian was very ill 
47yc040f Ms\. Smith told her to hang up while the psychic talked to Sebastian 
47yc040g Three minutes later she called back with some bad news 
47yc040h Does that mean a cabinet post 
47yc040i Yeah said Mr\. Iacocca 
47yc040j Maybe 
47yc040k More likely though Mr\. Iacocca would prefer to be part of an informal group of presidential advisers 
47yc040l Earlier this year the sixty three year old executive signed a new four year contract with Chrysler 
47yc040m And in Tuesday\'s interview Mr\. Iacocca maintained that he wants to lead the company into the nineteen nineties 
47yc040n Neither the volunteer doctors nor the scientists conducting the experiment knew which volunteers were taking active aspirin and which were taking placebos 
47yc040o However a separate committee was set up to monitor the results of the experiment as it proceeded

47yc040q It\'s a welcome development in the face of very significant inventory overhang says Morgan Stanley\'s Mr\. Roach 
47yc040r A slowing of growth in production gives companies the ability to work off some inventory 
47yc040s [tongue_click] And economists note that the steady operating rate indicates continued strength in the manufacturing sector

47yc040z As for principal transactions Wall Street\'s euphemism for ha- trigger happy trading it\'s a bit harder to gauge the risks 
47yc0410 The firm is a big government bond trader and has grown a lot in foreign currency trading 
47yc0411 And among Morgan Stanley\'s biggest percentage gains in nineteen eighty seven was equity principal transactions which nearly tripled to two hundred and fifty nine million dollars in revenue 
47yc0412 It\'s pretty reasonable for people to take a dive on this one he says 
47yc0413 I\'m a little scared 
47yc0414 I don\'t blame people for not being heroes 
47yc0415 Jones Intercable also bought several systems serving twelve thousand subscribers in the southwestern Michigan area

47yc041d Kemper Financial Services\' David Hale refers to a soft takeoff 
47yc041e The latest data fuel Fed worries about reigniting inflation 
47zc0201 The delay is a victory albeit temporary for Mr\. Trump . who owns two Atlantic City casino hotels 
47zc0202 Bally\'s agreement to buy the Golden Nugget is widely perceived as an effort to scuttle a takeover attempt by Mr\. Trump 
47zc0203 Mr\. Trump\'s demand that the Golden Nugget purchase be blocked came as part of a countersuit he filed against Bally in December challenging a Bally financial restructuring plan 
47zc0204 Bally had earlier sued Mr\. Trump alleging various securities law violations 
47zc0205 The outlook in the Senate is still cloudy as long as President Reagan continues to oppose a tax boost 
47zc0206 Still Senate budget writers are including a significant revenue increase in their deficit reduction package 
47zc0207 [tongue_click] Such a budget item would force the Senate Finance Committee to come up with a tax increase of some kind

47zc0209 So our William eh- McGurn inquired into how many have been exported from Korea to Japan 
47zc020a He found that in nineteen eighty six the number was zero 
47zc020b This was down from nineteen eighty five when exports reached one sold to Mitsubishi 
47zc020c Exports lost to tougher competition abroad and more imports into the U\. S\. market . have caused many farmers to abandon their traditional faith in free trade 
47zc020d From sugar long protected [loud_breath] to wheat to flowers farmers are demanding that borders be closed 
47zc020e The losers particularly in sugar [loud_breath] are many of the Latin American countries whose desperate economies the U\. S\. government is otherwise trying to salvage

47zc020i The huge gap [loud_breath] to a large extent is a price phenomenon 
47zc020j The dollar\'s fall has pushed up the price of imports . causing the deficit to swell even as the volume of non oil imports has receded

47zc020y Mr\. Perot told Texas officials last month that his new company would bid against E\. D\. S\. . to process about eight hundred million dollars a year in Medicaid claims

47zc0213 They received payments in cash and in the form of clothes club memberships and payment of personal bills according to the charges 
47zc0214 N\. B\. C\.\'s T\. V\. coverage also gets its share of the blame 
47zc0215 Marketers say it was so bland and skipped so frequently from one event to another that there was little chance for excitement to build 
47zc0216 The constant commercial interruptions which led to ratings that were much lower than expected didn\'t help either 
47zc0217 The rehabilitation process is certainly further along

47zc030a [tongue_click] Floating fails when governments try to escape from the verdict of the exchange markets on their policies by resorting to direct controls over trade and capital flows 
47zc030b Because this latter threat is now so severe the world is right to talk about international monetary reform . if only as a delaying game 
47zc030c But idealistic talk should not deceive stabilizing exchange rates requires dependence and sub:ordination not the freedom for everybody to do their own thing 
47zc030d There\'s been a complete turnaround in short term sentiment said Thomas G\. Gribbon a senior vice president at Nomura Securities International Incorporated 
47zc030e For weeks people have been trading bearishly on dollar weakness and a rise in the C\. R\. B\. index

47zc030n Western analysts have long believed that Pakistan is at least close to possessing the necessary materials and knowledge to build and test a bomb 
47zc030o The country has refused to sign the nuclear non proliferation treaty . unless rival India which exploded its first nuclear device in nineteen seventy four does so 
47zc030p Pakistan has proposed various non proliferation controls on its program but only if India agrees to the same controls

47zc030x His inability to recover from October\'s market plunge was traced to a hostile bid from two rival financiers . for Bell Resources Limited which is controlled by Bell Group 
47zc030y The bid forced Mr\. Holmes a Court to call off a proposed merger of the Bell companies 
47zc030z That was the turning point said Darryl Smalley a director at the Perth brokerage Hartley Poynton Limited 
47zc0310 Frankfurt share prices retreated across the board in moderately active trading . as the day earlier decline on Wall Street and weaker dollar prompted widespread profit taking 
47zc0311 But equities recovered some of their earlier losses late in the session and most prices closed only slightly lower 
47zc0312 The market\'s bullish momentum is still intact traders said citing a flurry of late buy orders 
47zc0313 At the center of the controversy is a proposed sixth nuclear plant near Basel . at Kaiseraugst . a former Roman *settlement* . on the Rhine 
47zc0314 In March a group of parliamentarians . who had strongly supported the facility astonished the country by proposing the government abandon it 
47zc0315 Some one \.POINT two billion Swiss francs . eight hundred and thirty four \.POINT two million dollars . had already been spent on the project 
47zc0316 What bothers these people is not that Mrs\. Thatcher poses a danger to the so called unified European market 
47zc0317 Mrs\. Thatcher is not opposed to this 
47zc0318 Britain\'s own markets are more open than those of most European countries London is way ahead of them on capital movement having abolished exchange controls altogether 
47zc0319 The cause of the outrage is that European unity is the device through which the regulators and socialists hope to expand their grip on the Continent 
47zc031a Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value 
47zc031b Thus higher bidding narrows the investor\'s return while lower bidding widens it 
47zc031c The percentage rates are calculated on a three hundred and sixty day year . while the coupon equivalent yield [loud_breath] is based on a three hundred and sixty five day year 
47zc0401 Last year sponsors of a strong acid rain bill . claimed to have a tentative one vote majority on the committee in favor of their bill

47zc040c Teleport said that about a year ago it asked New York\'s Telephone to allow it to place their equipment in the central office 
47zc040d There Teleport\'s gear would pick up outgoing long distance phone calls that come into New York Telephone\'s switches from local telephone users 
47zc040e The equipment would then process and route calls made by Teleport\'s customers . directly to the long distance carriers for transmission

480c020i A source close to Texaco said that while Texaco is anxious to emerge from Chapter eleven it isn\'t the company\'s or shareholders\' interest to rush into th- a settlement 
480c020j It\'s normal for creditors to want a quick settlement

480c0219 In Connecticut\'s Senate race traditional politics is turned upside down

480c0305 The Corintio mining h- held an assembly of U\. S\. security objective curtailing the *shipment* of Soviet bloc arms to Central America through the communist government of Nicaragua 
480c0306 The existence of the operation leaked out and once exposed details flowed freely from Congress 
480c0307 The activity ended 
480c0308 The example is not unique 
480c0309 Opponents of covert activity have discovered that by leaking covert operations into the news they can create debilitating aura of suspicion and illegitimacy around foreign policies they dislike 
480c030a The companies\' sharp improve m- results provided more evidence of a rebound in both <the> sh- the chip and personal computer industries

480c030f Now the Savings and Loan holding company is the main business with down sized real estate syndication 
480c030g Core earnings are very consistent 
480c030h Since the presidential and congressional campaigns will dominate national attention next year there will be relatively little focus on state races 
480c030i Partially to avoid overtly inserting presidential politics into state politics many states have changed the date of their <start> statehouse elections <off> to off years

480c0316 The DAX index dropped five \.POINT forty nine to: . one thousand two hundred eighty nine . \.POINT seventy two 
480c0317 After opening broadly higher the tide turned at midday when the dollar\'s slide to a three month low began to worry market participants 
480c0318 To fight while remarkable for its bitterness typifies the core problem . of the nationwide push to contain medical costs Who gets less 
480c0319 Doctors want to maintain their authority and their incomes 
480c031a Hospitals are fighting to hang onto revenue more than a third of which comes from Medicare 
480c031b And patients don\'t want to see services decreased

480c0405 Before Friday it seemed that only an unexpected break in Delaware\'s court case could have extracted Henleys from a dilemma it now faces 
480c0406 Thus the case <would> cl- was closely watched 
480c0407 But it also raised important issues of corporate law 
480c0408 The most important of these was . contention that Santa Fe\'s board a:cted illegally December when it lowered the threshhold for a shareholder\'s rights plans to twenty \%PERCENT 
480c0409 Previously the right or poison pill was triggered automatically only if fifty \%PERCENT of the stocks were in hostile hands 
480c040a S\. D\. I\. despite what the Defense Luddites say is not an adventure in technology application 
480c040b It is a tool of national policy and as with any tool it is supposed to be used with a specific objective in mind 
480c040c The *objective* lest we forget it is to prevent a global nuclear war 
480c040d His *inability* to recover from October\'s market plunge was traced to a hostile bid [loud_breath] from two rival financiers of Bell Resources Limited which is controlled by the Bell Group 
480c040e The bid forced Mr\. Holmes a Court . to call off a proposed merger to the Bell companies 
480c040f That was the turning point said Darryl Smalley a director at the Perth brokerage Hartley *Poynton* Limited 
480c040g Finally there\'s the welfare problem 
480c040h Not all workers are as lucky as Joseph 
480c040i Some get sick or injured or lose their jobs 
480c040j Others who turned their life savings over to brokers in order to get help here discovered that promises of money meals and lodgings were bogus 
480c040k Fear of deportation prevents them from going to the police or help 
480c040l There are unconfirmed reports of workers starving to death here 
480c040m But some argue Agenda would be a big hit and create new category of software

480c040q He says he uses Agenda more than any other software 
480c040r Imperial says it has terrific unsolicited interest in the material from all areas of plastic uses 
480c040s But the cost of manufacturing the natural plastic is prohibitively expensive a fifteen dollar a pound compared with roughly sixty five per- cents a pound for conventional plastic 
480c040t However the company says it hopes to reduce manufacturing costs enough to begin marketing the plastic in two to five years 
480c040u Mr\. Hefter of Jefferies says that investors are basically picking some stocks in which they have situations going that they have a de- definite idea about 
480c040v But in general the wait se- and see attitude is still very *prevalent* out there 
480c040w There is no real pressure to jump into the market right now 
480c040x Mr\. Bethell has an eye for the fashionable and the *abominable* which today are often the same thing 
480c040y He obviously relishes a good fight and saying no to *cultural* barbarians and the current wisdom 
480c040z He uses pig bladder hammer and tongs and a scalpel as he is adept with them all as The Electric Windmill shows 
480c0410 The big attraction is that nineteen eighty eight Summer Olympics aren\'t really being held <this> in the summer 
480c0411 G\. M\. which has lost about eight \%PERCENT of the U\. S\. car market <is> re- in recent years figures the games\' late September timing is ideal 
480c0412 It also hopes the games will attract upscale viewers who normally don\'t tune into sports 
480c0413 During that campaign as in earlier ones few low and middle class ranking officials were arrested or dismissed 
480c0414 But no leading cadres or their family members were punished fueling cynicism among the masses 
480c0415 And the corruption problem seemed only to get worse 
480c0416 Getting the deal right is the key 
480c0417 Unlike warrants on Japanese stocks deals for U\. S\. companies aren\'t really covered by the ownership of underlying shares 
480c0418 Instead underwriters use what they call dynamic hedge 
480c0419 Each is different but usually involves a combination of stock option purchases arranged by the home office in New York 
480c041a Some of that cash has been used for bonus payments 
480c041b Wages and bonuses rose nineteen \%PERCENT in the first half a rate that far outpaces economic growth and ex:erted upward pressure on prices 
480c041c China\'s *economy* grew at an annual rate of five \.POINT seven <in> \%PERCENT in the first six months roughly half the average annual rate in the past decade 
481c0201 Wickes had made its friendly offer for Lear Siegler to help its Santa Monica neighbor ward off A\. F\. G\. Partners\' initial takeover bid last month 
481c0202 But Wickes which had signed an agreement to acquire Lear for one \.POINT seven billion dollars backed off after having problems arranging financing on satisfactory terms 
481c0203 Wickes has declined comment since saying that it was officially continuing efforts to arrange financing but wasn\'t optimistic about its chances 
481c0204 [tongue_click] The administration has occasionally mouthed complaints about the Private Express Statutes [loud_breath] the laws that prohibit free choice in mail service but has done little aside from talk 
481c0205 The White House intervened earlier last year to stop the Postal Service from banning private companies from shipping bundles of letters overseas to be posited directly in foreign mail systems 
481c0206 But this was fairly minor 
481c0207 The government civil suit alleged that a defect could cause the rear brakes to lock sending the car spinning out of control 
481c0208 G\. M\. which no longer makes X\. cars denied that the brakes are defective 
481c0209 Agreeing with G\. M\. Judge Jackson ruled that the government came to court with nothing more essentially than a reasonable suspicion that a defect existed 
481c020a By now there is little else Mr\. Falcigno can do to hype attendance

481c0212 However conventional film will be marginally profitable at best for Polaroid because initially Polaroid won\'t be manufacturing the film contends Elliott Novak an industry consultant 
481c0213 Instead it will buy the film from another company and put its name on it just as it does with videotape 
481c0214 Since it began selling videotape a few years ago Polaroid has built up an impressive twelve \%PERCENT market share making it the leader in the U\. S\. 
481c0215 But fierce competition has kept videotape profits slim and the conventional film business isn\'t likely to prove any bonanza either

481c0305 The bulls argue however that sellers are leaving the party too soon 
481c0306 For one thing they say the large premium increases of the past few years have only begun to appear in insurers\' bottom lines 
481c0307 For nineteen eighty seven earning gains of twenty five \%PERCENT to more than fifty \%PERCENT from nineteen eighty six levels are almost a certainty at these companies

482c020s Passage of the Kennedy Markey bill or similar grants of moral rights would enrich established artists at the expense of their struggling competitors

482c040n The point a point Mr\. Campbell keeps returning to is that every religion is true 
482c040o It\'s true as a metaphor for the human and cosmic mysteries

482c040q [tongue_click] Mr\. Howard not only helped the fledgling public companies drum up interest in their shares he helped invest the capital they raised in the public offerings 
482c040r In many cases the banks he advised invested large amounts in each other 
482c040s And they lent funds to other clients of Mr\. Howard who sometimes invested in the same stocks 
482c040t [tongue_click] Acquired in nineteen seventy nine Friendly reported modest growth until last year when labor shortages and lower customer traffic hurt the chain 
482c040u The unit improved sales with higher prices new store openings and the acquisition of two small restaurant chains during the second half of nineteen eighty six

482c0410 [loud_breath] We\'ve always wondered how to square Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega\'s rough words with his soft treatment in the Democratic controlled U\. S\. Congress 
482c0411 Maybe he has too because he\'s upped the ante 
482c0412 He has now branded not only the Republicans but also the Democrats as imperialists because both parties have talked recently about helping the Contras 
482c0413 What do the Democrats become if they actually vote the bandages 
482c0414 The Treasury is scheduled to announce details of its quarterly financing operation November second 
482c0415 [other_mouth_sound] It usually consists of three year notes ten year notes and thirty year bonds 
482c0416 But the department is very close to reaching its limits on issuing long term debt and thus has asked Congress to increase its authority 
482c0417 Congress still hasn\'t completed work on the issue which is part of the tax bill passed late Tuesday by the Senate 
482c0418 [tongue_click] Clarke Swanson noting that nineteen million women had stayed in the work force after World War two thought they could use help in whipping up a quick meals

483c0201 First of all the policy conservatives will pursue their unfinished agenda of deregulation in areas [loud_breath] from financial service to regulation as a drag on U\. S\. international competitiveness 
483c0202 They say the administration missed its chance and allowed its deregulation campaign to be all but aborted by controversy over Anne [loud_breath] Gorsuch and Jim Watt 
483c0203 They think their *general* cause in this area . is overwhelming 
483c0204 They will give it a new application and carry it to new forums

483c0209 Mr\. Gittis said the lawsuits would have little influence on the response of Revlon\'s board to the new tender offer 
483c020a He said MacAndrews and Forbes rather than Revlon is borrowing the money needed <to> to acquire Revlon and take it private 
483c020b We\'re selling eight hundred million of notes in a form of private placement he said

483c020d Still Mr\. Josephs and others think the changes will be good for the farm economy in general 
483c020e Many of these gentlemen farmers were tax motivated not profit motivated he said -s

483c020h The owner and operator of eighty two hundred seven Eleven stores repeatedly has said it didn\'t know the reasons for the heavy trading in its stock

483c020u BankAmerica is now writing off fewer of its problem loans than most other large banks 
483c020v The development has left some analysts wondering whe(ther)- the bank is being aggressive e- enough especially consider its record of surprising loan problems over the l- past three years 
483c020w But bank officials say they are being prudent 
483c020x They said lower write offs reflect previous housecleaning as well as more conservative lending practices 
483c020y In addition the bank has had a beefed up team of specialists who are having increasing success in recovering previously written off loans 
483c020z The only new issue priced yesterday was five hundred and fifty million of twelve year senior subordinate debentures from U\. S\. G\. Corporation

483c0211 The offering is part of . U\. S\. G\.\'s recapitalization plan 
483c0212 Mr\. Zehnder plays down his criticism 
483c0213 He points to the fact that Credit Suisse . leads in all number of publicly listed bonds launched but lags in the number of other l- unlisted notes it issued 
483c0214 This is significant he said because bond issues pay higher commissions than unlisted notes 
483c0215 [tongue_click] In contrast Senator Bentsen campaigned last week in a half empty plane to a measured cadence 
483c0216 He portrays Governor Dukakis as a pragmatic can do executive 
483c0217 He offers himself a business orient Senate Finance Committee chairman and former insurance executive as evidence of that moderation 
483c0218 The reassuring words of his speeches are the words of the boardroom . Competence hand on management enhanced recovery 
483c0219 Mr\. Kidder insists there is a cause for hope 
483c021a Good teachers put snags in the river of children passing by and over the years they redirect hundreds of lives 
483c021b Perhaps he is right 
483c021c But what he notices at the fifth grade science fair seems more significant 
483c021d The results of that painful charade don\'t reflect social status ethnic background or teaching technique They reflect the contributions of each child\'s parents 
483c021e Aviation insurance is under intense pressure 
483c021f The global airline premiums have dropped to about four hundred million from about one billion in nineteen eighty seven 
483c021g Meanwhile airline losses in nineteen eighty eight rose significantly from the previous year 
483c0301 The economic fallout shouldn\'t be ignored however 
483c0302 A provision in the spending bill requires that at least one third of the repair and overhead work on ships be done locally at their home ports 
483c0303 That makes it a big deal for Todd and Lockheed Mr\. Dicks said referring to two Puget Sound shipyards 
483c0304 The government civil suit alleged that a defect could cause the rear hand brakes to lock sending the car spinning out of control 
483c0305 G\. M\. which no longer makes X\. cars denied the brakes are defective

483c0307 Inco\'s stock has caught technical analysts\' attention too 
483c0308 [throat_clear] It recently broke out of a five year trading range says Martin Pring editor of Pring Market Review 
483c0309 [tongue_click] He thinks the stock could be poised for big gains reflecting what may be a bull market in base metals 
483c030a [tongue_click] Rent control . is as bad as the income tax deduction for home ownership 
483c030b All the beneficiaries of the deduction are high income earners not simply some of them 
483c030c It leads to extra large swimming pools extra bedrooms in Beverly Hills but no housing for people who need it most 
483c030d Still when this issue was last voted in Congress eighty five out of the eighty five senators present voted for it 
483c030e The only surprising thing given the number of beneficiaries is that somehow the other fifteen senators didn\'t manage to get their names on the roll call 
483c030f Mr\. Zinn said Entertainment Marketing is still weighing a proxy fight

483c030i [tongue_click] Under the plan the Edelman group will contribute about a hundred million in equity to the transaction

483c030w [tongue_click] The king\'s request left the delegates in a tight spot 
483c030x [loud_breath] To ignore Jordan and make a substantial formal cash pledge to the P\. L\. O\. would signal a shift away from moderation difficult for the gulf states to *countenance*

483c030z But other evidence on the flap is conflicting 
483c0310 One of the crew members can be heard on the cockpit voice recorder calling out Flaps fifteen fifteen the correct position for the flaps

483c0313 While the e- estimated revenue of almost a hundred million dollars over three years is relatively small provision might be perceived as a anti takeover push by Congress

483c0315 To be sure the deficit has declined in the last few years 
483c0316 But that decline is entirely result of rising surplus in the Social Security trust fund 
483c0317 That money should be invested to help defray the future retirement costs of the baby boomers instead it is being used to paper over the deficit 
483c0318 That\'s yet another symptom of Mr\. Dansforth\'s nationwide now now isms

483c0402 In narrowly drawn statement vice chairman Herbert Freiman denied Shearson had offered a block of Salomon Brothers [loud_breath] which managed the selling brokers\' floor o- operations 
483c0403 Mr\. *Freiman* wouldn\'t elaborate 
483c0404 That may be but there are not enough tough calls 
483c0405 Emotional upsets headaches backaches and other subjective symptoms are hard to . quantify 
483c0406 Besides someone who truly feels disabled may as a result actually be disabled 
483c0407 A well timed period of time off with stress reduction and an effort to better understanding may prevent a much worse disability later 
483c0408 It may also uncover factors in the marketplace that can be improved

484c0208 Westinghouse officials told analysts that operating profit in the Industries Group fell fifteen to twenty \%PERCENT hurt in part by weak results in Canadian operations 
484c0209 [tongue_click] A sharp drop in operating profit from the Broadcasting Group\'s production company contributed to the slightly lower operating earnings overall for that segment

484c020n [tongue_click] Some parts of Texas the Dallas Fort 
484c020o Worth area for example haven\'t had anything that legitimately could be called a recession 
484c020p The main reason so many lenders are in trouble is an old fashioned failing among bankers a weakness for real estate speculation 
484c020q As a result the government is talking of higher farm prices 
484c020r But higher farm prices would add to an already steep inflation rate

484c0304 In the past Filipinos in many rural areas preferred the disciplined terror of the N\. P\. A\. to the random excesses of the country\'s military 
484c0305 With the change of government last year a mild improvement in military behavior and the detection of the Mindanao slaughters some Filipinos are changing their minds 
484c0306 Diplomats and political analysts say they don\'t know if the trend presages significant popular resistance to the Communists or just additional turmoil in the Philippine countryside 
484c0307 There is a wide variation in thinking about how sick one is and how important time off is in order to get well

484c030u Topeka said it intends to exercise the option 
484c030v The biggest hurdle was to find the funds to meet the cost of reconstruction inclusive of the issue of stamps 
484c030w However the response to the government\'s international appeal for assistance has been extremely heartwarming 
484c030x The funds required for public sector assistance have been realized and the further amount required is expected to flow from the proceeds of overseas reinsurance of property damage 
484c030y To begin with companies have been doing a good job of managing inventories 
484c030z In the past businesses have tended to become increasingly optimistic as expansions persisted 
484c0310 When sales eventually slowed inventories quickly reached excessive levels 
484c0311 Companies thereupon cut their buying industrial production declined and a recession was under way 
484c0312 Thirty one teams of nineteen representing businesses schools and assorted other groups signed up for the first local competition

484c0315 These mixed feelings of frustration with and gratitude toward the authorities are part of the everyday life of a foreigner doing business in Korea 
484c0316 [tongue_click] In fact such contradictions are what seem to make the Korean world go round 
484c0317 A Western businessman needs to be ready for them 
484c0318 Here are a few hard learned facts of Korean business life 
484c0319 But many local businesses that depend on tourism aren\'t convinced 
484c031a They argue that a commercial mine might get played out in a few years 
484c031b And they fear that many tourists who trek here for the tantalizing prospect of finding a diamond in the field will take their vacations elsewhere 
484c0401 The court was split on both the Williams Act and commerce clause 
484c0402 Justice Lewis Powell acknowledged that the nineteen eighty two case of Edgar V\. 
484c0403 MITE suggested that any state law that favored targets more than did the Williams Act would be invalid because Congress had preempted local regulations 
484c0404 The court backtracked here to say state laws might be O\. K\. if they help the Williams Act\'s purpose by heaping even more burdens on acquirers 
484c0405 It has relieved at least some of the frustration felt by the farmers says Peter Brent a member of a farm activist group

484c040c L\. T\. V\. has said repeatedly since its filing that it would fight any creditor move to either reorganize the unit separately or force its sale 
484c040d Creditors on the other hand have discussed the idea almost since the days of L\. T\. V\.\'s filing 
484c040e And the pension agency the banks and the committee representing unsecured creditors have recently been holding serious discussions on the issue 
484c040f [tongue_click] In reaction to the news interest rates plunged the Australian dollar firmed and analysts predicted stocks would move higher 
484c040g But while the budget gave a boost to the markets it also presaged greater austerity for the nation as a whole 
484c040h To Mr\. Hawke that is as it should be 
484c040i Australians have got to recognize that we aren\'t out of the woods yet he says

484c040u We think the business holds considerable promise for the future she adds and we think Citicorp is a capable organization 
484c040v Others say institutional asset management still is considered a good business despite relatively low fees and signs of slowing growth 
484c040w First Boston and Xerox had no comment 
484c040x The chief operating officer would have both the footwear and apparel businesses reporting to him

484c0410 Farm futures prices have fallen several times in the past two weeks following several weeks of a drought inspired rally 
484c0411 Yesterday\'s trading seemed to support the notion among some analysts that corn and wheat futures are top heavy 
484c0412 The market has been overdone significantly on the upside said Richard Loewy senior grain and oil seed analyst with Prudential Bache Securities Incorporated 
484c0413 The piper has to be paid on the other side 
484c0414 One of the four businesses included in the lockup option granted to K\. K\. R\. is Macmillan\'s directory division which consists of Who\'s Who and National Register Publishing 
484c0415 Thus it wasn\'t immediately clear why International Thomson might be looking at the operation even though it is included in the lockup option

484c041b Economic cooperation was advanced with businessmen signing agreements for about thirty contracts and several joint ventures 
484c041c Human rights too may have taken a step forward if Mr\. Gorbachev lives up to his promise to release all political prisoners by year\'s end 
484c041d In early nineteen eighty eight the political settlement envisaged by the non communists seemed plausible 
484c041e Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev was a major reason 
484c041f Mr\. Gorbachev saw the expansionist ambitions of his predecessors stymied by the resolute containment policy of both China and the pro Western ASEAN powers 
484c041g Support for the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia cost the Soviet Union economically and diplomatically 
484c041h [tongue_click] So the Soviets trying to eliminate the military quagmire in Cambodia persuaded Hanoi\'s leaders to negotiate a military withdrawal from Cambodia

485c0207 Closely held TransAmerican said it also agreed to settle a dispute with another creditor Medallion Oil Company 
485c0208 The proposed settlements which must be approved by the bankruptcy court would remove two major hurdles in TransAmerican\'s long struggle to get out of Chapter eleven proceedings

485c020a [loud_breath] I received welfare for eight months after my second child was born 
485c020b Luckily I was able with the help of my family to get a good job and reliable child care 
485c020c But there are a lot of welfare mothers out there who aren\'t this fortunate 
485c020d A lot of women don\'t know how to get jobs or the training needed to get one and someone to watch their children 
485c020e When that situation is resolved then you will see a lot of former welfare recipients becoming productive members of society 
485c020f The Sun Belt forecast partly cloudy

485c020v CalMat would be re- !rid of Mr\. Brierley who appears to have tried to put the company in play 
485c020w Industrial Equity executives in California didn\'t return calls seeking comment 
485c020x Mr\. Chatichai\'s wealthy family background and his family\'s large property interests give him a good understanding of the business community

485c0210 However conventional film will be marginally profitable at best for Polaroid because initially Polaroid won\'t be manufacturing the film contends Elliott Novak an industry consultant 
485c0211 Instead it will buy the film from another company and put its name on it just as it does with videotape 
485c0212 Since it began selling videotape a few years ago Polaroid has built up an impressive twelve \%PERCENT market share making it the leader in the U\. S\. 
485c0213 But fierce competition has kept videotape profits slim and the conventional film business isn\'t likely to prove any bonanza either 
485c0214 Peter DaPuzzo head of retail trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton also looks for a sharp upward move in stock prices given a few ifs 
485c0215 One is if investors don\'t get spooked at the anniversary of the crash 
485c0216 Another is if the Federal Reserve eases interest rates 
485c0217 And a third is if George Bush wins the presidential election

485c0304 The new tax law\'s limits on retirement benefits for executives spur greater interest in certain trusts that help safeguard deferred compensation until retirement time 
485c0305 Such trusts aren\'t completely inviolate creditors can claim the money after a bankruptcy for instance 
485c0306 But they are considered better than a mere promise to the executive

485c030d There\'s some paper out for bids you haven\'t heard about Cadwallader because you do only domestic 
485c030e Colombian government bonds with the coupon indexed to the street price of cocaine 
485c030f Solid investment but intriguing 
485c030g I think we\'re going to spring for that 
485c030h With a rebound in the stock market investors\' fears about a recession cooled and the bond market slumped 
485c030i A sharp slide in the U\. S\. dollar also added some downward pressure to bond prices

485c030m It was the Big Board\'s most active issue 
485c030n Until now Nasdaq or the N\. A\. S\. D\.\'s automated quotation system has provided computer terminals with price quotations on all issues 
485c030o Most big trades however are negotiated by telephone and then recorded into the system\'s computers 
485c030p Only the small order system has provided traders with the ability to execute trades by computer rather than by telephone 
485c030q Still company insiders said the restructuring was entirely Mr\. Akers\'s plans and wasn\'t forced on him by the I\. B\. M\. board 
485c030r A director said the board learned of the plan at its meeting last Tuesday 
485c030s John found everything was coming onto his desk and he had more than he could cope with another director said 
485c030t He wanted an organization which resolved more problems before they got to him 
485c030u The E\. P\. A\. proposed minimum standards <for> for municipal trash dumps that the agency estimated will cost eight hundred and eighty seven million a year

485c030x Hoping to prevent long costly disputes over what documents defendants have to surrender judges grant blanket protective orders 
485c030y The orders typically bar public dissemination of records and dep- depositions even after a settlement or verdict 
485c030z Plaintiffs\' lawyers generally haven\'t balked at this as long as they can get the information they need to prepare for their trials 
485c0310 Random House a subsidiary of the Newhouse family\'s Advance Publications Incorporated said the move will take it out of the textbook publishing business

485c0314 A\. Yes without question 
485c0315 It\'s my sense that there was a time when people thought they could trade on inside information with absolute impunity 
485c0316 And that\'s no longer true 
485c0317 Now I am certain that there are still people who think they can trade on inside information and get away with it because they\'re smarter than the average person 
485c0318 There will always be those people 
485c0319 But I think that the actions have had a *significant* effect on conduct 
485c031a This growing reliance on third parties to sell products could hinder Hewlett Packard\'s ability to manage its business and make the company\'s stock less attractive to investors

485c0406 Trading volume has been lethargic for the past few weeks partly reflecting confusion about the economic outlook 
485c0407 *Important* clues are expected to emerge Friday when the Labor Department reports employment figures for February 
485c0408 Many analysts expect the statistics to indicate that the economy remains weak and that lower interest rates lie ahead 
485c0409 But the employment statistics are very difficult to predict and individual estimates vary widely 
485c040a But some industry analysts are skeptical about S\. H\. V\.\'s intentions

485c040w No final budget decisions have been made at the White House 
485c040x Budget drafting is behind schedule and federal agencies won\'t even see O\. M\. B\. re- recommendations until late this week 
485c040y But it\'s already clear that the administration has increased its emphasis on education 
485c040z I think it\'s a perfectly honorable profession 
485c0410 If more of us did it the opportunities would get smaller because more firms would be competing to close the same spreads he says

487c0412 He expects long term Treasury bond yields to hover around the eight and a half \%PERCENT level in the near future 
487c0413 Treasurys won\'t resume trading until the Tokyo market opens Monday 
487c0414 This some analysts say may mean . that the London market reaction will be confined to a brief adjustment at the opening

487c0416 If Vietnam does withdraw conditions might also become ripe for a high level summit between China and the Soviet Union 
487c0417 Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping has *repeatedly* said that Beijing and Moscow can\'t normalize relations until the Russian backed Vietnamese leave Cambodia

487c0419 The suit charges that Burger King only allows black franchisees to expand one store at a time while whites are allowed to *simultaneously* open multiple franchises 
487c041a Burger King also makes blacks wait three to four times longer than whites for approval of a new or expansion franchise the suit says 
487c041b The franchisees further allege that Burger King falsely and *fraudulently* misrepresented the sales potential of their stores 
488c0201 Alarmed by the burn throughs the F\. A\. A\. issued new rules requiring airlines to conduct frequent inspections of burner cans 
488c0202 The agency also prohibited the welding of can cracks longer than three inches

488c0208 All the gains that we are making are at the local level says F\. James McDonald G\. M\.\'s president 
488c0209 That may be the most important thing happening in heavy industry in the U\. S\. today 
488c020a Indeed the era of big time national labor talks in which union and management leaders butt heads over pennies an hour is waning 
488c020b Even less appreciated is the turmoil that often results for women 
488c020c When he started becoming impotent I had all kinds of worries and strange thoughts says Maggie a Boston woman who lives with her fiance 
488c020d I thought I was doing something wrong or that he didn\'t love me or that he was gay 
488c020e She says it was a wonderful relief when doctors traced his problem to nerve damage from back surgery and treated it with a muscle relaxing drug 
488c020f A convention would open the door to a whole new group of leaders 
488c020g An election to choose convention delegates would be like a special election to pick a new Congress 
488c020h Under legislation passed by the Senate a constitutional convention would be made up of one member elected from each congressional district and two at large from each state 
488c020i No current members of Congress could participate 
488c020j That test was less than a complete success 
488c020k Dirt that accumulated in the kenaf during harvesting wasn\'t all removed and ended up in the paper 
488c020l The kenaf also jammed in some equipment because it had been cut in lengths that were several feet long 
488c020m By September the weakness of coordinated international efforts to prevent dollar declines finally surfaced 
488c020n In response to increasing inflation fears Germany and Japan began tightening monetary policy and raising interest rates 
488c020o In untimely fashion Secretary Baker reaffirmed the administration\'s intent to prevent dollar declines 
488c020p In anticipation of the substantial Fed tightening that would be necessary to prevent dollar declines U\. S\. interest rates skyrocketed 
488c020q The seeds of market discontent were sown 
488c020r Pratt and Whitney said last week it might lay off employees after the first of the year because of decreased demand for jet engines and parts

488c0210 Special vehicles have been built to squire them around 
488c0211 Each dog needs a trainer

488c0215 If I schedule it the President would have some moral responsibility to help pass it he said 
488c0216 I don\'t want to run it out there and be defeated again 
488c0217 Mr\. Wright should be less timid in his convictions 
488c0218 After all he isn\'t the one who has to risk getting hit over the head with a metal pipe 
488c0219 A falling dollar is supposed to make U\. S\. imports more expensive decreasing demand for them 
488c021a But some foreign producers have been slow to adjust prices to reflect the decline in the dollar contributing to the persistent growth in U\. S\. imports 
488c021b In the past twelve months import prices have climbed seven \.POINT one \%PERCENT while the dollar has fallen nine \.POINT nine \%PERCENT 
488c021c Given the nature of our ownership it\'s obviously a very complex issue Mr\. Elish said 
488c021d There are a lot of things to consider and we\'re looking at it 
488c021e But nothing is imminent 
488c021f The deputy treasurer did it says Frank Keefe the governor\'s budget mastermind 
488c021g He obviously must be doing it because it is a prudent and professional thing to do 
488c021h As for himself Mr\. Keefe recently announced he\'s leaving his post in December 
488c021i By then the legislature which reconvenes today to pick up the budget mess will be playing what did the governor know and when did he know it 
488c0301 The word is terror 
488c0302 My fear of failure may be greater in some respects 
488c0303 People say adversity is good for you 
488c0304 Well that\'s not exactly true 
488c0305 I\'m not the same person I was 
488c0306 Transportation Department spending would fall six \%PERCENT or one \.POINT five eight billion dollars to twenty four \.POINT six three billion dollars 
488c0307 Amtrak subsidies would be eliminated and the passenger railroad\'s assets sold bringing in an estimated one billion dollars 
488c0308 But Congress is likely to balk and finding a buyer for the money losing railroad may be tough 
488c0309 The budget also would end discretionary grants for transit systems and close the Interstate Commerce Commission 
488c030a Congress has rejected similar cuts before 
488c030b Mr\. Funaro described as hot air and nonsense foreign bankers\' language in their s- criticism of Brazil\'s lack of economic policy 
488c030c He said nobody worried about Brazil\'s high inflation when the country was producing big surpluses to meet debt payments 
488c030d Instead of looking for excuses he said these banks should realize there\'s a debt crisis and it has to be resolved by both sides 
488c030e But the corpse was soon walking 
488c030f During the Progressive Era pressure for more federal spending developed 
488c030g In nineteen oh eight the Democratic platform backed a constitutional amendment that would allow Congress to impose a new tax directly on income 
488c030h In July nineteen oh nine Congress sent such an amendment to the states for ratification 
488c030i By early nineteen eighty six Kimberly Clark\'s resilience was being tested again 
488c030j P\. and G\. had beaten the company to the market with an extra thin diaper called Ultra Pampers 
488c030k Kimberly Clark possessed the necessary technology super absorbent polymers which replaced some of the bulky fluff and was even using it in its adult incontinence products 
488c030l But the company delayed its plans for thin baby diapers when research showed that parents didn\'t think diapers were absorbent unless they doubled the size of baby\'s bottom 
488c030m The spokesman also said the league\'s owners are committed to playing with their current replacement rosters for the rest of the season including the Super Bowl if necessary

488c030o He has said that the players will remain on strike for the duration if the union\'s offer was rejected 
488c030p Under terms of the original agreement Computer Memories would have issued new shares of its own in exchange for shares of closely held Hemdale

488c030r The surviving company would have been named Hemdale Film Corporation and John Daly Hemdale\'s current chairman would have become chief executive officer of the surviving company 
488c030s Stanley Nabi executive vice president of Bessemer said They\'re not reducing their offer if you calculate the offer\'s value as of Thursday\'s close 
488c030t I figure it was worth sixty five dollars and eighty five cents a share on Thursday 
488c030u With Friday\'s revision it\'s worth sixty eight dollars a share 
488c030v The revised terms are no less attractive than the original terms in the post crash market 
488c030w The Soviets obviously want to make it as difficult as possible for NATO to carry out its modernization said one Western diplomat in Bonn 
488c030x A senior NATO diplomat accused the Soviets of trying to seduce the Germans away from us 
488c030y It is none too subtle wedge driving he told Reuters 
488c030z The forecast is a bit rosier than that of most private analysts 
488c0310 In its latest survey Blue Chip Economic Indicators consensus forecast puts growth at one \.POINT eight \%PERCENT this year 
488c0311 More than three fourths of the economists polled expect a recession to start before the end of nineteen eighty nine 
488c0312 Turnout is another unknown factor 
488c0313 [tongue_click] To capitalize here Governor Dukakis would like to see a heavy turnout especially in such pockets of strength as the Chicago lakefront and suburbs 
488c0314 But that may not happen Illinois registration is below nineteen eighty four and no presidential candidate has yet caught fire 
488c0315 Shearson Lehman Hutton Incorporated\'s index of long term Treasury bonds fell five \.POINT six two points to one thousand two ninety nine \.POINT five seven

488c0408 He\'s analytically tough he\'ll never take a story at its face value says a trader 
488c0409 Mr\. McNay also is respected as a manager who makes decisions quickly 
488c040a If a story makes sense Joe will be the first to put in an order the trader adds 
488c040b He brings that attitude to the office 
488c040c The lunchroom in the sprawling company office building in this north Dallas suburb has a free ice cream machine and a ten cent Coke dispenser 
488c040d For Christmas last year he gave all seventy employees videocassette recorders and set up a free video library with one thousand five hundred movies

488c040n N\. F\. L\. teams reported thousands of requests for refunds and said they expected thousands more 
488c040o The biggest significance of the talks then may be hints for grappling with competitiveness 
488c040p These negotiations could be an important part of the answer to the question How are we going to achieve productivity growth says Mr\. Meyer 
488c040q What we\'re seeing is an attempt to get more flexibility from unions to allow cost reductions 
488c040r Mr\. Pardus declined to say how Eastern Utilities would try to acquire the remaining Neco shares 
488c040s Officials at Eastern and Neco said the two companies haven\'t yet met to discuss Eastern\'s intentions [misc_noise]

488c040x Canada Japan and West Germany require good will to be amortized against earnings 
488c040y However the good will charges are in large measure tax deductible which gives companies from these countries a cash flow advantage over a U\. S\. purchaser 
488c040z In effect the governments of Japan Germany and Canada provide a subsidy for the purchase of U\. S\. companies 
488c0410 The company doesn\'t expect to seek any additional financing in the near term Mr\. Wiggins said 
488c0411 Autodie has never paid a dividend and has no plans to start paying one he said

488c0417 The Philippines is of course a tough country to govern 
488c0418 It reflects credit on Mrs\. Aquino that she has stuck to her democratic principles through five coup attempts as well as nonstop political dogfights 
488c0419 Mrs\. Aquino s- understands correctly that as the elected president she is above such nonsense 
488c041a Her responsibility is to the voters who recognized the nation\'s desperate need for reform and gave her their mandate 
488c041b To avoid more outbursts such as Mr\. Laurel\'s it\'s time that Mrs\. Aquino started using that mandate 
488c041c Mr\. Lennane has started the bidding in June by proposing to take the company private for seven dollars and twenty five cents a share

489c020n Bleary eyed prosecutors stayed up until dawn several days in a row [loud_breath] drafting a flurry of proposed charges motions and other court filings requested by Mr\. Walsh 
489c020o The idea was to seek indictments quickly before Messrs\.

489c020z Metro Richelieu officials wouldn\'t comment on the possible sale of the Steinberg operation 
489c0210 Richard Sutton Provigo\'s treasurer said If and when it comes on the market we will definitely look at it 
489c0211 Regardless of how the foreign purchases begin they often involve the very parts that make weapons perform 
489c0212 For example F\. M\. C\. Corporation\'s Bradley Fighting Vehicle depends on a sophisticated sensor system from the Netherlands to inform soldiers of potential threats and targets

489c0217 [tongue_click] The G\. O\. P\. seems primed in other words for a replay of old values themes 
489c0218 But a paradox arises 
489c0219 [tongue_click] Mr\. Bush never was strongly identified with the social conservative wing of the party 
489c021a Mr\. Reagan himself when he got in office put its issues on the back burner 
489c021b His announced purpose will be to rally the party and give a boost to the candidacy of George Bush to succeed him 
489c021c This he undoubtedly will try to do for the politics of the Democrats\' Michael Dukakis is hardly in the Reagan mold 
489c021d But the president I dare predict will try to give Mr\. Bush a boost by speaking with pride of his own eight years in the White House 
489c021e But the fall of J\. Bildner is more than just another small business failure 
489c021f For one thing it\'s a spectacular small business failure 
489c021g While most young companies have so little capital that even the smallest misstep can kill them J\. Bildner was flush with cash 
489c021h So its mistakes and its lessons were magnified

489c0302 Nicholas Brady chairman of Dillon Read and Company said in Senate testimony last month that he is confused about what is permissible and what isn\'t

489c0304 When Hu Yaobang was dumped in January as the Communist Party\'s secretary general Mr\. Zhao was elevated to that post on an acting basis

48bc0304 [loud_breath] In addition to the war of nerves over discounts retail e- executives said this Christmas season has been characterized by the absence of a big hit in the toy department 
48bc0305 [tongue_click] But retailers have seen strong sales of big ticket items to well heeled customers 
48bc0306 They are buying to beat the new tax law which will end the deduction of sales tax and some interest expenses 
48bc0307 [tongue_click] Bally\'s drive into the hotel casino industry has made health clubs an increasingly awkward fit analysts said and thus [loud_breath] the most likely candidate for divestiture 
48bc0308 [tongue_click] By shedding the health club line Bally could focus on its remaining operations gambling machines state lotteries and amusement centers 
48bc0309 Analysts could also question the fit of the company\'s theme parks though [tongue_click] saying a sale of !that operation could follow 
48bc030a The new policy isn\'t clearly delineated 
48bc030b It stipulates that no new defense contract will be signed 
48bc030c But Mr\. Peres refused to respond to reporters\' questions on how long existing arms export contracts with South Africa will run 
48bc030d [tongue_click] Texaco filed for Chapter eleven protection citing the burden of its ten \.POINT three billion dollar legal battle with Pennzoil 
48bc030e The bankruptcy law case the largest in history came after both firms apparently r- . remained about two billion dollars apart in settlement talks 
48bc030f Though the filing complicates the battle most experts believe neither company will emerge the winner 
48bc030g The court was split on both the Williams Act and commerce clause 
48bc030h Justice Lewis Powell acknowledged <that> ni- that the nineteen eighty two case of Edgar versus 
48bc030i MITE suggested that any state law that favored targets more than did the Williams Act would be invalid because Congress had preempted local regulations 
48bc030j The court backtracked here to say the state laws might be O\. K\. if they help the Williams Act\'s purpose by heaping even more burdens on acquirers 
48bc030k [tongue_click] The system isn\'t a hundred \%PERCENT perfect but it\'s working reasonably well a Foreign Ministry official told reporters 
48bc030l The official said the U\. S\. has been similarly reassured 
48bc030m Even so the U\. S\. has indicated that it wants Japan to take better care of how Japanese technology is sold around the world 
48bc030n [tongue_click] Another incentive that food processors cite for getting into the restaurant business is the high cost of introducing new grocery items 
48bc030o Starting a new brand can easily cost General Mills more than twenty million dollars in development and promotion costs 
48bc030p [lip_smack] Of course the Olive Garden start up brick and mortar and all has cost five times that 
48bc030q Pratt and Whitney said last week it might lay off employees after the first of the year because of decreased demand for jet engines and parts 
48bc030r Company declined to discuss how many employees might be laid off [loud_breath] or <if> <the> wor(k)- if the loss would be permanent or temporary 
48bc030s [tongue_click] But union officials said the company had tossed around numbers from sixteen hundred to two thousand 
48bc030t As a result the government is talking of higher farm prices 
48bc030u [tongue_click] But higher farm prices would . add to an already steep inflation rate 
48bc030v So Beijing officials reportedly talk of tying wages to inflation an idea reminiscent of wage indexation . tried in some Latin American nations several years ago with disastrous results 
48bc030w [tongue_click] But U\. S\. manufacturers who took a beating during the first half of this decade continue to enjoy a roaring revival that began last year 
48bc030x As a result <there> <is> <a> there is growing evidence factory wage and price increases are accelerating 
48bc030y [tongue_click] And that could lead the Fed to boost interest rates in an effort to cool down the economy in the coming months 
48bc030z To be sure a few companies are trying to use the Olympics to make the transition from a subcontractor [loud_breath] to an internationally known brand 
48bc0310 Kukje Corporation shifted from producing Nike shoes to developing its own Pro Specs line of athletic shoes five years ago 
48bc0311 It paid four \.POINT five million dollars in cash and goods to be an official sponsor of the games and has been highlighting the logo in its advertising 
48bc0312 Kukje hopes the Olympics will help give Pro Specs a foothold in Europe 
48bc0313 [tongue_click] [loud_breath] The new emphasis on making schools work has pushed aside some other longstanding school debates 
48bc0314 Desegregation of public schools remains a goal but is entirely elusive in many areas 
48bc0315 Many families that could white or black fled to suburban private or parochial schools as busing alone became a more discussed issue than school curricula 
48bc0316 With a few exceptions such as Yonkers and Kansas City federal judges have learned to eschew their tragic social engineering 
48bc0317 [beep] Most now leave school systems alone to attract students back not drive them out 
48bc0318 [tongue_click] There is no evidence of recession like developments in these statistics said Norman Robinson . [tongue_click] chief economist at Mellon Bank Corporation 
48bc0319 As a result he said it\'s very difficult to believe that the Fed is going to ease at this time 
48bc031a Under these conditions the Fed will probably adopt a familiar wait and see attitude 
48bc031b Some of that cash has been used for bonus payments 
48bc031c Wages and bonuses rose nineteen \%PERCENT in the first half a rate that far outpaced economic growth and exerted upward pressure on prices 
48bc031d China\'s economy grew at an annual rate of five \.POINT seven \%PERCENT in the first six months roughly half the average annual rate in the past decade 
48bc0401 The report doesn\'t include President Reagan\'s own version of events 
48bc0402 Does the president have a version of the events 
48bc0403 I don\'t know if he does said Mr\. Mathes 
48bc0404 He said the White House was pleased that the report had been released because Mr\. Reagan wants to find out what happened 
48bc0405 Captain overhearing the radio discussion about runway five I understood nothing 
48bc0406 And what runway 
48bc0407 What are you talking about 
48bc0408 Last month\'s surge was widespread with auto sales rising one \.POINT nine \%PERCENT building materials one \.POINT two \%PERCENT and furniture climbing \.POINT seven \%PERCENT 
48bc0409 The only noticeable declines were in restaurants \.POINT six \%PERCENT and food stores \.POINT three \%PERCENT 
48bc040a Excluding autos sales rose \.POINT four \%PERCENT last month 
48bc040b [tongue_click] If we look at the record the debate should be rather short 
48bc040c The winners obvious 
48bc040d The only tragedy and it\'s an amazing one is that most Americans don\'t even know what has been accomplished and how it came about 
48bc040e Christians and Moslems marched across Beirut\'s sect- . sectarian demarcation line to protest Lebanon\'s economic crisis 
48bc040f About ten thousand people participated in the rally 
48bc040g Lebanon\'s currency has lost about eighty \%PERCENT against the value of the U\. S\. dollar this year and the inflation rate is estimated about three hundred \%PERCENT 
48bc040h People are concerned about inflation Mr\. Worseck continued 
48bc040i They are concerned whether the dollar will go into the tank again 
48bc040j I don\'t think people are overreacting 
48bc040k Chrysler is resuming exports to Europe after its financial problems in the late nineteen seventies forced it to leave the market 
48bc040l The company plans to ship versions of its Dodge Shadow Dodge Daytona Shelby Z\. Plymouth Voyager and the LeBaron sedan coupe and convertible 
48bc040m [tongue_click] The cars <will> <be> f- will be sold first in West Germany Belgium Austria the Netherlands and Switzerland 
48bc040n The road named West Street is a narrow strip of red gravel 
48bc040o It is like the proverbial railroad tracks in America that separate the rich side of town from the poor 
48bc040p Physical distance may not be great but the mental gap is 
48bc040q The Honduran legislator again I\'m almost convinced that the Sandinistas are going to be there forever 
48bc040r I think we should go into a peace process with them 
48bc040s I don\'t see ourselves going into a war and the Americans don\'t see themselves going into a Vietnama- Vietnam type war in Central America 
48bc040t Some wonder whether all the conv- conversions don\'t make Mr\. Beregovoy more of an opportunist than a believer in market economy 
48bc040u But his aides say he was convinced he was doing the right thing 
48bc040v Mr\. Beregovoy said I\'m not ashamed of what I do 
48bc040w The public filings show that a firm called Camro Associates acquired one \%PERCENT nonvoting stake in Seeme- . Seemala in nineteen eighty four 
48bc040x [tongue_click] Seemala disclosed the Camro stake in a public S\. E\. C\. filing that year Seemala didn\'t identify the investors in Camro 
48bc040y [loud_breath] [tongue_click] But a separate nineteen eighty four filing by Camro in California identifies Camro as a general partnership made up of Mr\. Milken and twenty six other Drexel employees 
48bc040z Roger Ailes the man who will guide George Bush\'s heavy media campaign is pumping up his anger like a lineman preparing to crush the opposing quarterback 
48bc0410 Michael Dukakis has the toughest knees and elbows today said the New York advertising executive who once pitched nixor- Richard Nixon as warm 
48bc0411 He\'s the meanest little son of a bitch I\'ve ever come across in politics 
48bc0412 Moans Stan Trilling a longtime O\. T\. C\. stockbroker at PaineWebber <in> in Los Angeles . It\'s like I know there\'s a parade out there [loud_breath] 
48bc0413 I can hear the band marching by 
48bc0414 [tongue_click] But they won\'t let me in the parade 
48bc0415 The overall market is being driven by these big cap takeover stocks but I\'m not participating 
48bc0416 Mr\. Turner may even know all this because his protectionist ardor is quite recent 
48bc0417 [tongue_click] In the nineteen seventies he was a globally minded finance minister under Pierre tru- Trudeau 
48bc0418 [tongue_click] Liberals led a royal commission that in nineteen eighty five endorsed free trade as the best way for Canada to reach its economic potential 
48bc0419 Like Richard Gephardt and some other U\. S\. Democrats Mr\. Turner must believe protectionism is a hot button to political office 
48bc041a [tongue_click] Insurance coverage for small medical bills is especially wasteful 
48bc041b Usually it will cost an insurer more than fifty dollars to monitor effectively a fifty dollar physician bill thereby doubling the cost of health insurance 
48bc041c Failure to monitor encourages patients and doctors to make wasteful decisions without fear of third party scrutiny 
48bc041d Europe by contrast offers a cornucopia of undervalued corporations and a wave of industrial restructuring stemming from its drive towards a single market by nineteen ninety two 
48bc041e In Spain U\. S\. investment banks took a huge chunk of the recent batch of bank mergers 
48bc041f Shearson helped . Italian financier Carlo De Benedetti make a pioneering albeit unsuccessful hostile bid for the giant Belgian holding company [loud_breath] Societe Generale de Belgique . last year 
48cc0201 The operating rate is still kind of low but it\'s coming back said Priscilla Luce senior economist at Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates in Philadelphia 
48cc0202 There is some cause for optimism 
48cc0203 She said export gains have spurred some of the improvement 
48cc0204 Texas started evaluating potential S\. S\. C\. sites about four years ago and now has solid data on six locations says Dillard Hammett state energy adviser 
48cc0205 Four more communities have since asked to be included 
48cc0206 Considering the state\'s flat relatively earthquake free landscape Mr\. Hammett says ninety five \%PERCENT of Texas could have the site 
48cc0207 There\'s probably also a psychological side to Augusta National\'s accent on experience 
48cc0208 The color that\'s second only to green hereabouts is gray 
48cc0209 It can be found mostly on the heads of participants and spectators 
48cc020a Gains from asset sales could offset the bank\'s increased loan loss provisions in later quarters 
48cc020b Mellon\'s interim chief executive Nathan Pearson told shareholders at the bank\'s annual meeting Monday that he expects Mellon to return to profitability this year 
48cc020c But several profitable Mellon businesses including trust operations and data processing could be swamped by continued losses from energy and real estate loans 
48cc020d This year the same forces are at work 
48cc020e I believe the chances of a repeat of last year\'s performance are high says William Sterling a Merrill Lynch economist in Tokyo 
48cc020f [tongue_click] He expects to see only about seven billion of additional spending not the thirty six billion that Mr\. Nakasone is talking about 
48cc020g In a letter to supporters Mr\. Nunn said his position as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee foreclosed a run for the White House 
48cc020h [loud_breath] If I attempted to run for president and also carry out my Senate duties I would wind up doing neither well he wrote 
48cc020i [loud_breath] Mr\. Nunn also expressed concern about the impact of a presidential campaign on my family 
48cc020j The confrontation in federal court may break new ground in bankruptcy law 
48cc020k Other courts notably the one in charge of the Manville Corporation Chapter eleven proceedings have set up trust funds to pay large classes of injury victims 
48cc020l But Manville\'s two \.POINT five billion to three billion dollar trust includes provisions that allow it to expand if funds prove inadequate to pay asbestos related claims 
48cc020m So far no judge has attempted to fix an absolute cap on a group of claims as huge and uncertain as those facing Robins 
48cc020n Another reason Mr\. Soifer is avoiding Morgan and Citicorp is that their stock prices at times have tended to gyrate more violently than other bank issues 
48cc020o Citicorp and Morgan tend to have more volatility on days when program trading is known to occur Mr\. Soifer says 
48cc020p They\'re more of a bet on which way the market is headed 
48cc020q In the two selected areas the state will allow procurement and retail prices to rise to what the open market demands 
48cc020r The subsidy for consumers is meant to reduce the strain on urban residents 
48cc020s Farmers of course will get higher prices for their grain from the market which in turn should induce them to increase production 
48cc020t Grain production throughout China has faltered in recent years in part because state procurement prices were too low 
48cc020u [tongue_click] Nicaragua\'s Sandinistas blamed a hardline Contra faction led by military commander Enrique Bermudez for slowing progress in four days of peace talks that ended Monday in Managua 
48cc020v Negotiations are scheduled to continue next week 
48cc020w They said Bermudez favored continued military efforts to oust the ruling Sandinista regime 
48cc020x [loud_breath] Last year several major cities including Jacksonville Florida and Charlotte N\. C\. prohibited or severely restricted construction of new outdoor advertisements 
48cc020y Just last month Saint Louis adopted a billboard ban 
48cc020z And officials in Richmond Virginia and Denver are considering cracking down 
48cc0210 World Bank President Barber Conable said the bank will send a delegation to Argentina next week to review the measures 
48cc0211 If the bank approves the details the bridge loan would go forward and the World Bank loans would be completed 
48cc0212 A bank spokesman said details of those loans won\'t be known until the delegation completes its work 
48cc0213 Estimates of the makeup of the feedlot population vary widely 
48cc0214 Most analysts expect the government to report that the number of young cattle placed on feedlots fell in July for the second consecutive month from a year earlier 
48cc0215 However some expect a rise 
48cc0216 He is striking now at a time when financing for big deals is readily available and the stock price is down 
48cc0217 As recently as August R\. J\. R\.\'s stock was trading lower than its forty nine dollar level when Mr\. Johnson took over in January nineteen eighty seven 
48cc0218 [loud_breath] The offer for a leveraged buy out probably will be at about seventy five dollars a share and now other tobacco stocks are soaring too 
48cc0219 [loud_breath] In the past year and a half I\. B\. M\. has bought pieces of nearly a dozen companies stepping up the pace in recent months 
48cc021a [loud_breath] The computer giant is mainly trying to buy technology or expertise in certain areas such as software for insurance companies in the case of its Policy Management stake 
48cc021b I\. B\. M\. also seems to be trying to buy software developers\' loyalty in the increasingly competitive industry 
48cc021c [tongue_click] Insurance coverage for small medical bills is especially wasteful 
48cc021d Usually it will cost an insurer more than fifty dollars to monitor effectively a fifty dollar physician bill thereby doubling the cost of health insurance 
48cc021e But failure to monitor encourages patients and doctors to make wasteful decisions without fear of third party scrutiny 
48cc0301 It\'s inconceivable that the directorate didn\'t know about Mr\. Rodriguez comments one international human rights worker who has studied the local refugee situation 
48cc0302 [loud_breath] The people of El Barillo are under the boot 
48cc0303 [loud_breath] They\'ve been smart enough to survive 
48cc0304 They\'ve adapted 
48cc0305 [loud_breath] To get its message to Madison Avenue decision makers Whittle Communications has been ma- running a series of slick ads in newspapers and media trade journals 
48cc0306 [loud_breath] We\'re wasting a lot of money on this ad announces a bold headline in one 
48cc0307 The point Virtually every advertiser in every medium is paying to reach viewers or readers who never become customers 
48cc0308 [loud_breath] No other likely bidders stepped forward Wednesday 
48cc0309 Hostile takeovers are almost unheard of in the defense industry 
48cc030a [loud_breath] But analysts have speculated that either Ford Motor Company or General Electric Corporation might be a good fit with Boeing if the companies were interested 
48cc030b Ford for instance has indicated it is looking for acquisitions and has accumulated about nine billion dollars it could use for such purposes 
48cc030c A Ford spokesman citing company policy would neither confirm nor deny speculation about its interest 
48cc030d G\. E\. declined comment but a source close to the company said it isn\'t interested in Boeing 
48cc030e Property casualty insurer Fireman\'s Fund has since nineteen eighty three made three unforeseen additions to reserves for claims totaling more than one billion dollars 
48cc030f [loud_breath] John Byrne Fireman\'s chairman says he\'s confident Fireman\'s is using e- excess resources to retire stock 
48cc030g But he concedes buy backs can be risky for insurers 
48cc030h [loud_breath] Also biotechnology companies are cash guzzlers constantly needing money for clinical trials and manufacturing facilities 
48cc030i The critical factor for most companies isn\'t how much cash they have but how it\'s being spent Mr\. MacCallum says 
48cc030j Some companies that are selling at close to their <pre> per share cash values are correctly being perceived in a skeptical light he contends 
48cc030k Mr\. Schmied is being tested early in a position he didn\'t seem eager to occupy 
48cc030l Analysts say he is an operations man who never exhibited any ambition to become chief executive 
48cc030m I never got the overwhelming sense that he was eager to succeed Mr\. Flavin says Christopher Demisch an analyst at First Boston Corporation 
48cc030n Moreover Mr\. Sawyer isn\'t thought to possess a lot of clout 
48cc030o [loud_breath] He doesn\'t fit the boss image that the late Mayor Daley made famous and that Mayor Washington was beginning to acquire 
48cc030p He\'s a weak guy says Mr\. Rose the political consultant subject to a lot of pressure and obviously not a crusader 
48cc030q Asked how he viewed the Prudential Bache unit Mr\. Winters said Are we pleased with their results 
48cc030r Of course not 
48cc030s Are we pleased with their direction 
48cc030t Yes 
48cc030u Mr\. Winters added that Prudential Bache may be more deliberate this year in some of its expansion 
48cc030v He also voiced confidence in Chairman George Ball despite the losses calling him the most qualified guy in the U\. S\. 
48cc030w [tongue_click] For authors and publishers a new competitor in the book club field is a godsend 
48cc030x Book club rights are second only to paperback rights in providing additional revenue for publishers 
48cc030y Furthermore a book club imprimatur on a book gives it enormous cachet with bookstore managers 
48cc030z Not long after the Northwest announcement the institute wired a press release to media organizations detailing the large number of passenger complaints about Northwest\'s service 
48cc0310 Airline passengers who fly Northwest appear to have a lot to complain about and they did so in droves last year the release began 
48cc0311 [loud_breath] It went on to say the complaints against Northwest increased one thousand four hundred eighteen \%PERCENT in the past year 
48cc0312 Many blame that change on simple geography and an effort to move away from unions 
48cc0313 But some critics also accuse the Japanese companies of deliberately avoiding blacks 
48cc0314 Honda and the U\. S\. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission settled a big racial discrimination case last month 
48cc0315 [loud_breath] The two laboratories that Nichols purchased are in Lincoln Nebraska and Sioux City Iowa 
48cc0316 Initial payments for the labs totaled eleven \.POINT six million dollars in cash and preferred stock 
48cc0317 Additional payments to be made over an eight year period have a current value of six \.POINT one million dollars Nichols said 
48cc0318 The additional payments are contingent upon certain material aspects of the business of the two labs remaining intact for three years Nichols said 
48cc0319 [tongue_click] Since Monday\'s opening bell N\. C\. N\. B\. shares have jumped four and three eighths points closing at twenty seven and seven eighths yesterday 
48cc031a Many analysts predict the stock could go higher soon perhaps crossing the thirty dollar a share barrier for the first time in a year 
48cc031b Long term bulls predict N\. C\. N\. B\.\'s price could easily double and some say triple 
48cc031c The agency has been under growing pressure from Representative John Dingell Democrat Michigan and other lawmakers to tighten regulation of the generics industry 
48cc031d Senator Orrin Hatch Republican Utah ranking minority member on the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee welcomed the plan 
48cc031e It is my strong belief that sufficient evidence has been uncovered to warrant these changes he said in a statement 
48cc0401 It\'s a sad day for Wall Street said a First Boston Corporation spokesman 
48cc0402 Stock traders cautioned that the government hasn\'t yet won convictions on its latest cases 
48cc0403 But both lawmakers and stock market professionals said yesterday\'s arrests send a clear signal An overhaul of takeover and securities practices has become increasingly likely 
48cc0404 Senator William Proxmire Democrat Wisconsin sharply criticized the Fed for dropping the M\. one target 
48cc0405 He also contended that it is an extremely dangerous and unwise policy to allow M\. one to expand as rapidly as it has 
48cc0406 Last year M\. one which consists of checking deposits plus cash held by the public soared fifteen \.POINT two \%PERCENT 
48cc0407 That was far above the Fed\'s target of three \%PERCENT to eight \%PERCENT 
48cc0408 When Hu Yaobang was dumped in January as the Communist Party\'s secretary general Mr\. Zhao was elevated to that post on an acting basis 
48cc0409 That made Mr\. Zhao a protege of Deng Xiaoping the de facto head of the party as well as the government 
48cc040a It is a delicate position requiring him to maneuver among various interest groups and personal cliques that make up China\'s top leadership 
48cc040b Some have characterized our countermeasures as protectionist brought about because of congressional pressures 
48cc040c That is dead wrong 
48cc040d We have been in consultations with Japan on this issue since November long before present trade legislation was introduced 
48cc040e The president\'s action was the culmination of that process and it had nothing whatsoever to do with trade bills 
48cc040f President Reagan believes that people and nations should honor their obligations 
48cc040g There is nothing protectionist about that 
48cc040h The one hundred share index closed ten \.POINT six points higher at two thousand two hundred seventy one \.POINT eight

48cc040k Volume was light at four hundred fifty four \.POINT six million shares compared with seven hundred fifty one \.POINT four million Friday 
48cc040l The clearest indication of Japan\'s biotechnology ambitions may be the attention being given the field by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
48cc040m When MITI gets involved it\'s a safe bet the nation\'s senior strategists have targeted an industry for a big push 
48cc040n Though MITI does some biotech research its main role is to spur and guide work by others

48cc040q There aren\'t any financial irregularities he says

48cc040s Mr\. Carson is said to have decided to sell Carson Productions piecemeal instead of as a going concern

48cc0415 Mr\. Papageorge said These were conceptual negotiations 
48cc0416 Ideas were flowing 
48cc0417 We were seeing what worked for each of us 
48cc0418 The two of us were trying to think of a way to satisfy everyone 
48cc0419 But it\'s what this election is all about 
48cc041a The real question on the ballot is Should the Reagan Years continue beyond the Reagan years 
48cc041b Beyond the Bush years 
48cc041c Beyond even the Quayle years 
48cc041d The Supreme Court will determine that and the next president will determine the court\'s makeup for at least another generation

48dc0202 [loud_breath] The hotel operator\'s Embassy Suites Hotels Incorporated subsidiary [loud_breath] will continue to manage the properties 
48dc0203 [loud_breath] Long term management contracts allow us to generate income on a significantly lower capital base said Michael D\. Rose Holiday\'s chairman and chief executive officer 
48dc0204 Albert Halprin chief of the F\. C\. C\.\'s common carrier bureau said he hadn\'t seen the consumer group\'s study 
48dc0205 [loud_breath] He said previous studies by the group had focused on flat rate service for local calls 
48dc0206 [loud_breath] Mr\. Halprin conceded that such rates had risen sharply but he added that phone companies now offer a variety of local telephone plans at differing prices 
48dc0207 Around that time Mr\. Genger also met with Mr\. el Sayed 
48dc0208 He surfaced to meet with Genger after Genger had made the approach to the company said Mr\. Trotman the Drexel Burnham banker 
48dc0209 [loud_breath] I think he was trying to find a way back in

48dc020b Instead Mr\. Reagan agreed to lower the volume of his comments supporting the Contras and criticizing the Democratic controlled Congress 
48dc020c He also would hold off on any new proposals for Contra military aid until September thirtieth 
48dc020d If the Sandinista government had made significant democratic reforms and a ceasefire was in place Mr\. Reagan would end his Contra military aid program 
48dc020e [loud_breath] In Korea labor conflicts have added heat to the unstable political situation 
48dc020f The new unions are growing more adversarial 
48dc020g Companies keep asking the government to smash the unions 
48dc020h But the ruling party can\'t risk alienating workers who will vote in the coming elections 
48dc020i It refuses so far to backtrack on its July first promise of greater democracy or to return to the policy of overt union busting 
48dc020j In a nineteen seventy eight to seventy nine administrative proceeding the S\. E\. C\.\'s enforcement division pressed for Mr\. Kobrin\'s permanent expulsion from the securities business 
48dc020k The division argued that stock manipulation of the kind he had been engaged in went to the heart of the securities laws 
48dc020l The division also said the law directed the S\. E\. C\. to act on the belief that past misconduct raised a risk of future misconduct that might justify expulsion 
48dc020m Certainly foreign competition and a changing world economy have exacted a heavy toll on our nation\'s manufacturing industries 
48dc020n However many of these industries have survived and are now as tough and lean as they\'ve ever been 
48dc020o The managers of these companies have learned through hard experience about exactly which investments pay off 
48dc020p Although airlines deny handling complaints differently they make no apologies about favoring frequent fliers in other ways 
48dc020q They say they are only trying to boost membership in these programs which airlines consider crucial for developing brand loyalty 
48dc020r These are our most important customers says a United spokesman 
48dc020s Mr\. Antoniu\'s fall and surprising rebound prove there is life after insider trading 
48dc020t But his story also suggests that some character traits that may give rise to insider training can be hard to change 
48dc020u Insider trading is a form of fraud and some Sport About franchisees now claim they have been defrauded by Mr\. Antoniu 
48dc020v Still traders were encouraged by investor reaction to this week\'s Treasury financing especially yesterday\'s thirty year bond sale 
48dc020w We thought there was very broad Japanese participation in the bond auction said [loud_breath] Mr\. Lakefield of Shearson Lehman 
48dc020x [loud_breath] But the real question is whether the Japanese bought for short term trading accounts or for long term investment 
48dc020y Individual investors looking for some excitement in their lives aren\'t likely to be enthralled by Mr\. Berg\'s advice 
48dc020z He suggests that they drop their hard earned dollars into the most conservative of investments T\. bills and sit tight 
48dc0210 There\'s no sense trying to play games with this market Mr\. Berg explains 
48dc0211 Things are a bit duller this year 
48dc0212 Mr\. Bilzerian has sent his boy to a Little League team in faraway Minnesota where the family spends its summers and isn\'t coaching a team this year 
48dc0213 All the action apparently will be in the courtroom 
48dc0214 The Grand Metropolitan operations which were acquired by that company in nineteen eighty have enjoyed a good reputation in the industry 
48dc0215 But PepsiCo feels its territories can be better exploited due to their proximity to exisiting company owned bottlers 
48dc0216 It owns its Los Angeles and San Francisco bottlers for instance making the central California territory a good fit 
48dc0217 It also already owns its bottlers in central and northern Florida and parts of Georgia 
48dc0218 There are some great opportunities to maximize production and marketing efficiencies the PepsiCo spokesman said 
48dc0219 Peter DaPuzzo head of retail trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton also looks for a sharp upward move in stock prices given a few ifs 
48dc021a One is if investors don\'t get spooked at the anniversary of the crash 
48dc021b Another is if the Federal Reserve eases interest rates 
48dc021c And a third is if George Bush wins the presidential election 
48dc021d But Service Merchandise jumped one and three eighths to eighteen and one quarter on one \.POINT four million shares 
48dc021e The stock slid to twelve and one quarter in September after the company announced that an investor group had decided not to proceed with a possible acquisition offer 
48dc021f Since then the stock has been rising on takeover rumors 
48dc0301 When Hu Yaobang was dumped in January as the Communist Party\'s secretary general Mr\. Zhao was elevated to that post on an acting basis 
48dc0302 That made Mr\. Zhao a protege of Deng Xiaoping the de facto head of the party as well as the government 
48dc0303 It is a delicate position requiring him to maneuver among various interest groups and personal cliques that make up China\'s top leadership 
48dc0304 PaineWebber itself hasn\'t been charged with wrongdoing 
48dc0305 [loud_breath] The firm a unit of PaineWebber Group Incorporated released a short statement yesterday in which it said the two men have been suspended indefinitely 
48dc0306 The firm has cooperated with the U\. S\. Attorney\'s office throughout the investigation and will continue to do so 
48dc0307 Then there are utility stocks 
48dc0308 The Nasdaq Utility Index jumped eighteen \%PERCENT in the first quarter while indexes of listed utility stocks rose barely three \%PERCENT 
48dc0309 But in fact most of the fifty five electric gas and water utility stocks on Nasdaq performed much like their counterparts on the major exchanges 
48dc030a Producers however say the guild demand really represents an effort to squeeze in more than one session a day 
48dc030b The actors are paid by the session not by the hour and both sides agree that sessions rarely exceed three hours 
48dc030c And with the guild choosing such a critical time for the strike [loud_breath] T\. V\. production officials are especially irate 
48dc030d When my family fled we left my nanny in charge of the house 
48dc030e [loud_breath] But soon a lieutenant in the revolutionary army evicted her and installed his mistress 
48dc030f Later the house went to the North Koreans 
48dc030g F\. D\. A\. researchers say they don\'t know much yet about the long term effects of fat substitutes mixing with medication and other substances 
48dc030h Typically lab tests on food products are for the life cycle of rats or mice about four years 
48dc030i Researchers say they aren\'t sure such tests parallel human consumption of fat over longer periods 
48dc030j We just don\'t know says the F\. D\. A\.\'s Mr\. Mertz 
48dc030k With every new development there are risks 
48dc030l Announcement of the talks surprised analysts and failed to impress investors 
48dc030m [loud_breath] British Aerospace shares fell twenty five pence forty four cents to three hundred and twenty nine pence in late trading yesterday on London\'s stock exchange 
48dc030n The handful of Rover shares trading jumped nineteen pence to eighty six pence after the announcement but fell back to eighty two pence 
48dc030o Mr\. Thayer said Mr\. Young received a lump sum payment to settle his contract with Gibraltar Financial but wouldn\'t disclose the amount 
48dc030p Mr\. Young\'s contract which ran until January twenty fourth nineteen ninety one [loud_breath] called for a salary of at least four hundred and ten thousand dollars a year 
48dc030q In nineteen eighty six Mr\. Young was paid five hundred and fifty thousand five hundred and ninety six dollars 
48dc030r As a recent visit revealed the soup kitchen has become a powerful magnet drawing hundreds who come for more than just daily nourishment 
48dc030s Mr\. Kovacs an octogenarian who croons love ballads to anyone who will listen comes for camaraderie 
48dc030t For George a middle aged retarded man the kitchen is a lifeline 
48dc030u He arrived five years ago picked up a broom and without saying a word started cleaning up he now gets paid the minimum wage 
48dc030v The offer is a brilliant defense contrived by Santa Fe\'s investment bankers at Salomon Brothers and Goldman Sachs 
48dc030w A sixty three dollar a share price will hang over the negotiations like smog over Los Angeles 
48dc030x And though Mr\. Dingman will offer package after package that seems to add up to sixty three dollars he doesn\'t really plan to meet the asking price 
48dc030y Instead he hopes to persuade Santa Fe to take less 
48dc030z For one hundred years Wyoming has been riding a roller coaster 
48dc0310 When commodity prices rise people rush to Wyoming for short term work at boom town pay 
48dc0311 Government revenues largely underwritten by energy company taxes explode 
48dc0312 When commodity prices sour people pull out often with their mobile homes trailing behind 
48dc0313 And revenues slump 
48dc0314 The reason for the relatively modest incentive programs is that the auto makers are demonstrating a much better ability to keep production in line with sales 
48dc0315 Inventories of U\. S\. made cars stood at fifty nine days supply at the end of August according to Ward\'s Automotive Reports an industry trade publication 
48dc0316 That is considered a normal supply and it is the lowest stock in twenty two months 
48dc0317 Takeover talk aroused interest in two financial concerns 
48dc0318 Mercantile Bancorp soared five and one half to thirty and three quarters on renewed buy out speculation 
48dc0319 Sun State Savings and Loan ended at eight and one quarter up two after confirming that it received an unsolicited acquisition proposal from an investment group 
48dc031a In Houston a Coastal spokesman said the fight isn\'t over 
48dc031b [loud_breath] We anticipate asking for a rehearing or appealing to the Supreme Court the spokesman said 
48dc031c He added We were quite surprised by the reversal 
48dc031d We thought we had a solid case 
48dc0401 I\'ve been trying to live my life by an idea she says pointing to a video game 
48dc0402 See that machine 
48dc0403 That\'s an idea 
48dc0404 Rock and roll 
48dc0405 That\'s an idea 
48dc0406 In heavy trading Friday profit taking caused the Nikkei average to slip seventy \.POINT eighteen to twenty one thousand one hundred and five \.POINT eight five 
48dc0407 The decline snapped a string of five record closings 
48dc0408 The stock exchange index fell twelve \.POINT nine two points to one eighteen hundred and sixteen \.POINT six nine 
48dc0409 Volume totaled about one billion shares 
48dc040a Mr\. Abboud also gained a reputation during the First Chicago years as being abrasive and sometimes harsh with subordinates and that tag has lingered 
48dc040b I\'ve never seen an adjective used so much in connection with a person\'s name he said in a nineteen eighty four interview 
48dc040c People think the A\. in A\. Robert Abboud stands for abrasive 
48dc040d In Amsterdam stocks closed lower in volatile trading 
48dc040e Selected issues ended off their intraday lows though after Wall Street\'s lower opening proved less severe than some Dutch forecasters anticipated dealers said 
48dc040f [tongue_click] Volatile trading throughout the session produced wide price fluctuations as Dutch institutions bargain hunted while overseas investors tended to sell shares 
48dc040g Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value 
48dc040h Thus higher bidding narrows the investor\'s return while lower bidding widens it 
48dc040i The percentage rates are calculated on a three hundred and sixty day year while the coupon equivalent yield is based on a three hundred and sixty five day year 
48dc040j Technically the stopgap bill will leave the government out of money over the weekend 
48dc040k But that should have little practical effect since most operations will be closed during that time 
48dc040l Congressional leaders hope however it will pressure lawmakers to finish their work before Monday 
48dc040m Some months before the crash interest rates started to move up 
48dc040n Home mortgage rates went up almost ten times as fast as they came down 
48dc040o The money supply growth was muddling at or below the lower end of the target range a phenomenon we have not experienced for many years 
48dc040p For a ship or missile guided by the wrong time signal that little gap could mean arriving at the wrong destination 
48dc040q If we let the difference grow says Mr\. McCarthy we could run into problems over thousands of years 
48dc040r It might be noon by atomic time but dark outside 
48dc040s This heady mixture of piety and gutter fighting we fear is likely to detract from causes we would like to advance 
48dc040t This is perfectly illustrated by Mr\. Robertson\'s charge that there are Russian intermediate range missiles in Cuba 
48dc040u It is perfectly true that the I\. N\. F\. treaty gives us no rights to inspect for missiles in the Soviet\'s island satellite 
48dc040v And it is true that Soviet bases there are a danger to the U\. S\. 
48dc040w But to pose these valid issues in the most inflammatory way Mr\. Robertson has charged that the missiles are already deployed and in place 
48dc040x If this is presented as the issue the answer is no and the valid points are lost 
48dc040y Kaiser\'s present value is equally uncertain the company estimates that its net worth is at least a negative five hundred million dollars 
48dc040z In its lawsuits against former management the company is seeking damages of more than three hundred million dollars for alleged self dealing and mismanagement 
48dc0410 [loud_breath] In the process the suits allege assets were overstated and liabilities understated 
48dc0411 The shortage of Western capacity makes Soviet launchers attractive 
48dc0412 A series of launch disasters including the Challenger explosion severely curtailed Western access to space in nineteen eighty six to eighty seven 
48dc0413 The European Ariane launcher just returned to commercial service 
48dc0414 The U\. S\. space program will not eliminate its backlog of payloads until the early nineteen nineties 
48dc0415 You think that\'s weird 
48dc0416 Think again 
48dc0417 He\'s not alone 
48dc0418 Carbide\'s sabotage theory is weakened partly because it hasn\'t disclosed all its evidence 
48dc0419 Though its attorneys say they have interviewed the alleged saboteur extensively they won\'t disclose his name or whereabouts or describe him 
48dc041a They also decline to say whether they understand his motives or have any witnesses 
48dc041b The one element of suspense remains the selection of a running mate for Vice President Bush\'s presidential campaign 
48dc041c Bush managers insist they won\'t disclose the vice presidential nominee\'s identity until Thursday morning 
48dc041d Reagan arrived at the convention site last night and prepared for his farewell speech to the party tonight 
48dc041e The president leaves for California tomorrow and Bush will arrive to take control of the convention 
48dc041f It is a crucial time in which Bush must attempt to move out from under Reagan\'s shadow and establish his own identity 
48ec0201 Phil Walters whose back yard would have faced the proposed shelter says he went to meetings to learn both sides of the shelter debate 
48ec0202 But just for wanting to hear the pros and cons I became a pro derelict revolutionary in the eyes of some people he recalls 
48ec0203 They didn\'t want an objective study 
48ec0204 They just wanted to prevent the onslaught of the bums 
48ec0205 France Fund Inc\. had a net asset value of fourteen dollars and forty six cents and a closing price of ten and an eighth as of Thursday 
48ec0206 Gabelli Equity Trust Incorporated had a net asset value of nine dollars thirty six cents and a closing price of eight and seven eighths as of Friday 
48ec0207 In the listing of publicly traded funds in an earlier edition the lines were reversed 
48ec0208 Bancroft Convertible Fund Inc\. had a net asset value of twenty five dollars eighty eight cents and a closing price of twenty seven and a quarter as of Friday 
48ec0209 In nineteen eighty some government employees C\. I\. A\. had to give up First Amendment rights 
48ec020a Now it is suggested that officials give up Fifth Amendment rights 
48ec020b In nineteen eighty someone is going to suggest that government officials give up their Fourth Amendment rights protecting them from unlawful searches 
48ec020c Why not 
48ec020d They may be hiding important documents in their homes 
48ec020e Cable operators are willing participants in the price cutting programs 
48ec020f For one thing because of deregulation which took effect January first the operators have been allowed to raise rates for basic cable service 
48ec020g In addition the pay networks are cutting the prices they charge operators 
48ec020h Congress gave the space agency\'s plan mixed reviews 
48ec020i Representative Bill Lowery Republican of California who has been outspoken about the importance of securing a second booster rocket supplier praised the plan 
48ec020j [misc_noise] Competition fuels excellence he said and this is the first step toward a solid rocket motor with better safety precautions and more efficient production 
48ec020k Energy experts consider Amoco and Exxon among the industry\'s healthiest companies financially with strong credit ratings and low debt 
48ec020l Amoco\'s financial statements show it had four hundred and forty one million dollars in cash and marketable securities on hand at the close of nineteen eighty six 
48ec020m In recent talks with analysts Amoco officials have said the company is well positioned financially if it decides to make an acquisition 
48ec020n Moreover a Western firm has to make some calculation of whether Mr\. Gorbachev [loud_breath] will succeed in his efforts to activate the Soviet work force 
48ec020o Past experience and current reports indicate that his chances aren\'t good 
48ec020p Rowland Evans and Robert Novak reported from Moscow last week that the party apparatchiks and disaffected Soviet workers already are undermining reforms 
48ec020q The government faces a knotty surplus problem 
48ec020r U\. S\. storage bins hold roughly an eight month supply of corn and ten month supply of wheat when a three month supply would do 
48ec020s Making matters worse the harvest ripening in the fields promises to be a monster portending record post harvest supplies of corn and a glut of other commodities 
48ec020t To help cut production the U\. S\. is paying farmers an annual rent for ten years to idle erosion prone crop land under a conservation reserve program 
48ec020u Humana tried to defend itself through diversification as did the other large chains Hospital Corp\. of America American Medical International Incorporated and National Medical Enterprises Incorporated 
48ec020v The idea was that if a hospital owner also had an insurance plan it could steer patients to its institutions through financial incentives 
48ec020w The patient pool might shrink but the company could grab a bigger part of it 
48ec020x Kemp\'s campaign takes on an increasingly desperate tone 
48ec020y In one sure sign of a candidacy in trouble he lashes out at criticism from a lightly regarded T\. V\. commentator 
48ec020z Even some supporters now say privately that he should aim for the vice presidential nomination 
48ec0210 But his longtime hostilities with Dole leave a spot on a Bush ticket as about the only possibility 
48ec0211 We\'ve never had one before Mr\. Timbers said 
48ec0212 A certain percentage of our clients would like to have that option 
48ec0213 It\'s not necessarily a market call 
48ec0214 Mr\. Timbers says he\'s fairly ambivalent about the price of gold near term 
48ec0215 He does see however higher inflation of five \%PERCENT or so in nineteen eighty nine up from four \%PERCENT this year 
48ec0216 A gold option could be a nice alternative for fixed income investors should inflation fears arise Mr\. Timbers says 
48ec0217 But he warns that companies should ask how much stock is too much 
48ec0218 A director holding a large block may become more interested in short term results than long term corporate health 
48ec0219 That director may be more tempted to vote his pocketbook in a takeover fight says Mr\. Wolf 
48ec021a As Britain\'s flag carrier the airline inherited a vast route network 
48ec021b British Caledonian brought routes to the southern U\. S\. the Middle East and Africa as well as *lucrative* flights to East Asia 
48ec021c British Airways gave up only a few routes from Gatwick to European cities which in most cases it already served from Heathrow 
48ec021d Mr\. Baker is also well acquainted with Rudolph Giuliani the U\. S\. attorney for Manhattan who is overseeing that office\'s investigation of Drexel 
48ec021e As White House chief of staff Mr\. Baker offered Mr\. Giuliani the chairmanship of the S\. E\. C\. in nineteen eighty seven 
48ec021f Mr\. Giuliani declined the post which was later accepted by David S\. Ruder 
48ec0301 All the gains that we\'re making are at the local level says James F\. McDonald G\. M\.\'s president 
48ec0302 That may be the most important thing happening in heavy industry in the U\. S\. today 
48ec0303 Indeed the era of big time national labor talks in which union and management leaders butt heads over pennies an hour is waning 
48ec0304 Also selling well was a fifty million dollar issue of revenue bonds by the Florida Department of Natural Resources 
48ec0305 The unsold balance was about ten \.POINT three million dollars 
48ec0306 The bonds were priced after auction to yield from four \.POINT two \%PERCENT in nineteen eighty eight to seven \.POINT two \%PERCENT in two thousand and twelve 
48ec0307 Moody\'s rated the bonds single A\. while S\. and P\. rated them single A\. minus

48ec030d Now feel yourself playing with the dolphins and invite them back to play with you here Mr\. Rowe says 
48ec030e He has said some of us will become dolphins 
48ec030f Despite my best efforts I remain a reporter seated on a chair in a bookstore 
48ec030g Mr\. Zinn said Entertainment Marketing is still weighing a proxy fight 
48ec030h It\'s a bad feeling in your stomach when the chairman and previous bidder is selling his block he said 
48ec030i It doesn\'t make me as a shareholder comfortable with what is happening in the company 
48ec030j He also was emphatic about keeping Burger King 
48ec030k I want to say without qualification that Burger King is central to Pillsbury 
48ec030l It was true yesterday it is true today and it remains true for the company\'s strategic future he said 
48ec030m Some issuers also are wary of doing away with outside counsel 
48ec030n In Washington state a proposal to use the attorney general as counsel on all state bond issues came before a legislative committee last year 
48ec030o Its adoption would have saved Washington more than two hundred thousand dollars a year 
48ec030p Strong opposition from the attorney general\'s office defeated the proposal however 
48ec030q Mr\. Moreland couldn\'t be reached for comment but attorneys representing him have previously denied he committed any acts of fraud 
48ec030r An attorney for Mr\. Reynolds in San Diego said we feel our client did nothing in violation of the securities laws 
48ec030s Joseph A\. Johnson a geologist allegedly hired by Mr\. Moreland who is also named as a defendant in the suit said he hadn\'t yet been served 
48ec030t Grains and soybeans The threat of rain and favorable spring planting conditions pushed soybeans and corn futures prices lower 
48ec030u The latest weather forecast calls for fairly good moisture in Midwest farming states over the next six to ten days 
48ec030v Analysts said traders are shifting their emphasis away from last year\'s crops and to this year\'s 
48ec030w With this year\'s small acreage increases weather and spring planting conditions are major concerns to a market that is beginning to shake off a huge surplus 
48ec030x The favorable conditions helped the soybean contract for November settlement close at six \.POINT eight two two five dollars a bushel down nine \.POINT five cents 
48ec030y Further signs of strong U\. S\. economic growth are expected to emerge from a Labor Department report next Friday on the nation\'s employment picture for August 
48ec030z If so Federal Reserve officials may raise short term interest rates further within a few weeks several analysts said 
48ec0310 They also predicted the banks will raise their prime or base rates again to ten and a half \%PERCENT or eleven \%PERCENT from the current ten \%PERCENT level 
48ec0311 The study was part of Cornell\'s response to calls by local politicians that it should help more in Tompkins County 
48ec0312 When the schools were ranked by operating budget or value of buildings Cornell\'s one \.POINT two million dollar payments were found to be near the bottom of the list 
48ec0313 In per student payments Cornell ranked seventh at seventy dollars 
48ec0314 To be sure on a lot of scores the summit was a success 
48ec0315 Economic cooperation was advanced with businessmen signing agreements for about thirty contracts and several joint ventures 
48ec0316 Human rights too may have taken a step forward if Mr\. Gorbachev lives up to his promise to release all political prisoners by year\'s end 
48ec0317 B\. P\. could spend up to ten billion dollars on a U\. S\. takeover Mr\. Lazier says by financing it with a blend of debt and equity 
48ec0318 Los Angeles based Unocal Corp\. with extensive refining and marketing activities on the West Coast long has been seen as a possible acquisition target 
48ec0319 Buying Unocal could also give B\. P\. a needed boost in its natural gas reserves 
48ec031a Other takeover possibilities include Phillips Petroleum Company of Bartlesville Oklahoma and New York based Amerada Hess Corp\. 
48ec031b As a result it can make sales in keeping with market conditions without having a significant effect on its economy Mr\. Nichols said 
48ec031c Last year it\'s estimated the Soviet Union made between two hundred and twenty million and two hundred and thirty million from sales of palladium 
48ec031d It made billions on gold 
48ec0401 The department also said that productivity for nonfinancial companies increased at a zero \.POINT three \%PERCENT annual rate in the third quarter a preliminary estimate 
48ec0402 The estimate is based on an increase in output of one \.POINT four \%PERCENT and an increase in hours worked of one \.POINT one \%PERCENT 
48ec0403 This was the first quarter in which productivity increased in the nonfinancial sector since the third quarter of nineteen eighty five 
48ec0404 In recent years however insider trading cases have sometimes involved people who are quite remote from companies that are the subject of inside information 
48ec0405 Since nineteen eighty the Supreme Court has suggested without being specific that such cases might involve misappropriation or illegal use of information 
48ec0406 A decision in the Winans case may help define securities fraud by misappropriation 
48ec0407 These teens crave excitement 
48ec0408 They spurn rest and recreation 
48ec0409 They dream about power and pots of money 
48ec040a Especially money 
48ec040b Last month Piedmont\'s board recommended that the company accept Norfolk Southern\'s bid to acquire the company for sixty five dollars a share 
48ec040c Norfolk Southern has had a stake in Piedmont since nineteen eighty one 
48ec040d But one day after the board\'s recommendation U\. S\. Air sweetened its initial bid for Piedmont forcing the board to drop its recommendation 
48ec040e Inco\'s stock has caught technical analysts\' attention too 
48ec040f It recently broke out of a five year trading range says Martin Pring editor of Pring Market Review 
48ec040g He thinks the stock could be poised for big gains reflecting what may be a bull market in base metals 
48ec040h Was that the earth shifting in Mike *Kinsley*\'s Viewpoint column yesterday on the page opposite A Democrats\' Guide to Robert Bork 
48ec040i Mr\. Kinsley called the Roe v\. 
48ec040j Wade abortion decision one of the judicial excesses of activist judges 
48ec040k Then we found ourselves described as the center of conservative intellectual hypocrisy on judicial restraint 
48ec040l We believe we\'re coming to understand the meaning of neoliberal an ex liberal who attacks conservatives in the process of adopting their positions 
48ec040m The finding uniformly surprised longtime researchers in the field 
48ec040n There is a specific rationale behind T\. H\. A\. says Doctor Leon Thal a researcher at San Diego Veterans Administration Hospital 
48ec040o But the results were overwhelming and when you get results like that out of the blue the first reaction is to be skeptical 
48ec040p That test was less than a complete success 
48ec040q Dirt that accumulated in the kenaf during harvesting wasn\'t all removed and ended up in the paper 
48ec040r The kenaf also jammed in some equipment because it had been cut in lengths that were several feet long 
48ec040s Representative Foley said there was general agreement that a deficit reduction package could consist half of spending cuts and half revenue raising measures 
48ec040t But negotiators still couldn\'t agree on what constitutes revenue raisers or spending cuts 
48ec040u House Republican Leader Robert Michel of Illinois complained I\'m just asking the Democrats to give us real savings 
48ec040v Most Arab states broke off relations with Egypt when that country signed a peace treaty with Israel eight years ago 
48ec040w Oman Sudan and Somalia didn\'t cut relations with Egypt

48ec0415 Even after finding a buyer completing a foreclosure sale is hardly routine 
48ec0416 Brokers at Merrill Lynch Realty recall a sale that was delayed for a month by a one million dollar Internal Revenue Service lien on the property 
48ec0417 Another sale was delayed when the lender discovered that the owner had died between the time the property was posted for foreclosure and the foreclosure was completed 
48ec0418 We were at the closing table when this all came out says Wanda Hutchins the Merrill Lynch agent 
48ec0419 Invalid foreclosures are one of the biggest problems we have 
48ec041a The lower volatility could be especially important right now when the course of interest rates seems especially cloudy 
48ec041b While interest rates have been declining recently many economists expect rates to rise by year end 
48ec041c After that however they say rates could fall again perhaps sharply as economic growth slows in nineteen eighty nine 
48ec041d The most widely used estrogen product in the U\. S\. is sold under the brand name Premarin by American Home Products Corp\.\'s Wyeth Ayerst Laboratories 
48ec041e In nineteen eighty eight sales of Premarin largely to prevent osteoporosis jumped twenty six \%PERCENT to two hundred and thirty six million dollars 
48ec041f A spokesman for the company said Premarin isn\'t currently indicated for use in preventing heart disease but the company is researching the matter 
48fc0201 The accord most likely would include some private agreement among ministers on how far up or down these rates can move and still be acceptable 
48fc0202 But officials said it is unlikely these limits would be made public 
48fc0203 [tongue_click] And it isn\'t known yet whether the major powers would pledge to intervene in currency markets if exchange rates were to exceed those limits 
48fc0204 [tongue_click] How is Wall Street reacting to the changes 
48fc0205 Some investment bankers feel threatened by it others scoff at suggestion that these efforts are truly competitive 
48fc0206 But some say the case isn\'t clear 
48fc0207 Few developers are big enough to justify the cost of these divisions 
48fc0208 The test will be whether the new units are adding value to their organizations 
48fc0209 If not one investment banker says the partners will kill them 
48fc020a In Cleveland Higbee chief executive officer Robert Broadbent says the retailer has benefited from its parent\'s financial expertise 
48fc020b Although it will retain control Industrial Equity is planning to take Higbee public again probably in June 
48fc020c [tongue_click] Meanwhile says Mr\. Broadbent They\'ve made us more inquisitive about acquisitions ourselves 
48fc020d Despite worries about investment bankers lending money for buyouts Morgan Stanley did better than Owens Illinois\' public bondholders will do 
48fc020e Annualized it earned eighty \%PERCENT pre tax on its three month three hundred million dollar loan to Owens Illinois Mr\. Niehaus says

48fc020j His is a tax exempt not for profit corporation dedicated to helping minors the sick and the needy 
48fc020k It also has greatly helped the Smith family 
48fc020l Last year the corporation paid the Smiths and a son in law more than three hundred forty eight thousand dollars in salaries and bonuses 
48fc020m Mr\. Smith also had an outstanding unsecured personal loan of one hundred twelve thousand dollars and enjoyed other perquisites

48fc020o U\. S\. utilities could also increase orders of foreign uranium ahead of any total import restrictions analysts say 
48fc020p Uranium from South Africa for example has already fallen under anti apartheid sanctions 
48fc020q But last year said the Uranium Institute U\. S\. imports of South African uranium surged three hundred \%PERCENT to more than thirteen \.POINT two million pounds

48fc020y The dirt road comes to a paved intersection and Mr\. Kgori begins a right turn 
48fc020z Up ahead he spots a roadblock where a white policeman with a dog is holding up three blacks traveling on a donkey pulled wagon 
48fc0210 Mr\. Kgori decides to go straight on the dirt road even though it will take him an hour out of his way 
48fc0211 That was illustrated by a temporary surge in securities lending during last October\'s crash and a previous securities settlements backlog in Britain 
48fc0212 Said one U\. K\. monetary official Clearly there was demand in the market for more equities money broking 
48fc0213 What you are seeing with Shearson\'s move is a reflection of that demand 
48fc0214 Some banking analysts doubt a London or Tokyo bank would make a similar acquisition anytime here soon 
48fc0215 Among other things some foreign banks have been shying away from acquiring assets in the U\. S\. because of unexpectedly high expenses managing them from afar 
48fc0216 Instead the trend among foreign banks is to increasingly build alliances with U\. S\. banks 
48fc0217 He returned home in time for his fifteenth birthday in March nineteen eighty six

48fc021e To the extent that export growth continues it will keep the U\. S\. economy from slipping added Mr\. Witten 
48fc021f So you can have a soft landing scenario based on expanding exports 
48fc021g A soft landing combines moderate economic growth with low inflation 
48fc0301 Prices moved up in response to news that U\. S\. durable goods orders declined seven and a half \%PERCENT in January 
48fc0302 Prices also slid after the release of the Tower Commission report on the Reagan administration\'s involvement in the Iran Contra affair

48fc0304 [tongue_click] Mr\. Epstein said he set some very short range goals to help Penril get back into the black 
48fc0305 [tongue_click] His plans include restructuring some debt and selling one of the company\'s five divisions to generate enough capital to finance the growth of the other four 
48fc0306 [tongue_click] He declined to identify the division that will be sold 
48fc0307 The look and feel cases are generating controversy in the industry 
48fc0308 Companies bringing the suits say they are defending the rewards due those who develop innovative software from companies that are selling cut rate copies 
48fc0309 But others argue that new software always borrows from the old 
48fc030a They say Lotus if its suit succeeds will stifle innovation and discourage the spread of standards that help computer users master software made by different companies

48fc030k Political observers theorize that the political rehabilitation is linked to this invisible presidential race 
48fc030l Some say for instance that Mr\. de la Madrid put the former minister on display to goad other candidates into working harder 
48fc030m Others suggest that one presidential hopeful is using the popular Mr\. Silva Herzog to undermine his rivals 
48fc030n The most provocative hypothesis has it that Mr\. Silva Herzog has himself become a candidate again 
48fc030o We are aware of our international obligations and we willingly accept them the banker observes 
48fc030p But the Bundesbank he asserts has to be very cautious in setting its monetary policy

48fc030r Mr\. Wright didn\'t list those earnings on nineteen eighty seven personal financial disclosure forms 
48fc030s Attorney Daniel Swillinger said at a minimum he should have disclosed this the six thousand and five hundred dollar escrow as an asset 
48fc030t Mr\. Swillinger counseled Representative Newt Gingrich Republican of Georgia on the drafting of a complaint against Mr\. Wright that helped touch off the ethics investigation 
48fc030u The one element of suspense remains the selection of a running mate for Vice President Bush\'s presidential campaign 
48fc030v Bush managers insist they won\'t disclose the vice presidential nominee\'s identity until Thursday morning 
48fc030w Reagan arrived at the convention site last night and prepared for his farewell speech to the party tonight 
48fc030x The president leaves for California tomorrow and Bush will arrive to take control of the convention

48fc030z The decision to interrupt the Olympic coverage could mean a potential advertising revenue loss of eight million dollars according to Michael Gartner president of N\. B\. C\. News 
48fc0310 The debates wouldn\'t be interrupted by ads 
48fc0311 After some second guessing on their earlier decision to skip the presidential debate Mr\. Gartner said network officials changed their minds yesterday

48fc0317 We have a recession but many people are rich 
48fc0318 If you have a house and pictures you want a horse an Arabian horse 
48fc0319 Exactly like America 
48fc031a If you don\'t have an Arabian horse you cannot meet Mr\. Armand Hammer 
48fc031b If you have an Arabian horse he is your friend 
48fc031c [tongue_click] When the House and Senate approved the tax bill early Saturday lawmakers didn\'t mention the last minute provisions and congressional staffers described them as technical 
48fc031d While the estimated revenue of almost one hundred million dollars over three years is relatively small [loud_breath] the provisions might be perceived as an anti takeover push by Congress 
48fc031e They could have the effect of slowing certain takeover activity congressional sources acknowledged over the weekend 
48fc031f To be sure on a lot of scores the summit was a success 
48fc031g Economic cooperation was advanced with businessmen signing agreements for about thirty contracts and several joint ventures 
48fc031h Human rights too may have taken a step forward if Mr\. Gorbachev lives up to his promise to release all political prisoners by year\'s end

48fc0408 Both the Nasdaq and Amex indexes surpassed records set Wednesday 
48fc0409 U\. S\. bank regulations are another stumbling block 
48fc040a Currently banks can\'t own more than nineteen \.POINT nine \%PERCENT of a non financial company and can only be passive investors 
48fc040b Unless these restrictions are dropped banks are likely to be swapping mainly for equity in financial institutions 
48fc040c Those aren\'t always appealing or even available 
48fc040d Mexico nationalized its banks five years ago 
48fc040e [tongue_click] And in Brazil central bank figures show that one out of every seven bank loans is past due eight times the delinquency rate of a year earlier 
48fc040f The stock split will be distributed on or about July second to holders of record on June twenty sixth 
48fc040g After the dividend the company will have about seven \.POINT eight million shares outstanding 
48fc040h The company said it will discontinue paying the previous regular quarterly cash dividend of fifteen cents a share after the stock dividend is paid to conserve cash for future acquisitions 
48fc040i The cash dividend last was paid May fifteenth

48fc040m Burmah a British oil company and S\. H\. V\. a Dutch energy concern said they would proceed with their offer only if Calor endorsed the bid 
48fc040n [tongue_click] A spokesman for Burmah said that the proposal made yesterday was final and that Burmah and S\. H\. V\. wouldn\'t contemplate a hostile offer 
48fc040o He also ruled out the possibility that Burmah might launch a bid on its own 
48fc040p Ivan Toms isn\'t in a festive mood as he contemplates his impending confrontation with the military 
48fc040q I know it will be horrific he says staring down at his lunch but it is important to take this stand 
48fc040r I think individuals can make a difference 
48fc040s The budget however will not manage itself 
48fc040t Some way must be found to put it on course 
48fc040u In our history an impasse over policy has been broken occasionally by some sort of national commission and it is time for one again 
48fc040v Such a commission resolved the Social Security problem earlier in this decade 
48fc040w In the Johnson years a commission\'s proposals were the means for restructuring the budget 
48fc040x Still earlier it was a commission that recommended the creation of the Federal Reserve System 
48fc040y This approach enables the president and members of Congress to avoid some flak by merely implementing what the commission told us to do 
48fc040z Thus the board said it would be reluctant to give Bank of New York more than one extension of the initial ninety days to consummate the merger 
48fc0410 Normally extensions of the ninety day rule are granted freely 
48fc0411 But in the pending merger the board wants to avoid a long and fruitless struggle said Michael Bradfield the Fed\'s general counsel 
48fc0412 One of the more direct readings on inflation will come in Friday\'s report on consumer prices which are expected not surprisingly to be higher 
48fc0413 Analysts expect an increase of about four tenths of a \%PERCENT in the April consumer price index on the heels of a five tenths of a \%PERCENT jump the previous month 
48fc0414 The price increases are expected pretty much across the board as commodities and services are rising at about a four \%PERCENT annual rate 
48fc0415 But there is always the risk that reviving a classic slogan or spokesman will backfire and create an old fashioned image for a brand 
48fc0416 To guard against that marketers tend to give their recycled ads a contemporary twist 
48fc0417 The Captain Raid of nineteen eighty eight for example has rippling muscles and a futuristic look 
48fc0418 And a woman in one of the new Nestea spots doesn\'t just tumble into a swimming pool she falls onto an exercise mat that turns into a pool 
48fc0419 [tongue_click] Prices at the mass retail level however haven\'t risen much in a decade partly because big retailers use tennis balls to lure shoppers 
48fc041a I remember purchasing a can of balls for two dollars in nineteen sixty seven says Walter L\. Henry a Pittsburgh recreational player 
48fc041b Two weeks ago I picked up a can for a dollar eighty nine 
48fc041c Reacting to a wave of labor unrest the Communist government announced the special August thirty first session would review economic policies and perhaps adjust national price and income policies 
48fc041d The interior minister said at least twenty strikes have broken out and authorities extended a curfew and detained forty nine people nationwide

48gc0201 A smaller market share still means substantial growth when the asset pool is vastly expanded [loud_breath] notes George Collins president of T\. Rowe Price 
48gc0202 [tongue_click] Nonetheless the firm has been paying more attention to the consumer aspects of the business 
48gc0203 Retail clients currently account for about fifty seven \%PERCENT of the total twenty two billion dollars of assets under management at T\. Rowe Price 
48gc0204 In nineteen seventy eight retail business accounted for about thirty five \%PERCENT of the firm\'s assets 
48gc0205 Already arbitragers estimate industrywide losses in the takeover stock sell off that followed the Boesky news at between one billion dollars and two billion dollars 
48gc0206 [tongue_click] Some say a few of their colleagues lost the entire year\'s profit in the week after the Boesky announcement November fourteenth 
48gc0207 [loud_breath] Others watched glumly as their annual bonuses withered along with the prices of takeover stocks 
48gc0208 London\'s one hundred share index fell eight \.POINT six points to close at two thousand two hundred and seventy five its low for the day

48gc020c Frankfurt shares tumbled in response to the weaker dollar and the decline on Wall Street Wednesday brokers said 
48gc020d Many blue chip issues lost as much as two \%PERCENT with a few dropping as much as four \%PERCENT 
48gc020e Financial shares were hit hardest amid fears of higher interest rates 
48gc020f Inevitably some will seek a fourth alternative to continue borrowing from the rest of the world making only marginal adjustments in our economic policies 
48gc020g Earlier this century the British taught us that debt and leadership cannot long co exist 
48gc020h Eventually and the markets seem to be saying sooner rather than later we will have to choose 
48gc020i We saw it with oil and we\'re seeing it with gold says John Dessauer an Orleans Massachusetts money manager 
48gc020j When the price gets high enough all these new reserves open up eventually knocking down prices he says 
48gc020k He adds that he expects gold will soon retreat to below four hundred dollars 
48gc020l [loud_breath] Articles began appearing about the rise of the religious right a group that seemed to be dealt with more as anthropology than journalism 
48gc020m [loud_breath] After watching evangelical T\. V\. ministers Norman Lear began spending his fortune on a group called People for the American Way 
48gc020n [loud_breath] Much of this swamp creature treatment came to a head in the nineteen eighty six lawsuits [loud_breath] over creationism and secular humanism in school texts

48gc020t [loud_breath] The alliance issued a communique that stressed its determination to decide on a comprehensive approach to further arms control treaties 
48gc020u But it sidestepped decisions on divisive issues such as modernizing the short range nuclear weapons based in n- West Germany 
48gc020v [loud_breath] Unfair or not the questions are being asked about both the revolution\'s route and its goals How much violence will there be 
48gc020w Will whites have political rights 
48gc020x How many whites will lose their jobs 
48gc020y How Communist is the A\. N\. C\. 
48gc020z How much will the government control the economy 
48gc0210 [tongue_click] In January signs of a weakening economy prompted Chairman Greenspan and Vice Chairman Johnson to push through a slight easing of policy allowing interest rates to fall 
48gc0211 Governor Angell worried by the strong commodity prices was reluctant to go along 
48gc0212 And several district bank presidents later bristled because they weren\'t consulted 
48gc0213 The rehabilitation process is certainly further along 
48gc0214 There\'s less looking back and more looking forward now Mr\. LeFevre said [other_mouth_sound] 
48gc0215 People are focusing more on the election and the post election period what it might mean for the economy 
48gc0216 Analysts and franchises alike pointed to what they regarded as an about face on Burger King by Pillsbury\'s new chairman and chief executive officer Philip L\. Smith 
48gc0217 In his maiden speech to Pillsbury shareholders on September thirteenth Mr\. Smith said reviving the chain was his top priority 
48gc0218 He called it one of Pillsbury\'s best opportunites for growth 
48gc0219 Moreover fiercely competitive organizations often shy away from courtroom confrontations over business tactics because of questions of image 
48gc021a The macho mentality of many corporate board rooms disdains defamation suits because they make a company look whiny says Mr\. Hanson 
48gc021b Most companies he says are afraid to look as if they can\'t take the competition 
48gc021c [loud_breath] An Upjohn spokeswoman said the company planned to market Rogaine to women all along 
48gc021d However F\. D\. A\. approval for using the drug on men came first because Upjohn didn\'t test the product on enough women initially 
48gc021e Upjohn said it began testing Rogaine on women in nineteen eighty seven about four years after tests on balding men began 
48gc0301 Like their economies the currencies of the U\. S\. and Canada are closely related 
48gc0302 But as interest rates rise in Canada the Canadian dollar is gaining on its U\. S\. counterpart traders and analysts say 
48gc0303 And as the Canadian unit rises it lures more foreign investment particularly from Japan which adds to its strength 
48gc0304 The Treasury rules however contain modifications of the S\. E\. C\. rules designed to improve protection of parties involved in repurchase agreements 
48gc0305 In such agreements called repos one party sells government securities to another with the understanding that the seller will repurchase them later at a specified price 
48gc0306 [loud_breath] The proposed modifications would apply to government securities brokers or dealers that are already registered as well as to newly registered entities 
48gc0307 [loud_breath] Nevertheless interest rates fell on short term Treasury bills sold yesterday at the government\'s weekly auction 
48gc0308 The average rate on new thirteen week bills declined to five \.POINT five nine \%PERCENT from five \.POINT eight one \%PERCENT at last week\'s sale 
48gc0309 The average rate on new twenty six week bills fell to five \.POINT nine nine \%PERCENT from six \.POINT one \%PERCENT the previous week

48gc030k Foul weather was also blamed by a spokesman for Pan Am the first place finisher in December 
48gc030l Weather particularly affected flights in the Northeast and Europe where most of Pan Am\'s routes are located he said 
48gc030m [footsteps/] He added that Pan Am [/footsteps] nonetheless turned in one of the best performances among major carriers 
48gc030n He predicted the next report will show a rebound for the airline in February 
48gc030o To be sure a few companies are trying to use the Olympics to make the transition from a *subcontractor* to an internationally known brand 
48gc030p Kukje Corporation shifted from producing Nike shoes to developing its own Pro Specs line of athletic shoes five years ago 
48gc030q It paid four \.POINT five million dollars in cash and goods to be an official sponsor of the games and has been highlighting the logo in its advertising 
48gc030r Kukje hopes the Olympics will help give Pro Specs a foothold in Europe 
48gc030s Viewers and critics say the huge load of ads and airtime is part of the problem 
48gc030t Commercial clutter seems greater than in previous Olympics broadcasts many critics say 
48gc030u The coverage between ads some complain is fragmented and shifty jumping too quickly among myriad sports 
48gc030v Actual events as opposed to taped profiles previews and reports take up less than half of the airtime 
48gc030w Many headline events don\'t appear until after midnight 
48gc030x The study was part of Cornell\'s response to calls by local politicians that it should help more in Tompkins County 
48gc030y When the schools were ranked by operating budget or value of buildings Cornell\'s one \.POINT two million dollar payments were found to be near the bottom of the list 
48gc030z In per student payments Cornell ranked seventh at seventy dollars 
48gc0310 [tongue_click] Mr\. Delchamps said thirty \%PERCENT of the company\'s stock outstanding is held by people who have agreed not to sell their holdings before October thirty first 
48gc0311 Another twenty five \%PERCENT is held under the company\'s employee stock ownership plan 
48gc0312 Most of the people in the former category are expected to extend the no sell agreement for another year he said 
48gc0313 The lower volatility could be especially important right now when the course of interest rates seems especially cloudy 
48gc0314 [loud_breath] While interest rates have been declining recently many economists expect rates to rise by year end 
48gc0315 After that however they say rates could fall again perhaps sharply as economic growth slows in nineteen eighty nine

48gc0319 [tongue_click] In April Drexel agreed to pay six hundred and fifty million dollars and plead guilty to six felony counts related to a federal insider trading investigation 
48gc031a [tongue_click] The plea agreement was made in conjunction with a broad settlement of securities law violations with the Securities and Exchange Commission 
48gc031b Because the firm agreed that it committed felonies securities commissioners in most states can automatically revoke Drexel\'s license to do business 
48gc031c Why this incredible diversion of effort to crimes that often are not clearly defined by statute and where identifiable victims are seldom found 
48gc031d Maybe too many of today\'s prosecutors were influenced by the prevailing counterculture suspicions of middle class morality during their law school days 
48gc031e [loud_breath] But another answer is simpler It is easier to extract plea bargains from traders with a mere mention of R\. I\. C\. O\. than from real felons 
48gc0401 As a longtime member of the Anaheim California

48gc0406 [loud_breath] It was the Big Board\'s most active issue 
48gc0407 During the past several days corporations and other big investors have refrained from lending Treasury bonds and notes to securities dealers for brief periods 
48gc0408 That in turn has forced many dealers to refrain from selling borrowed securities or amassing so called short positions 
48gc0409 It\'s hard to short anything in this market at the moment said a trader at a large government securities dealer

48hc0203 The company\'s bankruptcy case lawyer in Philadelphia wasn\'t available for comment 
48hc0204 [loud_breath] Mr\. Shlenker couldn\'t be reached 
48hc0205 Because of that some Wall Street professionals think that the stock looks rather expensive 
48hc0206 It has tripled since nineteen eighty five largely on takeover speculation 
48hc0207 [loud_breath] It currently trades at about nine times cash flow says Alan Gaines of Gaines Berland an institutional brokerage firm 
48hc0208 [tongue_click] That\'s about a thirty \%PERCENT premium to quality oil companies like . Royal Dutch Petroleum Exxon and Mobil he says 
48hc0209 [tongue_click] To these ends K\. P\. C\. enjoys a huge economic advantage 
48hc020a It costs Kuwait about a dollar to pump a barrel of oil and another fifty cents to bring it to Europe 
48hc020b The production cost of North Sea oil by contrast runs between eight dollars and thirteen dollars a barrel 
48hc020c [tongue_click] The big difference disturbs European oil men 
48hc020d The question was what form this conflict would take 
48hc020e The Civil War was finally fought over maintaining the Union 
48hc020f But what if there had been no Union 
48hc020g What if the South had been a separate nation 
48hc020h Would Southerners black or white have ever achieved full equality if they had been incorporated into the union as a conquered province 
48hc020i Or what if the war had been avoided and slavery just drifted on and on 
48hc020j Would the South have become another South Africa 
48hc020k I wouldn\'t bet against it 
48hc020l [loud_breath] It still isn\'t clear what form the increases will take [loud_breath] or when they will go into effect 
48hc020m [tongue_click] Some carriers said they plan to raise fares Sunday and others said they will act a week later

48hc0210 In the year ago quarter Texas Commerce had a loss of thirteen \.POINT five million which included a special charge from the restructuring 
48hc0211 Chemical acquired Texas Commerce in May nineteen eighty seven 
48hc0212 [tongue_click] The Richmond Virginia media concern said sales and profits from its newsprint operations were ahead of year earlier levels 
48hc0213 Its cable system continued to gain subscribers [loud_breath] now totaling more than one hundred and fifty seven thousand 
48hc0214 Revenue per subscriber is exceeding forecasts Media General said adding that it plans to increase rates an average of eight \%PERCENT in January 
48hc0215 Prices gradually moving higher through midafternoon when the market peaked and then started its retreat 
48hc0216 Philip Puccio manager of institutional trading at Dillon Read and Company said some institutions used the advance as an opportunity to do some selling 
48hc0217 [sniff] They\'ve been peeling off some stock to take advantage of better prices he said 
48hc0218 During the spring and summer the Fed nudged up short term interest rates to restrain the economy 
48hc0219 But worried as always about becoming a political football [loud_breath] the Fed tried to keep a low profile in the weeks before the election 
48hc021a That strategy was helped by an apparent slowdown in economic growth in the third quarter which eased inflation worries and allowed the Fed to stop pushing up rates 
48hc021b [loud_breath] In the year earlier quarter the La Jolla California industrial and investment concern had a restated loss of fifty seven million 
48hc021c [tongue_click] The results were restated to reflect discontinued operations and the consolidation of its Signal Landmark Holdings Incorporated unit a real estate developer 
48hc021d Revenue for the latest quarter rose sixty one \%PERCENT to four hundred and seven million from two hundred and fifty three million

48hc0306 It closed yesterday at thirty nine and seven eighths up one eighth 
48hc0307 Some have characterized our countermeasures as protectionist brought about because of congressional pressures 
48hc0308 That is dead wrong 
48hc0309 [loud_breath] We have been in consultations with Japan on this issue since November long before the l- present trade legislation was introduced 
48hc030a The president\'s action was the culmination of that process and it had nothing whatsoever to do with trade bills 
48hc030b [tongue_click] President Reagan believes that people and nations should honor their obligations 
48hc030c [tongue_click] There is nothing protectionist about that 
48hc030d Such cost cutting efforts have worsened labor disputes which have in turn pitted non union pilots against pro union pilots 
48hc030e [tongue_click] First Officer Guy Casey was once a captain at Continental [loud_breath] but lost his seniority during the bitter strike there in nineteen eighty three which he had helped to organize 
48hc030f He says he wants to put the experience behind him 
48hc030g Analysts also said they hadn\'t expected lower operating profits for the company\'s Industries Group and for the broadcasting segment 
48hc030h [tongue_click] Westinghouse officials told *analysts* that operating profit in the Industries Group fell fifteen to twenty \%PERCENT hurt in part by weak results in Canadian operations 
48hc030i A sharp drop in operating profit from the Broadcasting Group\'s production company contributed to the slightly lower operating earnings overall for that segment 
48hc030j The spokesman also said the league\'s owners are committed to playing with their current replacement rosters for the rest of the season including the Super Bowl if necessary

48hc030s Mr\. Timbers says he\'s fairly ambivalent ab:out the price of gold near term 
48hc030t He does see however higher inflation of five \%PERCENT or so in nineteen eighty nine up from four \%PERCENT this year 
48hc030u A gold option could be a nice alternative for fixed income investors should inf:lation fears arise Mr\. Timbers says 
48hc030v [tongue_click] Some economists say inflationary pressures could continue to push up U\. S\. interest rates this year 
48hc030w [tongue_click] If so foreign central banks may see that as an opportunity to tighten up and to address their own inflation worries despite U\. S\. concern 
48hc030x One fear says Irving Trust economist Robert McGee is that higher global rates will send the financial markets into a tailspin 
48hc030y [tongue_click] A similar view is held by Greta E\. Marshall investment manager of the California Public Employees\' Retirement System which manages about forty four \.POINT four billion dollars 
48hc030z I still see no evidence that inflation is picking up substantially she says 
48hc0310 [tongue_click] The economy doesn\'t look so strong [loud_breath] that it will rekindle inflation so I would view any further drop in bond prices as a buying opportunity 
48hc0311 [loud_breath] Alas they probably should have devoted a little more thought to Winnebago\'s past

48hc0318 [tongue_click] After nearly eight years of the Reagan presidency a kind of morning after mood prevails here 
48hc0319 There is a sense that Mr\. Reagan\'s successor hasn\'t any choice but to be a consolidation president 
48hc031a Given budget constraints and a re energized Congress some here believe a Bush administration may not be all that different from a Dukakis administration 
48hc031b Some of that cash has been used for bonus payments 
48hc031c Wages and bonuses rose nineteen \%PERCENT in the first half a rate that far outpaced economic growth and exerted upward pressure on prices

48hc0404 [tongue_click] The banks sought to eliminate a mismatch between their assets predominantly held in non pound currencies and their capital kept in pounds 
48hc0405 When the pound was weak during the early nineteen eighties the value of Scandinavian Bank\'s capital fell steeply in proportion to its non dollar assets 
48hc0406 The banks that owned Scandinavian Bank had to inject about forty seven \.POINT seven million dollars of additional capital 
48hc0407 Also the strong rise in share prices in recent weeks appears to have discounted most of the good news likely in the budget another dealer said 
48hc0408 It is going to take quite a lot to move it sharply ahead from this level he said 
48hc0409 The one hundred share index is up eighteen \.POINT six \%PERCENT this year 
48hc040a The book he says will be about Arvida and generally about companies snared in the takeover game 
48hc040b It will ask some pointed questions Is there value added in corporate mergers

48ic0306 This will ultimately give them more buying opportunities down the line 
48ic0307 The nineteen seventy two A\. B\. M\. treaty requires a review every five years 
48ic0308 Communiques announcing completion of the first and second reviews were issued on November fourth nineteen seventy seven and November ninth nineteen eighty two 
48ic0309 The third review was due by October third nineteen eighty seven 
48ic030a The most optimistic estimates are now that it will start sometime after the first of the year 
48ic030b The Reagan administration in short is conspiring with the Soviets to violate the review provisions of the treaty 
48ic030c No one seems quite sure how the publisher juggles his assets among his various companies which include the publicly owned Maxwell Communications Corporation and various private ones 
48ic030d Control of the public company and of private interests like Mirror Group Newspapers Limited rests with a foundation in Liechtenstein . Pergamon Holding Foundation about which little is disclosed 
48ic030e He says its beneficiaries are charities which he promises to identify someday soon 
48ic030f The optimism is widespread the association said fifty seven \%PERCENT predicted nineteen eighty eight will be better than nineteen eighty seven while only thirteen expected a worse year that is the highest total to forcast a better future year in nineteen 
48ic030g The association said fifty seven \%PERCENT predicted nineteen eighty eight will be better than nineteen eighty seven while only thirteen \%PERCENT expected a worse year 
48ic030h That is the highest total to forecast a better future year in December since nineteen eighty three when eighty six \%PERCENT were expecting stronger growth 
48ic030i President Reagan who was in Durham North Carolina was cautious about the Soviet offer 
48ic030j I\'m waiting to see what the conditions are he said 
48ic030k A senior administration official however called the Gorbachev statement a watershed event because it will increase expectations among . Soviet people for withdrawal 
48ic030l Regardless of how the foreign purchases begin they o- often involve the very parts that make weapons perform 
48ic030m For example F\. M\. C\. Corporation\'s Bradley Fighting Vehicle depends on a sophisticated sensor system from the Netherlands to inform soldiers of potential threats and targets 
48ic030n Without this part tucked into the turret of the armored vehicle the Bradley would be comparatively helpless on the battlefield 
48ic030o Mr\. Iacocca said that while the pricing actions increased sales they also squeezed Chrysler\'s profit margins 
48ic030p But he added that the Number three U\. S\. auto maker made a conscious decision to sacrifice profit for a higher market share 
48ic030q That move is behind Chrysler\'s recent decisions to increase production which in turn will boost profit for the rest of the year 
48ic030r The Cuomo plan doesn\'t stop at gouging New York taxpayers and Long Island ratepayers 
48ic030s Federal taxpayers also will contribute 
48ic030t The key to the deal is that Lilco also would get a two \.POINT five billion tax write off for Shoreham 
48ic030u This would guarantee that the utility won\'t have to pay any federal taxes for at least a decade 
48ic030v New York also would help Lilco float a hundred million in tax exempt industrial development bonds to help pay for the cleanup 
48ic030w Make that de industrialization bonds 
48ic030x But network officials will spend months debating C\. B\. S\.\'s wisdom 
48ic030y It\'s time to be aggressive said Mr\. Wilson testily taking on reporters at yesterday\'s press conference 
48ic030z I\'m up here stating C\. B\. S\. has acquired the rights and N\. B\. C\. hasn\'t 
48ic0310 At N\. B\. C\. Mr\. Watson was philosophic if pragmatic You always want to be a winner he said 
48ic0311 But you don\'t want to commit suicide at the same time 
48ic0312 The total cut would correspond to the amount of coffee sold and not exceed eighteen thousand bags 
48ic0313 One bag equals sixty kilos 
48ic0314 The annual global export quota is fifty four \.POINT five million bags 
48ic0315 In another trade dispute Kansai International Airport Corporation has come under attack 
48ic0316 Japan insists the company which is in charge of a new airport at Osaka is private and not subject to ministry orders 
48ic0317 Foreigners say that is a semantic argument because nearly four fifths of the company\'s executives hail from government ministries 
48ic0318 Three years ago when the Moslem League came into the shared power arrangement Mr\. Ijaz Ali got into the provincial assembly 
48ic0319 There he wrung thousands of rupees from the government to build roads schools and electrification systems in his district 
48ic031a The government\'s idea was to outflank the P\. P\. P\. opposition through public works 
48ic031b Directly and indirectly the army plays an *incalculable* role in keeping Pakistan\'s distorted economy perking 
48ic031c Mr\. Jones the author notes that five hundred thousand Pakistani households four \%PERCENT of the economy active ones have sent young men into the army 
48ic031d Add in the households involved in services for the military and nearly ten \%PERCENT of the nation\'s households are involved 
48ic031e U\. S\. intelligence about the terrorists is considered poor 
48ic031f It has proven difficult to infiltrate small terrorist cells which often are held together by family relationships 
48ic031g And during the nineteen eighties Lebanese terrorists killed two of the Central Intelligen(ce)- Agency\'s top Middle East operatives Robert Ames and William Buckley 
48ic0401 As modest as the measures are even they won\'t be adopted without a struggle 
48ic0402 The tax cuts accepted by the coalition parties have been linked to cutbacks in federal subsidies 
48ic0403 Such reductions could rile special interest groups and undermine parliamentary support for the entire tax program 
48ic0404 Moreover any tax reform must clear parliament\'s upper house . the Bundesrat . where the ruling Christian Democratic Union clings to a majority 
48ic0405 Some banks have already re- turned certain debts into securities which so far they have held rather than selling 
48ic0406 To get around Japanese government limits on debt reserves a group of Japanese banks turned some Third World debt into preferred stock earlier this year 
48ic0407 And Shearson is about to start marketing a mutual fund to banks that would allow the banks to swap Philippine debt for equity investments in that country 
48ic0408 The Japanese stock market is awash with liquidity Mr\. Grant says 
48ic0409 But in June suddenly with no apparent drainage it went down and kept going down he says 
48ic040a What is a mystery to Mr\. Grant and many others is that the Tokyo market has since staged a vigorous rebound 
48ic040b The Philip Morris magazine enjoys by far the highest circulation of any company magazine seven \.POINT two million copies 
48ic040c The only requirement is that you have to be an adult to receive the magazine says Mary Taylor associate publisher 
48ic040d That\'s not because of racy articles but because the tobacco industry has been accused of trying to snatch twelve and thirteen year olds 
48ic040e Philip Morris is even considering selling space to outside advertisers it already ran an ad for Time magazine on a test basis in its winter nineteen eighty seven issue 
48ic040f Non U\. S\. borrowers also reportedly may come to the market 
48ic040g [beep] The Republic of Austria may launch a long dated . Euroyen issue . perhaps totaling eighty billion yen which is six hundred twenty two million 
48ic040h Japan Finance Corporation for Municipal Enterprises is expected to announce a seven year issue that may total two hundred million early today 
48ic040i Mitsui and Company has a minority stake in a leveraged buy out fund that acquired control of Joseph Horne Corporation in late nineteen eighty six 
48ic040j A chart in an earlier edition incorrectly listed Mitsui its role and the date of the transaction 
48ic040k In addition the chart omitted several large recent Japanese acquisitions because of production error 
48ic040l The United Nations whose garbage bill is forty two thousand a month is served by National Carting Company which won the pickup rights eight years ago 
48ic040m Last December the United Nations didn\'t attempt to solicit bids 
48ic040n It simply extended its contract with National Carting 
48ic040o Soliciting bids in this particular industry is not the way to go a United Nations spokesman . says implying that it is futile 
48ic040p A big part of the reason for wood\'s success is the new techniques developed over the past five years for wood panels with a steel core 
48ic040q Besides narrowing the price difference between wood and metal systems these techniques provided the precision needed in designing panel systems that must fit together 
48ic040r Almost all the major office furniture manufacturers have acquired the ability to make wood systems in recent years 
48ic040s Still there are ways around the no documents dilemma 
48ic040t Says Davis Dyer a Winthrop Group managing director My first stop is to go to the factory and say Who is the buff 
48ic040u There\'s always a buff 
48ic040v In one case he found an employee who had saved every copy of the company\'s in house magazine for twenty five years 
48ic040w The whole environment has changed he says 
48ic040x We have a lot more options than we did before 
48ic040y He\'s planning on spending seven million on advertising and promotion this year compared with a couple of million dollars in the past

48ic0411 One of the four businesses included in the lockup option granted to K\. K\. R\. in Macmillan\'s directory division which consists of Who\'s Who and National Register Publishing 
48ic0412 Thus it wasn\'t immediately clear why International Thomson might be looking at the operation even though it is included in the lockup option 
48ic0413 A spokesman for K\. K\. R\. also declined to comment 
48ic0414 Last year after world stock prices crashed the market for domestic Japanese convertible bonds fell briefly 
48ic0415 By the start of this year convertible issues with a par value of more than four trillion yen were trading at below their issue price 
48ic0416 They quickly recovered though thanks to a boom in the stock market and the relatively relaxed rate of new convertible bond issues 
48ic0417 The U\. S\. has been asking Damascus for help but the results have been disappointing 
48ic0418 We\'re just a little bit exasperated says a senior U\. S\. official

48ic041a Aviation insurance is under intense pressure 
48ic041b The global airline premiums have dropped to about four hundred million from about one billion in nineteen eighty seven 
48ic041c Meanwhile airline losses in nineteen eighty eight rose significantly from the previous year 
48jc0201 [tongue_click] [loud_breath] At this point competing developers were eyeing the project 
48jc0202 Under its ground lease with the city and state the partnership might be found in default of its contract enabling a competing developer to take over 
48jc0203 To stave off an attack Mr\. Harrison says Our position was that we were never in default on our lease 
48jc0204 We maintain that the bank stopped funding 
48jc0205 I\'m positive on the move to his new post Mr\. Rhines said 
48jc0206 I grew up in the semiconductor group

48jc0208 The F\. C\. C\. rejected petitions from several parties maintaining that stations should be sold to someone with closer ties to the Hispanic community than Hallmark 
48jc0209 [loud_breath] Hallmark however has said it would continue these stations in the Spanish language format 
48jc020a The F\. C\. C\. said the concerns over future programming were irrelevant to the transfer

48jc020c His eyebrows arch once again 
48jc020d What do we do 
48jc020e Robert McClements Junior chairman and chief executive officer said Sun continues to seek an acquisition that will provide the right mix of assets 
48jc020f A spokesman for the company said Sun is looking for something large in the area of energy reserves 
48jc020g [loud_breath] The spokesman said Sun has more than one billion in capital that it has gained from spinoffs and divestitures of companies over the past several years 
48jc020h No final budget decisions have been made at the White House 
48jc020i Budget drafting is behind schedule and federal agencies won\'t even see O\. M\. B\. recommendations until late this week

48jc020r First Interstate\'s fourth quarter loss resulted from a previously announced one hundred and eighty million addition to its reserves against possible foreign debt losses 
48jc020s But even without the reserves the company said earnings would have been flat at about eighty five million compared with the year earlier quarter 
48jc020t [loud_breath] First Interstate had a slight decline in earnings assets and negligible growth in net interest income 
48jc020u [loud_breath] Net interest income fell seventeen \%PERCENT partly because year earlier results included a nineteen \.POINT six million [loud_breath] pretax gain on the sale of a building 
48jc020v [loud_breath] Pillsbury\'s loss compares with earnings of forty eight \.POINT five million or fifty six cents a share in the year earlier quarter 
48jc020w Revenue fell two \%PERCENT in the latest period to one \.POINT five oh billion from one \.POINT five three billion 
48jc020x The revenue decline came from Pillsbury\'s restaurant business 
48jc020y [loud_breath] That\'s a business decision that the manager has to make Mr\. Keane says 
48jc020z It\'s going to affect his return 
48jc0210 And in the long run the return will decide whether the manager stays in his job 
48jc0211 For hundreds of years the Kurds have struggled to establish an independent Kurdistan in a territory that straddles parts of Turkey Iraq and Iran 
48jc0212 Like the Palestinians the world\'s twenty million Kurds share a religion a culture a language and a passion for autonomy 
48jc0213 Nearly half live in Turkey which refuses even to recognize them as a distinct national minority and refers to them only as mountain Turks 
48jc0214 Though the Kurds outnumber the Palestinians by a ratio of five to one the Kurdish cause has attracted little global attention

48jc0218 One of the four businesses included in the lockup option granted to K\. K\. R\. [loud_breath] is Macmillan\'s dictionary division which consists of Who\'s Who and National Register Publishing 
48jc0219 Thus it wasn\'t immediately clear why International Thomson might be looking at the operation even though it is included in the lockup option 
48jc021a A spokesman for K\. K\. R\. also declined comment 
48jc021b O\. T\. C\. brokers also stress that their stocks often outperform listed ones [loud_breath] on a long term basis 
48jc021c [tongue_click] [loud_breath] And overall the Nasdaq Composite Index is up thirteen \%PERCENT this year [loud_breath] twice as much as the Dow Jones Industrial Average 
48jc021d Also they note the tiny stocks that generally trade under three dollars a share have always taken big percentage moves up or down when they move at all 
48jc021e The most widely used estrogen product in the U\. S\. is sold under the brand name Premarin [loud_breath] by American Home Products Corporation\'s Wyeth Ayerst Laboratories 
48jc021f [loud_breath] In nineteen eighty eight sales of Premarin largely to prevent osteoporosis jumped twenty six \%PERCENT to two hundred and thirty six million

48jc0304 [loud_breath] When the market was roaring it was stupid to have cash says the fund manager at a major Japanese trust bank 
48jc0305 But now it isn\'t so bad 
48jc0306 And Salomon\'s Mr\. Napier says Everyone is getting into cash right now and waiting 
48jc0307 Hours before the arguments begin lawyers and aides representing outside investors will begin circling 
48jc0308 They will stake out choice seats near the exit and plot escape routes to nearby telephones 
48jc0309 Once the hearing begins they will hang on the judge\'s every word 
48jc030a A French press report said the exports include sophisticated equipment for making semiconductors 
48jc030b It said the machinery may have helped the Soviets build advanced computer memories [loud_breath] for such military purposes as missile guidance

48jc030j When reminded of the role reversals Irving\'s Mr\. Rice says the fact that the merger talk never went further obviously shows there is no commonality 
48jc030k A spokesman for Mr\. Bacot says this A lot has happened in banking and the financial markets in the intervening years 
48jc030l The relevance of these comments to today\'s circumstances isn\'t very great 
48jc030m Mr\. Reagan vigorously defended Attorney General Edwin Meese who is under investigation for his role in advancing a Middle East oil pipeline [loud_breath] advocated by one of Mr\. Meese\'s friends 
48jc030n Mr\. Reagan said he couldn\'t remember being told anything about the pipeline [loud_breath] and expressed every confidence in Mr\. Meese\'s integrity 
48jc030o He also criticized the lynch mob atmosphere that has accompanied investigations of his aides 
48jc030p In two selected areas the state will allow procurement and retail prices to rise to what the open market demands 
48jc030q The subsidy for consumers is meant to reduce the strain on urban residents 
48jc030r Farmers of course will get higher prices for their grain from the market which in turn should induce them to increase production 
48jc030s Grain production throughout China has faltered in recent years in part because state procurement prices were too low 
48jc030t Meanwhile share prices closed higher in Sydney Hong Kong Wellington Seoul and Manila and were lower in Singapore 
48jc030u Trading was described as light to moderate 
48jc030v The Taipei market was closed 
48jc030w Grains and soybeans The threat of rain and favorable spring planting conditions pushed soybean and corn futures prices lower 
48jc030x The latest weather forecast calls for fairly good moisture in Midwest farming states over the next six to ten days 
48jc030y Analysts said traders are shifting their emphasis away from last year\'s crop [loud_breath] and to this year\'s 
48jc030z [tongue_click] [loud_breath] With this year\'s small acreage increases weather and spring planting conditions are major concerns to a market that is beginning to shake off a huge surplus 
48jc0310 The favorable conditions helped the soybean contract for November settlement close at six \.POINT eight two two five dollars a bushel down nine \.POINT five cents 
48jc0311 Another executive explains the problems as the opposite of nineteen eighty seven 
48jc0312 Last year you had tumultuous swings in the markets themselves he says 
48jc0313 This year the environment will be narrower swings but volume will be lower with revenues insufficient to cover costs 
48jc0314 [tongue_click] More important than arithmetic however is Mr\. Jackson\'s message 
48jc0315 Speaking to black aspirations he represents the best of the American dream 
48jc0316 He might even qualify as a social conservative if not for his endorsement of homosexual rights 
48jc0317 On the first day of the general strike factories closed but bookstores remained open in this old world cultural center 
48jc0318 Most schools were shut but Pushkin Street near the square reverberated as usual with the sound of badly played Chopin emanating from the open windows of the music academy 
48jc0319 [tongue_click] Many of the Armenian demands are cultural 
48jc031a They want their old flag reinstated their children sent to Armenian schools rather than Russian ones their own language used on official documents 
48jc031b Their political demands include calls for a separate army brigade and the right for Armenia to have consulates abroad 
48jc031c [tongue_click] [loud_breath] The study was part of Cornell\'s response to calls by local politicians [loud_breath] that it should help more in Tompkins County

48jc040a [tongue_click] [loud_breath] Still securities and banking regulators worry whether they are acting fast enough to safeguard against growing risks in the world\'s financial markets 
48jc040b Many agree there is little time to waste in the scramble to create better international regulation 
48jc040c As Mr\. Feldstein says You can\'t just look at the building and say it hasn\'t fallen down yet so we should be safe 
48jc040d With the initial financing complete L\. S\. I\. looked abroad in February nineteen eighty two for its next infusion 
48jc040e We decided to go to investors who\'d pay a higher price explains Mr\. Corrigan 
48jc040f At the time Europeans were clamoring to invest in U\. S\. high technology and had few opportunities to participate directly in good deals he says 
48jc040g [tongue_click] If we look at the record the debate should be rather short 
48jc040h The winners obvious 
48jc040i The only tragedy and it\'s an amazing one is that most Americans don\'t even know what has been accomplished and how it came about 
48jc040j But inside Room seven one three the Japanese see the situation somewhat differently 
48jc040k They reason like this If the U\. S\. imposes sanctions they most likely will be aimed at Japanese construction companies doing business in the U\. S\. 
48jc040l But that would hurt thousands of American workers who are employed either directly or indirectly by such companies 
48jc040m The political fallout for the Reagan administration might be too great to risk that

48jc040q [tongue_click] [loud_breath] Mr\. Tanaka was among the first scientists to recognize the potential of superconductors [loud_breath] which are substances that can carry electricity with no resistance and thus no loss of power 
48jc040r [loud_breath] If made practical they could bring spectacular changes to almost any electrical product or process 
48jc040s [loud_breath] That could mean vastly faster and more energy efficient products such as computers cars and household appliances 
48jc040t But until the recent breakthrough superconductors had to be chilled at a hopelessly low temperature to work so except for a few applications there really was no technology 
48jc040u Mr\. Iacocca said that while pricing actions increased sales they also squeezed Chrysler\'s profit margins 
48jc040v But he added that the Number three U\. S\. auto maker made a conscious decision to sacrifice profits for a higher market share 
48jc040w That move is behind Chrysler\'s recent decisions to increase production which in turn will boost profit for the rest of the year 
48jc040x [loud_breath] Critics agree that he may be overly optimistic though 
48jc040y And Mr\. Dukakis is certain to face more pressure on the question from *Vice* President Bush who supports both the M\. X\. and Midgetman 
48jc040z Moreover most of the members of Congress being considered as potential running mates for Governor Dukakis have backed one or more missile plans 
48jc0410 The defense authorization bill pending in Congress is expected to put off any decision to- until a new administration takes office next year 
48jc0411 Still Mr\. Love thinks he has the worst behind him 
48jc0412 Permian has bottomed out he says but he\'s using Intergroup\'s investment bankers to sound out prospective buyers anyway 
48jc0413 To bolster the balance sheet he\'s also attempting to reach agreement later this year to sell to Japan\'s N\. K\. K\. the other half of its steel holdings 
48jc0414 F\. P\. L\. said the acquisition would be accounted for as a pooling of interests

48kc020k In Atlantic City it took one hundred dollars to elbow into a Trump Plaza craps game the night of the Michael Spinks Gerry Cooney heavyweight fight in June 
48kc020l Many blackjack tables had a minimum bet of five hundred dollars 
48kc020m The result The amounts wagered that Monday night exceeded seven million dollars up from about one \.POINT five million for an average Monday 
48kc020n The survey\'s composite index fell to fifty eight \.POINT nine \%PERCENT in November from October\'s sixty one \.POINT eight \%PERCENT 
48kc020o A figure above fifty \%PERCENT indicates that the economy is generally expanding 
48kc020p November marks the sixteenth consecutive month of expansion 
48kc020q Trading this week may indicate the market\'s direction with the Dow Jones industrials near the October nineteenth low 
48kc020r Last week stock prices were sent tumbling by skittish investors many of whom are concerned with stagflation 
48kc020s Bond prices fell Friday 
48kc020t I think Mr\. 
48kc020u Tsai is probably torn between two goals building a world class financial company and making money personally says Martin Sosnoff of Atalanta Sosnoff Capital

48kc020w Britain\'s foreign secretary confirmed that British security forces killed three unarmed Irish Republican Army guerrillas Sunday in Gibraltar 
48kc020x [door_slam] Sir Geoffrey Howe said a terrorist act has been averted 
48kc020y The three two men and a woman reportedly were planning a bomb attack on a military parade today in the British colony 
48kc020z This may turn out to be an extremely positive development because all of the tobacco manufacturers were involved in the alleged conspiracy Mr\. Daynard said 
48kc0210 There is a lot of damning evidence 
48kc0211 Now the jury can consider almost all the evidence that came in about defendants\' attempts to stonewall and deny 
48kc0212 The flippers apparently waited the two weeks then dumped their shares when trading opened in the stock 
48kc0213 The flippers in the industry were hungrier to do this than expected an executive close to the deal says 
48kc0214 They were able to borrow money 
48kc0215 Analysts say there is a strong chance that Kao will take advantage of an earlier U\. S\. acquisition 
48kc0216 Last year it bought High Point North Carolina based High Point Chemical Corporation for an undisclosed sum

48kc021a He repeated his vow to stand for parliamentary elections expected later this year 
48kc021b Why not farmers respond 
48kc021c We haven\'t seen these prices before says David Gustafson an Eaton Colorado bean grower 
48kc021d He still has half of last year\'s harvest in storage even though he will start harvesting this year\'s crop this week 
48kc021e I wanted to speculate he explains 
48kc0301 While all West German political parties agreed on the need for tax cuts of about twenty two billion dollars they differ on who should benefit 
48kc0302 The Social Democrats and the left wing Greens want the cuts to help the poor [<door_slam] and the working class 
48kc0303 Within the ruling coalition the liberal Free Democrats and the Bavarian sister party of the Christian Democrats the Christian Socialists want cuts spread across the board 
48kc0304 Mr\. Funaro described as hot air and nonsense foreign bankers\' language in their criticism of Brazil\'s lack of economic policy 
48kc0305 He said nobody worried about Brazil\'s high inflation when the country was producing big surpluses to meet debt payments 
48kc0306 [cross_talk] Instead of looking for excuses he said these banks should realize there\'s a debt crisis and it has to be resolved by both sides 
48kc0307 Kidder Peabody was fined twenty five \.POINT three million dollars by the S\. E\. C\. to settle insider trading and other charges 
48kc0308 The penalty is second only to Ivan Boesky\'s one hundred million dollar fine last fall 
48kc0309 Kidder\'s settlement the first by a major firm in the insider trading scandal will allow the G\. E\. subsidiary to escape criminal prosecution 
48kc030a Even so Gloria has already given up hope 
48kc030b I hear that only people with money will be approved she says 
48kc030c My mother tells her it isn\'t true to be patient 
48kc030d The firm dollar also boosted prices in Zurich and encouraged selective buying by foreign and domestic investors dealers said 
48kc030e Some financial chemical and other industrial stocks had the biggest gains 
48kc030f Banks also ended mostly higher 
48kc030g Meanwhile Mr\. Silva Herzog borrowed a friend\'s unmarked office in central Mexico City and discreetly received visitors 
48kc030h He turned down job offers from companies and international lending agencies but accepted lecturing engagements abroad 
48kc030i He thought about opening a U\. S\. Latin America studies center in Mexico City or setting up a consulting firm 
48kc030j What happens now 
48kc030k That depends on two things whether management can gain the trust of the workers and whether union leaders can control the rank and file 
48kc030l It doesn\'t look good on either count 
48kc030m Indeed labor experts say there is only a slim chance that South Korea can lay a foundation for labor relations that might calm worker unrest soon 
48kc030n Turnout is another unknown factor 
48kc030o To capitalize here Governor Dukakis would like to see a heavy turnout especially in such pockets of strength as the Chicago lakefront and suburbs [cross_talk] 
48kc030p But that may not happen Illinois registration is below nineteen eighty four and no presidential candidate has yet caught fire

48kc030t We seem to be ready to take a little rest said one participant 
48kc030u I don\'t think people are either screamingly worried or screamingly excited about this market said another 
48kc030v I think the attitude has got to be that we\'ve been outperforming the other world markets and now the other markets may be outperforming this one a little 
48kc030w July platinum rose ten dollars and thirty cents an ounce to five hundred seventy seven dollars 
48kc030x July silver advanced eight \.POINT five cents an ounce to seven dollars and fifteen \.POINT five cents 
48kc030y August gold gained one dollar and twenty cents an ounce to four hundred and fifty five dollars and eighty cents 
48kc030z All three metals traded higher at various points in the day but late profit taking trimmed the advances 
48kc0310 But Mr\. Parcher is also considered abrasive at times 
48kc0311 He rubs some people wrong says Leonard Marks who has tried cases against him 
48kc0312 He\'s very outspoken 
48kc0313 [tongue_click] Lawrence Summers economic adviser to Governor Dukakis urges that even the best figures provide a discouraging picture of the economy 
48kc0314 It used to be that standards of living rose reliably he says referring to the nineteen fifties and nineteen sixties [misc_noise] 
48kc0315 But the pace in the nineteen eighties has been negative by my preferred measure and glacial by any other 
48kc0316 Still the neural network represents a remarkable conceptual leap in the computer world 
48kc0317 It is a critical building block in artificial intelligence much as the neurons in humans are the vehicle for brain function 
48kc0318 The network has allowed researchers to create the first convincing likeness of the brain in areas such as memory and vision 
48kc0319 Despite the problems with the Claridge Mr\. Wynn didn\'t rule out an eventual return to the Atlantic City gambling scene

48kc031b But this is a very lively market and we haven\'t given up yet 
48kc031c The Kremlin which long denied that there were political prisoners here now concedes they do exist 
48kc031d The most recent official Soviet estimates put the total between twelve and twenty nine 
48kc031e Moscow defines political prisoners as people sentenced under two articles of the Soviet criminal code that make behavior loosely defined as anti Soviet a criminal offense 
48kc031f Both articles of the code were widely used in locking up dissidents in the nineteen seventies 
48kc0401 [lip_smack] Ad agencies in the past have typically received as commissions fifteen \%PERCENT of an advertiser\'s billings the total cost of placing ads

48kc0404 The Diet is a one house legislature apportioned by district rather than population like the Senate as opposed to the House 
48kc0405 This means that Japanese farmers have tremendous control over Japanese politics 
48kc0406 Food prices in Japan take forty \%PERCENT or more of the average person\'s wage 
48kc0407 With housing taking another forty \%PERCENT and the fact that the Japanese are great savers they are left with almost no discretionary income 
48kc0408 This is why they cannot develop a domestic market 
48kc0409 They don\'t have money to spend except a small amount of savings that they spend only on special occasions or for unusual bargains 
48kc040a Cray already has sold two of the new computers 
48kc040b [misc_noise] All told Cray says it expects to sell four Y\. M\. P\.s this year and perhaps a dozen next year about as many as it can build 
48kc040c The government\'s Los Alamos National Laboratory confirmed it is buying the first machines to add to what a spokesman described as the world\'s most powerful scientific computing network 
48kc040d The laboratory bought the first Cray in nineteen seventy six 
48kc040e In addition Batus is expected this morning to file for approval of a takeover with insurance regulators in nine Western states where Farmers operates 
48kc040f [door_slam] Approval by all is considered necessary for a successful takeover the company\'s Wall Street advisers have said 
48kc040g In its offer Batus signaled that the approval process may take months 
48kc040h In recent months the quota program itself has become increasingly controversial 
48kc040i Some big U\. S\. steelmakers which sell semifinished steel in the domestic marketplace are fighting to continue quotas after their scheduled expiration September thirtieth 
48kc040j Others though dependent on outside supplies of semifinished are pushing to end quotas [door_slam] 
48kc040k If the extradition effort fails the British government loses more than the chance to prosecute a key suspect 
48kc040l It also could lose access to an important source of evidence against other accused individuals [<door_slam]

48kc040v Frankfurt share prices retreated across the board in moderately active trading as the day earlier decline on Wall Street and weaker dollar prompted widespread profit taking

48kc040y After yesterday\'s vote Mr\. Mulroney wouldn\'t say whether he would take any action against the other eight Tories who voted against [<door_slam] the bill 
48kc040z Sounding philosophical he said It\'s a fact of life 
48kc0410 You try and get [door_slam>] unanimity but you don\'t always succeed 
48kc0411 State pre emption was protested by Leslie Gainer a lobbyist for the U\. S\. Public Interest Group which represents consumers 
48kc0412 It\'s a real slap in the face of state legislators she said 
48kc0413 She also complained that full disclosure isn\'t immediately required in credit card solicitations on the telephone or in magazines catalogs and flyers 
48kc0414 Yet she praised the bill for enhancing the disclosure made in most states 
48kc0415 Standard and Poor\'s Corporation put this personnel services concern\'s seventy four \.POINT eight million dollars of B\. plus rated convertible subordinated debt on CreditWatch with negative implications 
48kc0416 The move follows the disclosure last week that investment banker Gibbons Green van Amerongen Limited plans a two step acquisition of a substantial stake in Robert Half 
48kc0417 A Robert Half official said the company is convinced that our debt coverage will be strong and we don\'t think the risks will be unreasonable 
48kc0418 Mr\. Greenspan complied 
48kc0419 What happened there is very similar to what I gather is happening here he said 
48kc041a Just when the Social Security panel was about to give up the dam broke which led us to a rather surprising end 
48kc041b An Upjohn spokeswoman said the company planned to market Rogaine to women all along 
48kc041c However F\. D\. A\. approval for using the drug on men came first because Upjohn didn\'t test the product on enough women initially 
48kc041d Upjohn said it began testing Rogaine on women in nineteen eighty seven about four years after tests on balding men began 
48lc0201 Britain is launching a nationwide AIDS warning campaign that urges the use of condoms for people who won\'t restrict their sexual partners 
48lc0202 Leaflets that are being delivered to twenty three million households warn that AIDS isn\'t limited to homosexuals 
48lc0203 Officials say television warnings will follow 
48lc0204 Even when complaints are filed they can be difficult to verify 
48lc0205 Agencies generally don\'t use undercover testers posing as prospective tenants as they do in race discrimination complaints they fear that the tester could be attacked 
48lc0206 Instead they try to build cases on the testimony of current and former tenants 
48lc0207 Had that happened the failed banks would have been turned over to the F\. D\. I\. C\. for disposition 
48lc0208 In most cases the agency sells the failed bank to another institution along with the good loans 
48lc0209 The F\. D\. I\. C\. purchases the bad loans and tries to salvage whatever it can 
48lc020a For investors the partnerships are only as attractive as the underlying buyouts 
48lc020b Many in the field contend that the buyouts being put together these days are generally overpriced because of several factors 
48lc020c Among them too much capital chasing too few good candidates which has pushed costs up and returns down to what they see as unacceptable levels 
48lc020d The review committee tries to offer a menu of small medium and large capitalization stocks 
48lc020e Some of its most successful picks were quite small companies when first recommended 
48lc020f Money managers minding billion dollar portfolios on the other hand often avoid sm:aller stocks because they can\'t purchase a significant stake without affecting the price 
48lc020g The dollar\'s slippage came despite more comments from Treasury Secretary James Baker aimed at supporting it 
48lc020h In a television interview Mr\. Baker said the U\. S\. and its top six economic allies are prepared to act to stabilize the dollar around the current levels 
48lc020i Last week the Treasury secretary warned in a speech that a continued decline in the U\. S\. currency\'s value could be counterproductive 
48lc020j Those creditors include multilateral agencies Latin American and some European governments and short term commercial bank creditors [<misc_noise] and suppliers

48lc0210 A senior NATO diplomat accused the Soviets of trying to seduce the Germans away from us 
48lc0211 It is none too subtle wedge driving he told Reuters 
48lc0212 But at another operation in rural north Illinois there are hardly any minorities to draw from

48lc021e The jury also found that Clayton under Missouri common law had breached its fiduciary duties because of self dealing 
48lc021f The appeals court upheld the lower court in October nineteen eighty eight 
48lc0301 The statute allows for a great deal of latitude agrees Arthur Christy the first special prosecutor appointed under the nineteen seventy eight law 
48lc0302 In past investigations he notes the focus has been quite narrow 
48lc0303 But in each case he suggests It\'s up to the counsel he certainly has the powers 
48lc0304 Also the strong rise in share prices in recent weeks appears to have discounted most of the good news likely in the budget another dealer said 
48lc0305 It\'s going to take quite a lot to move it sharply ahead from this level he said 
48lc0306 The hundred share index is up eighteen \.POINT six \%PERCENT this year 
48lc0307 Some tire executives such as John J\. Nevin chief executive officer of Firestone Tire and Rubber Company say Mr\. Stone understands the industry\'s problems 
48lc0308 But Mr\. Stone\'s union critics aren\'t so generous 
48lc0309 They say he has been lax about organizing new members for example 
48lc030a Under the agreement subject to regulatory approval Ypsilanti shareholders would receive one \.POINT nine three five shares of Trustcorp common for each common share of Ypsilanti 
48lc030b Trustcorp said it plans to complete the purchase in the fourth quarter 
48lc030c Ypsilanti Savings Bank has about a hundred and thirty eight million in assets 
48lc030d Trustcorp Inc\. is a holding company with assets of four \.POINT six billion 
48lc030e Critics of indexing charge that the approach lacks imagination and amounts to settling for mediocrity 
48lc030f [tongue_click] Advocates reply that indexing means lower management fees than those of actively managed bond funds 
48lc030g Also indexing in recent years often has produced significantly better results than many active managers 
48lc030h But John Smale P\. and G\'s chairman and chief executive used the meeting to speak at length about hostile takeovers in general 
48lc030i He maintained that too often they leave companies loaded with debt and shrunken research budgets and ignore the interests of employees and the communities in which the companies do business 
48lc030j [tongue_click] He also argued that over the long run hostile takeovers don\'t necessarily provide a good mechanism for shareholders to realize full value for their shares 
48lc030k A French press report said the exports include sophisticated equipment for making semiconductors 
48lc030l It said the machinery may have helped the Soviets build advanced computer memories for such military purposes as missile guidance 
48lc030m [tongue_click] Western nations have reached agreements intended to forbid exports of such equipment to the Soviets 
48lc030n [tongue_click] When stocks are rising portfolio insurers don\'t hedge and instead ride the market higher

48lc030x [tongue_click] If they\'ve got something to show us we\'ll take a look at it 
48lc030y They know where to find us said one source 
48lc030z We\'re not stonewalling them 
48lc0310 Car sales apparently have leveled off after disappointing results early in the year followed by a sharp uptick in late January 
48lc0311 Bigger incentives fueled the rebound and have helped sustain the sales pace 
48lc0312 Chrysler Corp\. for example boosted cash rebates to twenty five hundred dollars on some models 
48lc0313 Given the nature of our ownership it\'s obviously a very complex issue Mr\. Elish said 
48lc0314 There are a lot of things to consider and we\'re looking at it 
48lc0315 [lip_smack] But nothing is imminent 
48lc0316 It does not however seem reasonable to the Germans who are instead mulling a tax increase to shore up a leaky government budget 
48lc0317 As for the U\. S\. comments on German inflation a typical German might respond Zero inflation 
48lc0318 What\'s wrong with that 
48lc0319 Generally there\'s no limit on how much of their funds employees can borrow if their accounts total ten thousand or less 
48lc031a For larger accounts employees are restricted to borrowing half the total but no more than fifty thousand 
48lc031b [tongue_click] Loans must be repaid within five years unless the money goes toward buying a principal residence in which case longer repayment terms can be arranged 
48lc031c Borrowed funds aren\'t taxed 
48lc031d But a withdrawal is treated as taxable income and is subject to an additional ten \%PERCENT penalty tax 
48lc0401 Like Drexel Mr\. Icahn has been subpoenaed in connection with the government\'s continuing investigation of the Boesky scandal 
48lc0402 [lip_smack] A subpoena is a request for information and doesn\'t imply any wrongdoing 
48lc0403 Mr\. Icahn\'s lawyers at Weil Gotschal and Manges in New York said the investigation had absolutely no connection with the withdrawal of Mr\. Icahn\'s bid 
48lc0404 But Mr\. Gibbs is hopeful that many taxpayers will accept 
48lc0405 Among other incentives the new tax law phases out the deductibility of interest payments to the I\. R\. S\. 
48lc0406 [tongue_click] The I\. R\. S\. also has been successful in Tax Court challenges to people involved in tax shelters 
48lc0407 We\'re winning more than we\'re losing the I\. R\. S\. chief points out 
48lc0408 Doubleday also provided Bertelsmann with much needed U\. S\. book manufacturing operations 
48lc0409 Moreover Mr\. Vitale says it\'s worth a premium to get a foothold in the U\. S\. market 
48lc040a If you are in publishing the only market with large numbers is the English speaking market he says 
48lc040b Many people however claim that irresponsible owners not the dogs themselves are to blame for the high incidence of attacks 
48lc040c They\'re amoral says an official of the United Kennel Club a prestigious pedigree association 
48lc040d They\'ll do what the trainer allows them to do 
48lc040e K\. mart and Bruno\'s said their hypermarkets which haven\'t been named yet will include specialty shops 
48lc040f The facilities will cover about two hundred and twenty five thousand square feet or three times the space of the average K\. mart discount department store 
48lc040g Located in major metropolitan areas they will be !totally distinct from the current operations of both companies a prepared statement said 
48lc040h The first is expected to open next year 
48lc040i What\'s more a further drop in the dollar could have the very result Mr\. Baker seeks to avoid higher interest rates 
48lc040j In order to keep persuading foreign investors to hold cheaper dollars the Federal Reserve must keep U\. S\. interest rates higher than those abroad 
48lc040k An even weaker dollar could require higher rates 
48lc040l Under terms of the original agreement Computer Memories would have issued new shares of its own exchange for shares of closely held Hemdale 
48lc040m Current Hemdale holders then would have owned about seventy eight \%PERCENT of Computer Memories\' shares 
48lc040n The surviving company would have been named Hemdale Film Corp\. and John Daly Hemdale\'s current chairman would have become chief executive officer of the surviving company 
48lc040o A spokesman for Cray described the M\. I\. T\. decision as good news 
48lc040p [tongue_click] Assuming the bidding does open up again it means there\'s room for technical considerations and not considerations based purely on price 
48lc040q [tongue_click] The spokesman said it would have been impossible for Cray to install and operate a complete supercomputer system at the prices M\. I\. T\. wanted to pay 
48lc040r With technology like this the company that invented the overnight express business fourteen years ago still dominates it 
48lc040s [tongue_click] Federal Express collects more than half the revenue in what is now more than a six billion dollar industry 
48lc040t [tongue_click] And at a time when deteriorating service is a national malady this company claims [door_slam>] to deliver more than ninety nine \%PERCENT of its letters and packages on time 
48lc040u Housing starts totaled one million six hundred seventy four thousand three hundred units last year up twenty two \.POINT seven \%PERCENT from nineteen eighty six 
48lc040v In December alone starts rose twenty \.POINT eight \%PERCENT to one hundred fifty five thousand five hundred eighty nine units 
48lc040w That marked the twentieth consecutive monthly increase 
48lc040x Early February North American built car sales edged up zero \.POINT three \%PERCENT according to figures reported last week 
48lc040y That translates into a seasonally adjusted annual rate of eight \.POINT one million vehicles compared with a seven \.POINT seven million rate a year earlier 
48lc040z This week\'s mid February report on car sales will tell whether that pace was being maintained 
48lc0410 Of course to a great extent the stock prices of the various companies that will be reporting higher earnings already reflect shareholder expectations 
48lc0411 That obviously will mute the price movement of any particular stock when the company reports its earnings unless analysts\' estimates are seriously out of kilter 
48lc0412 [tongue_click] As portfolio strategists puzzle over the market impact of this wave of good news they come up with some sharply divergent opinions 
48lc0413 After Larry Speakes lost his job with Merrill Lynch I was a little reluctant to join the posse of critics 
48lc0414 You hate to kick a guy when he\'s down

48lc041a Overall consumer spending has slowed since last year\'s stock market crash but it\'s still at a level that worries some economists 
48lc041b Consumer credit slowed sharply in July reflecting sluggish sales

48mc0204 The system isn\'t hundred \%PERCENT perfect but it\'s working reasonably well a Foreign Ministry official [<door_slam] told reporters 
48mc0205 The official said the U\. S\. has been similarly reassured 
48mc0206 Even so the U\. S\. has indicated that it wants Japan to take better care of how Japanese technology is sold around the world

48mc020h One of the best known international stock pickers John Templeton nearly equaled the index without any Japanese stocks in his small Templeton Foreign fund 
48mc020i He did so via winning bets in such markets as Mexico Canada and Britain 
48mc020j We were very fortunate he said 
48mc020k His larger funds which can include U\. S\. stocks didn\'t fare as well 
48mc020l Turnout is another unknown factor 
48mc020m To capitalize here Governor Dukakis would like to see a heavy turnout especially in such pockets of strength as the Chicago lakefront and suburbs 
48mc020n But that may not happen Illinois registration is below nineteen eighty four and no presidential candidate has yet caught fire [door_slam]

48mc020t Regulators he says can\'t be too hard on people who justifiably claim they haven\'t had time to comply 
48mc020u [door_slam] Anyone who accepts the job of investigating the Speaker should be prepared to take some heat 
48mc020v Last week Common Cause called for an investigation of Mr\. Wright\'s finances 
48mc020w The Speaker retaliated in a public statement and his minions in the leadership said the group was dead on Capitol Hill 
48mc020x The whole environment has changed he says 
48mc020y We have a lot more options than we did before 
48mc020z He\'s planning on spending seven million dollars on advertising and promotion this year compared with a couple of million dollars in the past 
48mc0210 Condom sales for the entire industry were up twenty seven \%PERCENT for the twelve months ended in April 
48mc0211 Carter Wallace\'s share amounts to over fifty \%PERCENT of the total market 
48mc0212 Mr\. Chatichai\'s wealthy family background and his family\'s large property interests give him a good understanding of the business community 
48mc0213 Further he has good relations with the large ethnic Chinese community and serves as chairman of the *Thai* Chinese Friendship Association 
48mc0214 That\'s important for the country\'s business elite many of whom are ethnic Chinese 
48mc0215 As a result the Sequoia won\'t be going back to the U\. S\. Navy this year 
48mc0216 Or perhaps any year 
48mc0217 And the ship which was used by eight U\. S\. presidents might even go under 
48mc0218 The Treasury is scheduled to announce details of its quarterly financing operation November second 
48mc0219 [tongue_click] It usually consists of three year notes ten year notes and thirty year bonds 
48mc021a But the department is very close to reaching its limits on issuing long term debt and thus has asked Congress to increase its authority 
48mc021b Congress still hasn\'t completed work on the issue which is part of the tax bill passed late Tuesday by the Senate 
48mc021c In recent months Spicer has cut its one thousand member U\. S\. staff by ten \%PERCENT in an effort to cut costs 
48mc021d Mr\. Bernstein said that a merger of the two firms world wide would create an international organization with one billion dollars in annual revenue 
48mc021e We believe Spicer is a very good niche firm but our merger discussions are very early at this point he said 
48mc0301 [tongue_click] In addition to the war of nerves over discounts retail executives said this Christmas season has been characterized by the absence of a big hit in the toy department 
48mc0302 But retailers have seen strong sales of big ticket items to well heeled customers 
48mc0303 They are buying to beat the new tax law which will end the deduction of sales taxes and some interest expenses 
48mc0304 It\'s about as interesting as yesterday\'s tuna fish said Maryann Keller an auto analyst with Furman Selz Mager Dietz and Birney 
48mc0305 The Japanese are going to have a heck of a time selling two \.POINT three million cars in nineteen eighty seven 
48mc0306 I\'m not sure holding quotas does them any harm 
48mc0307 Ms\. Bass won\'t discuss strategy for I\. Magnin 
48mc0308 But industry observers say I\. Magnin like other retailers in today\'s saturated markets will have to establish a more focused identity 
48mc0309 Ms\. Bass also will have to reassess the value of some of its scattered stores including those in Chicago Washington and Arizona and increase sales volume 
48mc030a That\'s the only cure says Mark Shulman president of Limited Incorporated\'s Henri Bendel and a former executive at I\. Magnin and Bloomingdale\'s 
48mc030b While all West German political parties agreed on the need for tax cuts of about twenty two billion dollars they differ on who should benefit 
48mc030c The Social Democrats and the left wing Greens want the cuts to help the poor and the working class 
48mc030d Within the ruling coalition the liberal Free Democrats and the Bavarian sister party of the Christian Democrats the Christian Socialists want cuts spread across the board 
48mc030e His answer Raise the temperature artificially in the morning by jogging or with a hot drink 
48mc030f Breakfast also helps as does jumping into a hot shower on awakening 
48mc030g At the opposite end Morning people take naps

48mc030i Mr\. Walsh\'s legal theory about the flow of funds is likely to be the linchpin of an effort to bring broader conspiracy and other criminal charges 
48mc030j Central targets of the investigation include former National Security Adviser John Poindexter former White House aide Oliver North and retired Air Force Major General Richard Secord 
48mc030k A final decision on seeking charges could come in September 
48mc030l In the two selected areas the state will allow procurement and retail prices to rise to what the open market demands 
48mc030m The subsidy for consumers is meant to reduce the strain on urban residents 
48mc030n Farmers of course will get higher prices for their grain from the market which in turn should induce them to increase production 
48mc030o Grain production throughout China has faltered in recent years in part because state procurement prices were too low 
48mc030p Remember the one about the investment banker

48mc030v These are very interesting times said Richard Shaffer an industry consultant and analyst who publishes Technologic Computer Letter 
48mc030w A year ago it seemed that I\. B\. M\. and Microsoft alone would dictate the standards for desktop computers in the office 
48mc030x Now after Apple\'s lawsuit challenging Microsoft and Sun coming up with Open Look for Unix we have the possibility of seeing three very competitive standards 
48mc030y The government\'s official armed forces magazines traditionally have been off limits to all advertisers 
48mc030z But recently the Army and Navy started considering farming theirs out to commercial publishers who would accept ads 
48mc0310 [tongue_click] We\'re exploring it to see how much money we could save on our Soldiers magazine an Army spokesman says 
48mc0311 All of this reflects a move of transition and uncertainty that has gripped Britain\'s publicly subsidized theater in recent years 
48mc0312 Fretting about finances most companies are taking fewer creative risks 
48mc0313 Audiences in turn have grown more conservative

48mc0318 The suggested retail price for Cinderella is twenty six dollars and ninety nine cents and for E\. T\. twenty four dollars and ninety five cents 
48mc0319 [tongue_click] But both have been heavily discounted by as much as nine dollars a cassette and both have rebate offers 
48mc031a The home video industry is hoping the massive purchases of both cassettes will turn many cassette renters into at least occasional buyers in the future 
48mc031b There are still legislative issues to be resolved on the Senate floor and among four House committees before the bill reaches the House floor 
48mc031c Business groups for example are unhappy at provisions requiring bus companies to install wheelchair lifts and handicapped toilets in new over the road buses 
48mc031d The groups also criticize the lack of a blanket small business exemption for public accommodations 
48mc031e But many other business objections have already been dealt with in the White House Senate negotiations pretty much eliminating the chances that the measure could yet be derailed

48mc0404 Robert E\. Wunderle vice president of public affairs for [door_slam>] Supermarkets General said the company has held discussions in good faith with the Hafts 
48mc0405 He added that the company is disappointed that the Hafts have chosen to publicize the contents of a letter filled with half truths and distortions 
48mc0406 He declined to elaborate 
48mc0407 [tongue_click] Mr\. Junger previously has denied any wrongdoing and has said he isn\'t responsible for the currency loss 
48mc0408 He was summarily dismissed by the company when the currency loss came to light ending his severance contract that was to run until September 
48mc0409 He resigned from V\. W\. in January over differences on how the auto maker\'s foreign exchange department should be run 
48mc040a The world is made up of optimists and pessimists says Mr\. Stone

48mc040d Quebec Energy Minister John Ciaccia said the provincially owned utility plans to appeal the ruling to the Federal Court of Canada 
48mc040e New England utility and energy officials said the decision isn\'t a cause for serious concern yet because of the appeal 
48mc040f They added that there\'s still time for New England utilities to seek alternative energy sources 
48mc040g The window of opportunity for the creation of superregional banks might not be open long 
48mc040h Then we will face the challenge of consolidating our positions 
48mc040i It\'s going to be tough 
48mc040j What has distinguished us is that our returns on assets and equity are far above average

48mc040p Full year sales rose fourteen \%PERCENT to seventy one \.POINT six billion dollars from sixty two \.POINT seven billion dollars 
48mc040q That large jump enabled Ford to increase its share of the U\. S\. new car market to twenty \.POINT two \%PERCENT from eighteen \.POINT two \%PERCENT 
48mc040r After his orientation Mr\. Boesky will be assigned a regular job 
48mc040s Though he can state a preference Mr\. Sams said Mr\. Boesky will go where the prison needs him 
48mc040t He noted that many of the most desirable jobs are snapped up by inmates with more seniority 
48mc040u [tongue_click] The desirable jobs Mr\. Sams said are at the prison\'s factory which makes wooden furniture for federal offices the dairy farm and the slaughterhouse 
48mc040v Meanwhile Audi set up a bonus plan to encourage dealership salespeople to sell Audi eighty and ninety cars newer models that carry far less generous incentives 
48mc040w Under the bonus plan Audi promised to give sales people two hundred fifty dollars every time they sold an eighty or ninety model

48mc0411 Mr\. Leppo was chief merchandising officer and executive vice president at Allied from August nineteen eighty seven until last July 
48mc0412 He and Ms\. Fortune said Mr\. Campeau encouraged them to bid for Ann Taylor 
48mc0413 Ms\. Fortune has been president and chief executive officer of Ann Taylor for the past one and a half years 
48mc0414 But the lawmakers actually spent only about five hundred million dollars of the money authorized under the legislation this fiscal year 
48mc0415 And so far hardly any of the promised additional two \.POINT three billion dollars has been forthcoming 
48mc0416 We lost our bill concedes Senator Moynihan a New York Democrat 
48mc0417 The inescapable fact however is that one day the water is going to run out or become too expensive to pump up 
48mc0418 We\'re going to see less production 
48mc0419 There\'s no way around it says Kansas State extension [phone_ring/] economist Mark Nelson [/phone_ring]

48mc041e The Treasury market got off to a weak start overnight in Tokyo where limited selling among Japanese investors pushed prices as much as a quarter point lower 
48mc041f When the market opened in the U\. S\. prices remained lower throughout the day

48nc0201 States are getting serious about welfare reform because they can no longer afford to subsidize [loud_breath] a percentage of their residents in perpetuity 
48nc0202 A growing body of evidence suggests that increased welfare spending will not make a dent in poverty 
48nc0203 To the contrary the spending may actually have consequences such as family dissolution illegitimate births and chr:onic unemployment 
48nc0204 More enlightened welfare policy must abate not exacerbate these problems 
48nc0205 A miscalculation prompted California to move first 
48nc0206 [tongue_click] [loud_breath] Legislators worried that Proposition thirteen tax restraints would force big layoffs of government workers hurriedly passed a short time compensation law in July nineteen seventy eight 
48nc0207 Those layoffs never came budget surpluses permitted state and local governments to retain staffs

48nc0211 [loud_breath] On a per ton basis pretax profit doubled to about thirty six dollars from eighteen dollars in the third quarter 
48nc0212 However the performance fell short of U\. S\. X\. Chairman David Roderick\'s prediction of a fifty dollars plus per ton profit

48nc030p Import data are directly collected by a single government agency they provide revenue from tariffs and they provide politically important measures of goods subject to quotas

48oc031c [loud_breath] He said Apparently Anchor is concerned that the information it is offering to provide [loud_breath] will give Vitro a basis for lowering the price

48oc040n [tongue_click] If Ronald Reagan wants Robert Bork confirmed he will have to create an alternative choice to the one these groups are trying to force on undecided senators 
48oc040o That means Mr\. Reagan has to explain clearly why American society will benefit if judges such as Robert Bork [loud_breath] apply the law in a neutral manner 
48oc040p [tongue_click] He will have to point out why many of the long held grievances of the electorate result when unelected judges manufacture [<misc_noise] new laws 
48oc040q Mr\. Antoniu\'s fall and surprising rebound proves there is life after insider trading 
48oc040r But his story [<misc_noise] also *suggests* that some character traits that may give rise to insider trading can be hard to change 
48oc040s Insider trading is a form of fraud and some Sport About franchisees now claim they have been defrauded by Mr\. Antoniu 
48oc040t Pet owners often call a pet psychic because a pet is sick [<misc_noise] and they want a detailed account of how it\'s feeling 
48oc040u And some pet psychics claim they can chat with a pet from a distance 
48oc040v For example Gay Travers a former publicist called pet psychic Penelope Smith when her cat Sebastian was very ill

48oc040z [loud_breath] It\'s a fashionable number said Mr\. Chandross of Lloyd\'s Bank New York 
48oc0410 [loud_breath] Economists are currently focusing on the index to get a reading on wage inflation 
48oc0411 The Labor Department will continue to report monthly aggregate data on average hourly earnings 
48oc0412 ~ -(B)ut the index is being replaced by the employment cost series 
48oc0413 Economists said that the new index has the advantage of being more reliable reading [loud_breath] and the disadvantage of coming out only [loud_breath] a quarter rather than every month [loud_breath] 
48oc0414 [tongue_click] Newspapers\' costs up a(re)- sharply this year largely because the higher newsprint prices [loud_breath] the industry\'s biggest cost behind labor expenses 
48oc0415 Since October nineteen eighty six prices have risen three times by the total of about twenty one \%PERCENT 
48oc0416 [loud_breath] Newspapers have responded by using lighter weight paper trimming page size and cutting the space for news 
48oc0417 Meanwhile civil RICO continues to attract plaintiffs [loud_breath] who want to turn general business disputes that belong in the state courts into federal offenses

48oc0419 The second lowest bidder recently filed a civil RICO action claiming that misrepresentations were made by the successful bidders using the telephone thereby committing federal wire fraud

48sc020s And sanctions in the short run won\'t damage South Africa\'s self reliant economy

48sc0215 This was rough on all debtors domestic as well as international 
48sc0216 But no one proposed solutions for domestic debtors as grand as those officially offered for Third World debtors

48sc021c Within recent memory we have seen the junk equities of the sixties the heated Third World lending of the seventies and the thrift crisis of the eighties

48sc030a Defenders of the footnote argue that it makes sense as tax policy 
48sc030b Why they ask should wealthy best selling authors get substantial tax deferrals while mom and pop manufacturers for example can\'t

48sc030h The confrontation in federal court may break new ground in bankruptcy law 
48sc030i Other courts notably the one in charge of the Manville Corp\. Chapter eleven proceedings have set up trust funds to pay large classes of injury victims

48sc0407 Like their economies the currencies of the U\. S\. and Canada are closely related 
48sc0408 But as interest rates rise in Canada the Canadian dollar is gaining on its U\. S\. counterpart traders and analysts say

48tc0210 Switzerland has already attracted one million resident aliens a portion of its population greater than any E\. C\. state except Luxembourg 
48tc0211 Most Swiss think that that is enough and the country has imposed foreign worker quotas so strict that the skilled labor is in short supply

48tc0301 The new government has started to lower personal income taxes and at the same time it has begun to bring its own spending under control 
48tc0302 In the nineteen eighty seven budget the highest rate of income tax was lowered to fifty eight \%PERCENT from sixty five \%PERCENT 
48tc0303 This is part of a world wide movement that France must follow to keep its most energetic aggressive and bright young people and to attract investors 
48tc0304 The new tax law\'s limits on retirement benefits for executives spur greater interest in certain trusts that help safeguard deferred compensation until retirement time 
48tc0305 Such trusts aren\'t completely inviolate creditors can claim the money after a bankruptcy for example

48uc0305 [tongue_click] Smokers are feeling the heat because companies are taking a harder line on such issues as productivity rising medical costs and the effects of passive smoke 
48uc0306 Although there are conflicting claims about whether smokers cost employers more in terms of higher insurance rates and absenteeism companies often cite such concerns to justify restrictive smoking policies

48uc0313 Last December the U\. N\. didn\'t attempt to solicit bids 
48uc0314 It simply extended its contract with National Carting 
48uc0315 Soliciting bids in this particular industry is not the way to go a U\. N\. spokesman says implying that it is futile 
48uc0316 But critics charged that the collar actually added to the volatility by making it more difficult for index arbitragers to do their business 
48uc0317 Many traders argue that such arbitrage has the effect of smoothing out volatility in the markets 
48uc0318 Index arbitragers buy and sell large amounts of stocks and stock index futures to take advantage of brief price disparities between the two related instruments 
48uc0319 The scene the Annual Norman Mailer Cocktail Party and Fist Fight 
48uc031a Candice Bergen and Woody Allen had just joined a group of pseudo intellectuals and were rambling with the best of them 
48uc031b I often think observed Ms\. Bergen that if Dostoevski had been a singer he\'d have sounded like Ray Charles 
48uc031c The other non winners most notably Exxon were in many ways as noteworthy as the winners 
48uc031d It is believed that Exxon was outbid for several reserve packages leaving it with a lot of cash that could still be earmarked for acquisitions 
48uc031e At the Houston Petroleum Club industry officials couldn\'t eat lunch of late without discussing speculation that Exxon was going to walk away with all of the Tenneco properties 
48uc031f An Exxon spokeswoman said it was company policy not to comment on anything to do with acquisitions 
48uc0401 Also selling well was a fifty million dollar issue of revenue bonds by the Florida Department of Natural Resources 
48uc0402 The unsold balance was about ten \.POINT three million dollars 
48uc0403 [tongue_click] The bonds were priced after auction to yield from four \.POINT two zero \%PERCENT in nineteen eighty eight to seven \.POINT two zero \%PERCENT in two thousand twelve

48uc0406 Still he would have preferred there to be no bids at all 
48uc0407 The company\'s policy for eighty five years has been to be independent and grow and we have succeeded he says 
48uc0408 We are evaluating the offers for the company and for the shareholders but we profoundly regret the situation 
48uc0409 So strange is the situation that one Holly director has proposed changing the company\'s name to Fantasy s- Sugar Company 
48uc040a He says he could entice Shamrock because of its Disney connection to buy the company 
48uc040b Just think of how much they could make on the movie rights he adds 
48uc040c During the past several days corporations and other big investors have refrained from lending Treasury bonds and notes to securities dealers [<door_slam] for brief periods 
48uc040d That in turn has forced many dealers to refrain from selling borrowed securities or amassing so called short positions 
48uc040e It\'s hard to short anything in this market at the moment said a trader at a large government securities dealer 
48uc040f Mr\. Antoniu denies any wrongdoing 
48uc040g I don\'t have anything to worry about the former investment banker says 
48uc040h I have always followed the advice of my lawyer and accountants 
48uc040i He says that he has cooperated in an inquiry by Florida officials but that he isn\'t aware the matter has been referred to the attorney general\'s office 
48uc040j In any case he says Sport About\'s problems will be cured by the public offering and are commonplace in any rapidly growing franchise business [door_slam] 
48uc040k Where can we find some clues to the answer or at least a possible answer to this question 
48uc040l [tongue_click] I would suggest that we look at the one Marxist *Leninist* state that already has gone quite far down the revisionist road 
48uc040m I refer to the curiously neglected instance of Yugoslavia 
48uc040n Outside of the congressional leadership patience is wearing thin on pork barreling continuing resolutions 
48uc040o There are even congressmen who say that they want to pass separate budget bills this year 
48uc040p We\'ll see 
48uc040q What seems more likely is that either a President or the courts or both someday will have to rescue the veto by forcing Congress to give up its arrogant ways 
48uc040r So far we\'ve found that federal employees have dealt with this issue with a great deal of sensitivity and common sense Mrs\. Horner said 
48uc040s But there is a need for clarity 
48uc040t These guidelines will serve as *reassurance* to our managers 
48uc040u Senator Bentsen\'s corporate tax proposal would replace a provision in the committee bill allowing the Internal Revenue Service to withhold refunds from taxpayers who have defaulted on government loans 
48uc040v This provision wouldn\'t raise any money in the current fiscal year and Senator Bentsen wanted something that would allow a quicker end to the diesel tax collection

48uc0412 The company is headed by Drew Lewis frequently a troubleshooter for the Republicans 
48uc0413 The National Association of Realtors is throwing several parties and proudly boasts that eighty nine of its members are delegates or *alternates* to this convention 
48uc0414 Discussion of this subject better described as brooding about it i- is filled with misconceptions 
48uc0415 One of these is the great concern with the U\. S\. having become a net debtor 
48uc0416 What is meant by this is that Americans apparently own fewer assets abroad than foreigners own in the U\. S\. 
48uc0417 Many people have pointed out that these calculations are spurious because the assets are not all valued on the same basis 
48uc0418 If all assets were valued at today\'s prices the net debt of the U\. S\. would certainly be smaller than it now appears and might be a net asset 
48uc0419 Investors taking part in the financing will lend Venezuela one billion dollars in exchange for monthly payments from the New York trust fund 
48uc041a Those payments will be set when the financing is completed which is expected in mid December 
48uc041b The interest rate will be based on the five year U\. S\. Treasury bond rate plus a still undecided interest rate margin the Venezuelan official said [misc_noise] 
48uc041c Investors continue to flock to the more conservative stock portfolios

48vc020a Other toy makers such as Mattel Incorporated have been bringing out new products earlier in the year to increase sales at times other than Christmas 
48vc020b But Tyco\'s day after Christmas launch is unusual 
48vc020c The toy business is ripe for some marketing innovation after two years of [door_slam>] relatively flat sales says Rick Anguilla editor of Toy and Hobby World magazine 
48vc020d If Tyco succeeds others will certainly follow 
48vc020e [door_slam] No one seems quite sure how the publisher juggles his assets among his various companies which include the publicly owned Maxwell Communication Corporation and various private ones 
48vc020f Control of the public company and of private interests like Mirror Group Newspapers Limited rests with a foundation in Liechtenstein Pergamon Holding Foundation about which little is disclosed 
48vc020g He says its beneficiaries are charities which he promises to identify someday soon 
48vc020h The Bank of Italy also reportedly sold marks to buy Italian lire 
48vc020i The transactions may have been directed mainly at defending the sagging lira in the European Monetary System in which eight European currencies float within specified limits 
48vc020j But they also had effect of helping the dollar by increasing the supply of marks in the market 
48vc020k For Environmental Treatment which like Mr\. Kirk relishes an extremely low profile the oil spill has brought a wave of attention 
48vc020l In fact when Wall Street learned that the publicly held company was hired to handle the multimillion dollar cleanup [loud_breath] the concern\'s stock shot up almost ten \%PERCENT

48vc020q The impact will be enormous 
48vc020r The Republicans\' strongest case against the Democratic nominee his naivete on national security issues will disappear 
48vc020s The suspicion of a selection based entirely on political instead of *substantive* grounds will be undercut

48vc020u Mr\. Tucker\'s hard hitting campaign has in turn appalled top union leaders who say he has tarnished their reputation as one of the labor movement\'s cleanest organizations 
48vc020v Statements of an undemocratic union being in bed with management . hurt this union said Mr\. Bieber

48vc020y Another twenty five \%PERCENT is held under the company\'s employee stock ownership plan 
48vc020z [tongue_click] Most of the people in the former category are expected to extend the no sell agreement for another year he said 
48vc0210 O\. T\. C\. brokers also stress that their stocks often outperform listed ones on a long term basis 
48vc0211 And overall the Nasdaq Composite Index is up thirteen \%PERCENT this year twice as much as the Dow Jones Industrial Average 
48vc0212 Also they note the tiny stocks that generally trade under three dollars a share have always taken a big percentage moves up or down when they move at all 
48vc0213 These mixed feelings of frustration with and gratitude toward authorities are part of the everyday life of a foreigner doing business in Korea 
48vc0214 In fact such contradictions are what seem to make the Korean world go round 
48vc0215 A Western businessman needs to be ready for them 
48vc0216 Here are a few hard learned facts of Korean business life 
48vc0217 There are also broker finders that get fees merely for matching borrowers and lenders of stock 
48vc0218 Broker finders can also include the brokerage firms themselves 
48vc0219 The government is investigating whether all the payments that fly to and from such broker finders are legitimate 
48vc021a We are extremely selective said Paul Suckow director of fixed income at Oppenheimer Management Corporation 
48vc021b I don\'t think some issues are going to make it he said

48vc030d People took positions in the stock simply on the rumor of a takeover by someone no one had ever heard of 
48vc030e Some of the full time risk takers don\'t even need public announcements to plunge 
48vc030f Nor do they require inside information a la Ivan *Boesky* who was venal but not insane 
48vc030g The people who invested in Dayton Hudson however were mad

48vc030q A new date hasn\'t been set 
48vc030r [tongue_click] A Unisys spokesman said the companies hope to complete the *acquisition* which requires *Timeplex* holders\' approval and government clearance in about four months 
48vc030s At the meeting shareholders approved an increase in authorized common shares to twenty million from fifteen million 
48vc030t The additional shares may be used for benefit plans to obtain additional financing or to make acquisitions

48vc030v The United States of course has a vast and in many places efficient infrastructure 
48vc030w The council study put a value of one trillion dollars on the parts it measured 
48vc030x [tongue_click] But government owned fixed capital suffers along with privately owned plant and equipment when economic policies discourage long term investment 
48vc030y The greatest scourge of investment is of course inflation which explains why the national infrastructure suffered particularly during the nineteen seventies 
48vc030z User fees simply could not keep up with the soaring costs of loans and construction 
48vc0310 Highway construction had the added problem of reduced yields from gasoline taxes brought about by energy shortages and shortage enforced conservation 
48vc0311 The measure was a bold move for a president who has to come to view inertia as the best form of security 
48vc0312 The suspension effectively will slash salaries and cut an estimated eight \.POINT three billion dollars from federal spending this year 
48vc0313 The aim is to hold the budget deficit to four \.POINT nine \%PERCENT of economic output down from a projected seven \%PERCENT 
48vc0314 This it is hoped will help stop high inflation from spiraling into hyperinflation 
48vc0315 The think tank measured expense ratios which are a fund\'s operating costs as a percentage of assets 
48vc0316 For investors high ratios are clearly of concern 
48vc0317 It cuts into potential return even when a fund is doing well 
48vc0318 And it leaves a fund with less of a cushion in case performance sours 
48vc0319 Almost unnoticed in the discussions of the procurement scandal is the fact that this elaborate indeed tortuous system seems to have worked at least on its own terms 
48vc031a Nobody was able to throw a contract directly 
48vc031b Instead what seems contractors seem to have done is to buy inside information that would allow them to prepare a better proposal 
48vc031c Nine month results also include a twelve million dollar net loss from the disposition of trucking operations 
48vc031d About eight million dollars of the trucking charge was taken in the third quarter 
48vc031e Year earlier results were restated for accounting changes 
48vc031f N\. E\. C\. Corporation as one example began donating money to M\. I\. T\. in the nineteen seventies

48vc0405 More than three hundred million dollars worth of weapons were delivered to the Sandinistas in the first half of this year according to the United States intelligence

48vc040c Citicorp\'s loss for the year stemmed from a three billion dollar addition in the second quarter to loss reserves for loans to developing countries 
48vc040d Excluding one time gains and losses Citicorp\'s nineteen eighty seven profit would have been one \.POINT fifteen billion dollars 
48vc040e Excluded are gains on real estate in the fourth quarter and pension assets in the third quarter plus the effect of the reserve addition

48wc0203 And a general strike has been tentatively set for December twelve 
48wc0204 Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value

48wc020b It was a wonderful day for the bond markets said Michael J\. Connery a senior vice president of the financial futures at Chicago based Refco Incorporated 
48wc020c All the apparent signs of inflation were deflated 
48wc020d And that\'s led to a tremendous amount of short covering or traders and investors buying back securities that they borrowed and sold 
48wc020e Still whatever the risk of garbage burning the alternative landfill is worse . says Mr\. McManus the publisher of Resource Recovery Report 
48wc020f Indeed many older landfills weren\'t properly constructed to contain the toxic substances now leaching from decaying trash

48wc0219 It seems that the principles enunciated at the beginning of this decade by Messrs\.

48wc0308 The new tax law\'s limits on retirement benefits for executives spur greater interest in certain trusts that help safeguard deferred compensation until retirement time 
48wc0309 Such trusts aren\'t completely inviolate creditors can claim the money after a bankruptcy for instance 
48wc030a But they are considered better than a mere promise to the executive 
48wc030b The drug azidothymidine or A\. Z\. T\. is the first prescription drug for acquired immune deficiency syndrome to get federal Food and Drug Administration approval 
48wc030c A\. Z\. T\. is marketed under the name Retrovir by Burroughs Wellcome Company at an annual retail dosage cost of about ten thousand dollars 
48wc030d It is also the most expensive prescription drug prompting fears that some insurers who normally provide prescription drug coverage will balk at its price 
48wc030e Now the issue is in the House\'s lap 
48wc030f The temporary ban on new banking powers is a provision in the Senate version of a bill to recapitalize the insolvent Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation 
48wc030g The House F\. S\. L\. I\. C\. measure doesn\'t have any other provisions 
48wc030h In addition by consenting to Rorer\'s bid Robins may have put itself up for sale

48wc030k Californians were asked how the state should get rid of its hefty budget surplus now estimated at one \.POINT one billion 
48wc030l By a two to one margin registered Democrats surveyed by the Field Institute favored giving the money to public schools 
48wc030m But the state constitution may require the money to be returned directly to taxpayers 
48wc030n That appears more in line with Republican thinking

48wc030p Harry Truman whistle stopped the country in nineteen forty eight campaigning against a parochial do nothing Congress that would not enact his legislative program 
48wc030q He struck a chord in the American people not only winning a stunning upset but also defeating scores of Republican congressmen in the process 
48wc030r Truman recognized that presidential contest is not just a race among candidates but also an opportunity to debate great issues such as the proper separation of powers 
48wc030s The contest then isn\'t ideological 
48wc030t It\'s character personality experience 
48wc030u It\'s cultural as much as anything else 
48wc030v President Reagan who was in Durham North Carolina was cautious about the Soviet offer 
48wc030w I\'m waiting to see what the conditions are he said 
48wc030x A senior administration official however called the Gorbachev statement a watershed event because it will increase expectations among Soviet people for withdrawal 
48wc030y Completion of the transaction which also requires approval by the regulatory agencies and holders of other securities must be completed no later than November thirty under the agreement 
48wc030z If it doesn\'t close as expected by September thirty the cash price paid by Nova for each Polysar common share would rise ten Canadian cents 
48wc0310 The cash price would rise fifteen more cents to Canadian fourteen seventy five a share if the transaction closes in November the sides said 
48wc0311 Transamerica said its consumer lending business achieved record results in the quarter with consumer loans secured by real estate growing to two \.POINT five billion 
48wc0312 Its leasing business also posted record results 
48wc0313 Demand for standard containers was high because of strong world trade Transamerica said 
48wc0314 However the San Francisco based company said its real estate operations reported lower earnings 
48wc0315 That leaves the option of a military strike at terrorists or their bases which are mainly in Lebanon\'s Bekaa Valley an area under Syrian control 
48wc0316 U\. S\. intelligence agencies have identified as potential targets there buildings known to have been used by Hezbollah forces and their mentors the Iranian Revolutionary Guards 
48wc0317 But they aren\'t certain which factions use which buildings or when they are present 
48wc0318 Quite possibly a recent profit sharing bonus helped 
48wc0319 We don\'t have an elegant formula says Mr\. Barron 
48wc031a We said we think everyone\'s entitled to a share so here\'s a check 
48wc031b Next year if we do well there may be a bigger check 
48wc031c Is this any way to run a railroad 
48wc031d Could be 
48wc031e Consumers may also be worried about whether auto makers will continue the generous incentive they\'ve used almost continuously over the past year to buoy sales 
48wc031f What\'s happening here is the good old buy in advance syndrome said John Qualls of Micro Economics Limited in Saint Louis 
48wc031g Mr\. Qualls expects sales to sag *badly* in the fourth quarter causing supplies of unsold vehicles to rise unless auto makers show continued restraint in production 
48wc0401 The Iranian crisis and the administration\'s uncertain grip on it has *reawakened* this cynicism 
48wc0402 The polls show much of the public does not believe the president when he denies knowing that profits from Iranian arms sales had been used to aid the Contras 
48wc0403 On this the matter is likely to turn [door_slam] 
48wc0404 Not on whether the shipments were a good idea or on whether lawyers can find some law that has been broken 
48wc0405 But on whether President Reagan told the truth when he denied knowing 
48wc0406 [door_slam] Interco said that because of the definitive agreement its Interco Subsidiary Incorporated unit terminated its tender offer for all Lane common shares at fifty five dollars a share 
48wc0407 The offer was set to expire Monday

48wc040c Pet owners often call a pet psychic because a pet is sick and they want a detailed account of how it\'s feeling 
48wc040d And some pet psychics claim they can chat with pets from a distance 
48wc040e For example Gay Travers a former publicist called pet psychic Penelope Smith when her cat Sebastian was very ill 
48wc040f Ms\. Smith told her to hang up while the psychic talked to Sebastian 
48wc040g Three minutes later she called back with some bad news 
48wc040h [tongue_click] Does that mean a cabinet post 
48wc040i Yeah said Mr\. *Iacocca* 
48wc040j Maybe 
48wc040k More likely though Mr\. *Iacocca* would prefer to be part of an informal group of presidential advisers 
48wc040l Earlier this year the sixty three year old executive signed a new four year contract with Chrysler 
48wc040m And in Tuesday\'s interview Mr\. *Iacocca* maintained that he wants to lead the company into the nineteen nineties 
48wc040n Neither the volunteer doctors nor the scientists conducting the experiment knew which [<door_slam] volunteers were taking active aspirin and which were taking placebos

48wc040p It was this committee that in December decided that the benefits of the aspirin in reducing heart attacks were so clear that there wasn\'t any need to continue the experiment 
48wc040q It\'s a welcome development in the face of very significant inventory overhang says Morgan Stanley\'s Mr\. Roach 
48wc040r A slowing of growth in production gives companies the ability to work off some inventory 
48wc040s And economists note that the steady operating rate indicates continued strength in the manufacturing sector

48wc040z As for principal transactions Wall Street\'s euphemism for trigger happy trading it\'s a bit harder to gauge the risk 
48wc0410 The firm is a big government bond trader and has grown a lot in foreign currency trading 
48wc0411 And among Morgan Stanley\'s biggest percentage gains in nineteen eighty seven was equity principal transactions which nearly tripled to two hundred fifty nine million in revenue 
48wc0412 It\'s pretty reasonable for people to take a dive on this one he says 
48wc0413 I\'m a little scared 
48wc0414 I don\'t blame people for not being heroes

48wc041d Kemper Financial Services\' David Hale refers to a soft takeoff 
48wc041e The latest data fuel Fed worries about reigniting inflation 
48xc0201 [door_slam] The delay is a victory albeit temporary for Mr\. Trump who owns two Atlantic City casino hotels 
48xc0202 Bally\'s agreement to buy the Golden Nugget is widely perceived as an effort to scuttle a takeover attempt by Mr\. Trump 
48xc0203 Mr\. Trump\'s demand that the Golden Nugget purchase be blocked came as a part of a countersuit he filed against Bally in December challenging a Bally financial restructuring plan 
48xc0204 Bally had earlier sued Mr\. Trump alleging various securities law violations 
48xc0205 The outlook in the Senate is still cloudy as long as President Reagan continues to [door_slam>] oppose a tax boost 
48xc0206 Still Senate budget writers are including a significant revenue increase in their deficit reduction package

48xc0208 The Hyundai that nifty and cheap little Korean car has caught on in the U\. S\. and no doubt could compete in any market in the world 
48xc0209 So our William McGurn inquired into how many have been exported [loud_breath] from Korea to Japan 
48xc020a He found that in nineteen eighty six the number was zero 
48xc020b This was down from nineteen eighty five when exports reached one sold to Mitsubishi 
48xc020c [tongue_click] Exports lost to tougher competition abroad and more imports into the U\. S\. market have caused many farmers to abandon their traditional faith in free trade 
48xc020d From sugar long protected to wheat to flowers farmers are demanding that borders be closed 
48xc020e The losers particularly in sugar are many of the Latin American countries whose desperate economies the U\. S\. government is otherwise trying to salvage 
48xc020f Total private construction increased one \.POINT seven \%PERCENT in August after a zero \.POINT four \%PERCENT drop in July 
48xc020g [door_slam] Outlays for public building increased zero \.POINT nine \%PERCENT after a one \.POINT two \%PERCENT rise 
48xc020h Overall August outlays were one \.POINT one \%PERCENT above a year earlier 
48xc020i The huge gap to a large [<door_slam] extent is a price phenomenon 
48xc020j The dollar\'s fall has pushed up the price of imports causing the deficit to swell even as the volume of non oil imports has receded 
48xc020k But long before now these higher prices were supposed to lead to improvement in the monthly merchandise trade deficit as well

48xc020x The piper has to be paid on the other side 
48xc020y Mr\. Perot told Texas officials last month that his new company would bid against E\. D\. S\. to process about eight hundred million a year in Medicaid claims

48xc0214 N\. B\. C\.\'s T\. V\. coverage also gets its share of the blame 
48xc0215 Marketers say it was so bland and skipped so frequently from one event to another that there was little chance for excitement to build 
48xc0216 The constant commercial interruptions which led to ratings that were much lower than expected didn\'t help either 
48xc0217 The rehabilitation process is certainly further along

48xc0302 The trust fund which is financed by ticket and fuel taxes helps pay for F\. A\. A\. operations [loud_breath] and provides grants to airports 
48xc0303 Some have suggested that airport operators as a condition of accepting the grants agree to give up some authority in making noise rules 
48xc0304 Raytheon denied that it is freely giving away jobs 
48xc0305 We aren\'t crazy about offsets but we enter into them as a compromise business arrangement if it\'s the best that\'s available said Raytheon spokesman Lawrence McCracken

48xc030a Floating fails when governments try to escape from the verdict of the exchange markets [loud_breath] on their policies by resorting to direct controls over trade and capital flows 
48xc030b Because this latter threat is now so severe the world is right to talk about international monetary reform if only as a delaying game 
48xc030c But realistic talk should not deceive stabilizing exchange rates requires dependence and subordination not the freedom for everybody to do their own thing 
48xc030d There\'s been a complete turnaround in short term sentiment said Thomas G\. Gibbon a senior vice president at Nomura Securities International Inc\. 
48xc030e For weeks people have been trading bearishly on dollar weakness and a rise in the C\. R\. B\. index

48xc030x His inability to recover from October\'s market plunge was traced to a hostile bid from two rival financiers for Bell Resources Limited which is controlled by Bell Group 
48xc030y The bid forced Mr\. Holmes a Court to call off a proposed merger of the Bell companies 
48xc030z That was the turning point said Darryl Smalley a director at the Perth brokerage Hartley Poynton Limited 
48xc0310 Frankfurt share prices retreated across the board in moderately active trading as the day earlier decline on Wall Street and weaker dollar prompted *widespread* profit taking

48xc0317 Mrs\. Thatcher is not opposed to this 
48xc0318 Britain\'s own markets are more open than those of most European countries London is way ahead of them on capital movement having abolished exchange controls altogether 
48xc0319 The cause of the outrage is that European unity is the device through which the regulators and socialists hope to expand their grip on the Continent 
48xc031a Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value 
48xc031b Thus higher bidding narrows the investor\'s return while lower bidding widens it

490c0201 For investors the partnerships are only as attractive as the underlying buyouts 
490c0202 Many in the field contend that the buyouts being put together these days are generally overpriced because of several factors

490c031b The Fed attributed the increase to stepped up production of commercial and factory equipment as well as aircraft

490c0410 We\'ve always wondered how to square Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega\'s rough words with his soft treatment in the Democratic controlled U\. S\. Congress 
490c0411 Maybe he has too because he\'s upped the ante 
490c0412 He has now branded not only the Republicans but also the Democrats as imperialists because both parties have talked recently about helping the Contras 
490c0413 What do the Democrats become if they actually vote the bandages 
490c0414 The Treasury is scheduled to announce details of its quarterly financing operation November second 
490c0415 It usually consists of three year notes ten year notes and thirty year bonds 
490c0416 But the department is very close to reaching its limit on issuing long term debt and thus has asked Congress to increase its authority

491c020w But bank officials said they are being prudent

491c0213 He points to the fact that Credit Suisse leads in the number of publicly listed bonds launched but lags in the number of [door_slam>] unlisted notes it issued 
491c0214 This is significant he says because bond issues pay higher commissions than unlisted notes 
491c0215 In contrast Senator Bentsen campaigned last week in a half empty plane to a measured cadence

491c0311 And the recorder indicates that a cockpit alarm that should have alerted the crew to improperly set flaps didn\'t go off 
491c0312 When the House and Senate approved the tax bill early Saturday lawmakers didn\'t mention the last minute provisions and congressional staffers described them as technical 
491c0313 While the estimated revenue of almost a hundred million over three years is relatively small the provisions might be perceived as an anti takeover push by Congress 
491c0314 They could have the effect of slowing certain takeover activity congressional sources acknowledged over the weekend 
491c0315 [tongue_click] To be sure the deficit has declined in the past few years 
491c0316 But that decline is entirely the result of a rising surplus in the Social Security trust fund 
491c0317 That money should be invested to help defray the future retirement costs of the baby boomers instead it is being used to paper over the deficit 
491c0318 That\'s yet another symptom of Mr\. Darman\'s national now now ism 
491c0319 This year the Soviets have moved commercial sales to the front burner 
491c031a The export arm of the Soviet Ministry of Aviation Industry hopes to double its revenue by the mid nineteen nineties 
491c031b But such a shift would bring major upheavals to the Soviet system 
491c031c Orders for military aircraft have fallen twenty \%PERCENT in the past two years according to some estimates 
491c031d And for the first time in decades prestigious military design bureaus in the Soviet Union are devoting substantial manpower to civilian projects

491c0401 Last week there were reports that after the offering Shearson Lehman had a big unsold chunk of stock 
491c0402 In a narrowly drawn statement vice chairman Herbert Freiman denied Shearson had offered a block to Salomon Brothers which managed the selling brokers\' floor operation 
491c0403 Mr\. Freiman wouldn\'t elaborate 
491c0404 That may be but there are tough calls 
491c0405 Emotional upset headaches backaches and other subjective symptoms are hard to quantify 
491c0406 Besides someone who truly feels disabled may as a result actually be disabled 
491c0407 A well timed period of time off with stress reduction and an effort at better understanding may prevent a much worse disability later 
491c0408 [tongue_click] It may also uncover factors at the workplace that can be improved 
491c0409 I try to give the patient the benefit of the doubt within reason 
491c040a Not doing so is more than unkind it risks harm to the patient and lawsuits that neither the physician nor employer would welcome 
491c040b But some find electronic investing isn\'t worth the trouble 
491c040c Mr\. Jeffers estimates that a third of investment software buyers eventually junk their purchases because the technology baffles them 
491c040d And while some investors say that computers have made them money others have squandered small fortunes because they relied too heavily on technology 
491c040e Bankers say Chile Mexico and the Philippines have accounted for most of the estimated six billion of debt equity swaps to date 
491c040f Some bankers have estimated that the total may rise as high as ten billion dollars this year

491c040n He said You\'re a free agent Garment 
491c040o Do what you think is appropriate 
491c040p The huge gap to a large extent is a price phenomenon 
491c040q The dollar\'s fall has pushed up the price of imports causing the deficit to swell even as the volume of non oil imports has receded 
491c040r But long before now these higher prices were supposed to lead to improvement in the monthly merchandise trade deficit as well

491c0414 I\'m hoping we get a president who cleans out America 
491c0415 Daniel J\. Gilmartin was named president and chief operating officer of Frank\'s Nursery and Crafts Detroit a unit of this specialty retailer 
491c0416 The posts had been vacant since early nineteen eighty seven 
491c0417 Mr\. Gilmartin had been director of corporate planning for the parent company

492c0201 More traditional academics say many of the newer journals are merely platforms for marginal scholars to write on trivial topics 
492c0202 I\'m dimly aware that they\'re out there says Richard Ullman professor of international affairs at Princeton University and former editor of Foreign Policy magazine 
492c0203 But I can\'t imagine that people who publish something that\'s important wouldn\'t want to publish in the leading journals

492c0207 Analysts also said they hadn\'t expected lower operating profits for the company\'s Industries Group and for the broadcasting segment 
492c0208 Westinghouse officials told analysts that operating profit in the Industries Group fell fifteen \%PERCENT to twenty \%PERCENT hurt in part by weak results in Canadian operations 
492c0209 A sharp drop in operating profit from the Broadcasting Group\'s production company contributed to the slightly lower operating earnings overall for that segment 
492c020a [tongue_click] Kemp\'s campaign takes on an increasingly desperate tone 
492c020b In one sure sign of a candidacy in trouble he lashes out at criticism from a lightly regarded T\. V\. commentator 
492c020c Even some supporters now say privately that he should aim for the vice presidential nomination 
492c020d But his longtime hostilities with Dole leave a spot on a Bush ticket as about the only possibility 
492c020e Those lands have become worth much more than the transportation and energy concern needs for the railroad and the company had been trying to free itself from the l- liens 
492c020f Last spring Burlington agreed to pay remaining bondholders a total of thirty five \.POINT five million in return for permission to remove the covenants

492c020h After deducting nonrecurring items the U\. S\. X\. steel unit nonetheless appeared to turn in one of its most profitable quarters since the nineteen sixties 
492c020i On a per ton basis pretax profit doubled to about thirty six dollars from eighteen dollars in the third quarter 
492c020j However the performance fell far short of U\. S\. X\. Chairman David Roderick\'s prediction of fifty dollar plus per ton profit 
492c020k Texas of course is where the most trouble is to be found 
492c020l Lenders there like to blame the so called oil patch recession 
492c020m But the problem in fact is bad banking in a few cases even corrupt banking 
492c020n Some parts of Texas the Dallas Fort 
492c020o Worth area for example haven\'t had anything that legitimately could be called a recession 
492c020p The main reason so many lenders are in trouble is an old fashioned failing among bankers a weakness for real estate speculation 
492c020q As a result the government is talking of higher farm prices 
492c020r But higher farm prices would add to an already steep inflation rate 
492c020s So Beijing officials reportedly talk of tying wages to inflation an idea reminiscent of the wage indexation tried in some Latin American nations several years ago with disastrous results

492c0210 One big play last year was leisure 
492c0211 Another was undervalued assets even though no one can recall a Japanese company being broken up for its assets 
492c0212 Once you get that theme the level of the P\. \/SLASH E\. ratio doesn\'t mean a damn says Mr\. Robins 
492c0213 It\'s all a bit of a mirage 
492c0214 Yet one that so far has worked 
492c0215 But other evidence on the flaps is conflicting 
492c0216 One of the crew members can be heard on the cockpit voice recording calling out Flaps fifteen fifteen the correct position for the flaps

492c0218 What bothers these people is not that Mrs\. Thatcher poses a danger to the so called unified European market 
492c0219 Mrs\. Thatcher is not opposed to this 
492c021a Britain\'s own markets are more open than those of most European countries London is way ahead of them on capital movement having abolished exchange controls altogether 
492c021b The cause of the outrage is that European unity is the device through which the regulators and socialists hope to expand their grip on the Continent 
492c021c Now his laughter is gone 
492c021d Because of drugs he is dead 
492c021e And every day my heart breaks a little more 
492c021f On the surface the trade report looked encouraging 
492c021g The nation\'s seasonally adjusted trade deficit narrowed to eight \.POINT seventeen billion in June the lowest monthly deficit since December nineteen eighty four

492c0301 So far illegal foreign workers aren\'t taken as a job threat by Japanese workers 
492c0302 But Japanese unemployment is at historically high levels because of the yen\'s strength posing a knotty problem for the government 
492c0303 Many Japanese companies in such industries as steel and shipbuilding are cutting their labor forces 
492c0304 In the past Filipinos in many rural areas preferred the disciplined terror of the N\. P\. A\. to the random excesses of the country\'s military 
492c0305 With the change of government last year a mild improvement in military behavior and the detection of the Mindanao slaughters some Filipinos are changing their minds 
492c0306 Diplomats and political analysts say they don\'t know if the trend presages significant popular resistance to the Communists or just additional turmoil in the Philippine countryside 
492c0307 There is a wide variation in thinking about how sick one is and how important time off is in order to get well 
492c0308 The patients\' responsibilities outside of work also vary 
492c0309 It\'s hard to say to what degree these factors should influence disability status 
492c030a Most physicians probably consider them important 
492c030b In Cleveland Higbee chief executive officer Robert Broadbent says the retailer has benefited from its parent\'s financial expertise 
492c030c Although it will retain control Industrial Equity is planning to take Higbee public again probably in June

492c030e The loan is part of a seventy five million dollar plan to expand the mine\'s reserves and allow it to keep operating until nineteen ninety four 
492c030f Without the expansion the mine was threatened with closure next year 
492c030g Closure would mean the loss of seven hundred and fifteen jobs 
492c030h Administration officials are concerned by intelligence reports that suggest Iran is thinking about organizing terrorist strikes against American West European and Arab targets 
492c030i The administration has alerted embassies and military bases of an increased threat 
492c030j Administration officials say intelligence also shows that Iran has laid the groundwork for terrorism in the United States 
492c030k Within an hour Barclays P\. L\. C\. Lloyds Bank P\. L\. C\. and the London unit of Citicorp increased their base rates 
492c030l The Barclays boost took effect immediately while the other two banks\' moves were effective at the close of business

492c030s Another condition is that Topeka Group a unit of Duluth Minnesota based Minnesota Power and Light Company exercise its option to buy Deltona\'s utility subsidiaries 
492c030t Based on current book value the subsidiaries would fetch thirty two \.POINT five million in cash plus preferred stock in one of the utility units 
492c030u Topeka said it intends to exercise the option 
492c030v The biggest hurdle was to find the funds to meet the cost of reconstruction inclusive of the issue of stamps 
492c030w However the response to the government\'s international appeal for assistance has been extremely heartwarming 
492c030x The funds required for public sector assistance have been realized and the further amount required is expected to flow from the proceeds of the overseas reinsurance of property damage 
492c030y To begin with companies have been doing a good job of managing inventories 
492c030z In the past businesses have tended to become increasingly optimistic as expansions persisted 
492c0310 When sales eventually slowed inventories quickly reached excessive levels 
492c0311 Companies thereupon cut their buying industrial production declined and a recession was under way 
492c0312 Thirty one teams of nineteen representing businesses schools and assorted other groups signed up for the first local competition

492c0314 Boats full of men and women in business suits fresh from work or happy hour were not an uncommon sight 
492c0315 These mixed feelings of frustration with and gratitude toward the authorities are part of the everyday life of a foreigner doing business in Korea 
492c0316 In fact such contradictions are what seem to make the Korean world go round 
492c0317 A Western businessman needs to be ready for them 
492c0318 Here are a few hard learned facts of Korean business life 
492c0319 But many local businesses that depend on tourism aren\'t convinced 
492c031a They argue that a commercial mine might get played out in a few years 
492c031b And they fear that many tourists who trek here for the tantalizing prospect of finding a diamond in the field will take their vacations elsewhere 
492c0401 The court was split on both the Williams Act and commerce clause 
492c0402 Justice Lewis Powell acknowledged that the nineteen eighty two case of Edward versus 
492c0403 MITE suggested that any state law that favored targets more than did the Williams Act would be invalid because Congress had preempted local regulations 
492c0404 The court backtracked here to say state laws might be O\. K\. if they help the Williams Act\'s purpose by heaping even more burdens on acquirers 
492c0405 It has relieved at least some of the frustration felt by the farmers says Peter Brent a member of a farm activist group 
492c0406 If they go to mediation at least the lender has to listen 
492c0407 Nearly a dozen other states have inquired into Iowa\'s program

492c040f In reaction to the news interest rates plunged the Australian dollar firmed and analysts predicted stocks would move higher

492c040w First Boston and Xerox had no comment 
492c040x The chief operating officer would have both the footwear and apparel businesses reporting to him

492c0410 Farm futures prices have fallen several times in the past two weeks following several weeks of a drought inspired rally 
492c0411 Yesterday\'s trading seemed to support the notion among some analysts that corn and wheat futures are top heavy 
492c0412 The market has been overdone significantly on the upside said Richard Loewy senior grain and oil seed analyst with Prudential Bache Securities Incorporated 
492c0413 The piper has to be paid on the other side 
492c0414 One of the four businesses included in the lockup option granted to K\. K\. R\. is Macmillan\'s directory division which consists of Who\'s Who and National Register Publishing 
492c0415 Thus it wasn\'t immediately clear why International Thomson might be looking at the operation even though it is included in the lockup option 
492c0416 A spokesman for K\. K\. R\. also declined comment 
492c0417 The decision frees Interior officials to formally open oil company bids to lease up to five \.POINT six million acres in a salmon rich area near the Bering Sea

492c041a To be sure on a lot of scores the summit was a success 
492c041b Economic cooperation was advanced with businessmen signing agreements for about thirty contracts and several joint ventures 
492c041c Human rights too may have taken a step forward if Mr\. Gorbachev lives up to his promise to release all political prisoners by year\'s end 
492c041d In early nineteen eighty eight the political settlement envisaged by the non communists seemed plausible 
492c041e Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev was a major reason 
492c041f Mr\. Gorbachev saw the expansionist ambitions of his predecessors *stymied* by the resolute containment policy of both China and the pro Western A\. S\. E\. A\. N\. powers 
492c041g Support for the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia cost the Soviet Union economically and diplomatically 
492c041h So the Soviets trying to eliminate the military quagmire in Cambodia persuaded Hanoi\'s leaders to negotiate a military withdrawal from Cambodia

493c0207 Closely held TransAmerican said it also agreed to settle a dispute with another creditor Medallion Oil Company 
493c0208 The proposed settlements which must be approved by the bankruptcy court would remove two major hurdles in TransAmerican\'s long struggle to get out of Chapter eleven proceedings

493c020b Luckily I was able with the help of my family to get a good job and reliable child care 
493c020c But there are a lot of welfare mothers out there who aren\'t this fortunate 
493c020d A lot of women don\'t know how to get jobs or the training needed to get one and someone to watch their children

493c0210 However conventional film will be marginally profitable at best for Polaroid because initially Polaroid won\'t be manufacturing the film contends Elliott Novak an industry consultant 
493c0211 Instead it will buy the film from another company and put its name on it just as it does with videotape 
493c0212 Since it began selling videotape a few years ago Polaroid has built up an impressive twelve \%PERCENT market share making it the leader in the U\. S\. 
493c0213 But fierce competition has kept videotape profits slim and the conventional film business isn\'t likely to prove any bonanza either 
493c0214 Peter DaPuzzo head of retail trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton also looks for a sharp upward move in stock prices given a few ifs 
493c0215 One is if investors don\'t get spooked at the anniversary of the crash

493c0315 It\'s my sense that there was a time when people thought they could trade on inside information with absolute impunity 
493c0316 And that\'s no longer true 
493c0317 Now I am certain that there are still people [<misc_noise] who think they can trade on inside information and get away with it because they\'re smarter than the average person 
493c0318 There will always be those people

493c0406 Trading volume has been lethargic for the past few weeks partly reflecting confusion about the economic outlook 
493c0407 Important clues are expected to emerge Friday when the Labor Department reports employment figures for February 
493c0408 Many analysts expect the statistics to indicate that the economy remains weak and that lower interest rates lie ahead 
493c0409 But the employment statistics are very difficult to predict and individual estimates vary widely

494c020j Nevertheless some analysts say the Fed already may be tightening credit slightly 
494c020k They point to recent increases in the federal funds rate which is the rate on reserves that banks lend each other overnight 
494c020l The funds rate averaged about seven and five eighths \%PERCENT yesterday and Tuesday up from an average of seven \.POINT four three \%PERCENT in the week ended October seventh

494c0308 But the trade figures can be an even more important influence on interest rates many analysts say 
494c0309 If the January deficit turns out to be significantly larger than the approximately fourteen billion dollar gap that many analysts expect the dollar might resume its fall 
494c030a That could alarm foreign investors and discourage them from adding to their holdings of dollar denominated investments 
494c030b There\'s been a complete turnaround in short term sentiment said Thomas G\. Gribbon a senior vice president at Nomura Securities International Incorporated

494c0311 But U\. S\. manufacturers who took a beating during the first half of this decade continue to enjoy a roaring revival that began last year 
494c0312 As a result there is [door_slam>] growing evidence that factory wage and price increases are accelerating

495c020e The dollar\'s fall has pushed up the price of imports causing the deficit to swell even as the volume of non oil imports has receded

495c020l Previously sixty \%PERCENT was excluded from taxation 
495c020m Any gain credited to investors by their fund is considered realized whether the holder actually sells any fund shares or not 
495c020n Articles began appearing about the rise of the religious right a group that seemed to be dealt with more as anthropology than journalism 
495c020o After watching evangelical T\. V\. ministers Norman Lear began spending his fortune on a group called People for the American Way 
495c020p Much of this swamp creature treatment came to a head in the nineteen eighty six lawsuit over creationism and secular humanism in school texts 
495c020q The establishment made virtually no effort to push below the surface of these grievances 
495c020r It\'s a welcome development in the face of a very significant inventory overhang says Morgan Stanley\'s Mr\. Roach 
495c020s A slowing of growth in production gives companies the ability to work off some inventory

495c020u Macy is offering seventy seven dollars and thirty cents a share for eighty \%PERCENT of Federated\'s shares plus stock in a combined Federated Macy for the remainder

495c020w Macy\'s advisers however privately value it at between seventy three dollars and seventy four dollars a share or comparable to Campeau\'s proposal 
495c020x The road named West Street is a narrow strip of red gravel 
495c020y It is like the proverbial railroad tracks in America that separate the rich side of town from the poor

495c021d The Volkswagen Fox subcompact was originally brought to the U\. S\. from Brazil in nineteen eighty six as V\. W\.\'s latest attempt to market an entry level car

495c0301 I\'m very nervous because my view on rates is so close to the consensus Edward Hyman of Cyrus J\. Lawrence Incorporated says 
495c0302 Remember the consensus usually is wrong 
495c0303 The markets seem determined to make as many economists look as stupid as they possibly can 
495c0304 Defenders of the footnote argue that it makes sense as tax policy 
495c0305 Why they ask should wealthy best selling authors get substantial tax deferrals while mom and pop manufacturers for example can\'t 
495c0306 As a rule of taxes it\'s a good rule because you don\'t want people taking deductions before they get the income says one congressional aide 
495c0307 It\'s the time value of money principle 
495c0308 A French press report said the exports include sophisticated equipment for making semiconductors 
495c0309 It said the machinery may have helped the Soviets build advanced computer memories for such military purposes as missile guidance 
495c030a Western nations have reached agreements intended to forbid exports of such equipment to the Soviets 
495c030b By September the weakness of coordinated international efforts to prevent dollar declines finally surfaced 
495c030c In response to increasing inflation fears Germany and Japan began tightening monetary policy and raising interest rates 
495c030d In untimely fashion Secretary Baker reaffirmed the administration\'s intent to prevent dollar declines 
495c030e In anticipation of the substantial Fed tightening that would be necessary to prevent dollar declines U\. S\. interest rates skyrocketed

495c030g West Germany is playing for the long term says Pierre Lellouche of the French Institute for Foreign Relations 
495c030h It believes it can get East Germany back without falling under Soviet domination itself 
495c030i Mr\. Lellouche and most other Frenchmen don\'t think this is possible

495c030s White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the Reagan administration was preparing to send Congress initial informal notice of the planned sale 
495c030t Informal notification triggers a twenty day timetable after which the administration would send a formal notice

495c030v The Grand Metropolitan operations which were acquired by that company in nineteen eighty have enjoyed a good reputation in the industry 
495c030w But PepsiCo feels its territories can be better exploited due to their proximity to exisiting company owned bottlers 
495c030x It owns its Los Angeles and San Francisco bottlers for instance making the central California territory a good fit 
495c030y It also already owns its bottlers in central and northern Florida and part of Georgia 
495c030z There are some great opportunities to maximize production and marketing efficiencies the PepsiCo spokesman said 
495c0310 During any repair process blood clots are constantly being formed and dissolved 
495c0311 It is quite possible scientists speculate that during attempts to repair the artery wall the body at some point tries to dissolve a blood clot 
495c0312 But it mistakenly grabs protein a\. instead of plasminogen pulling it with its bags of fat and cholesterol into the artery wall 
495c0313 This thwarts the repair process and begins a vicious cycle drawing more and more cholesterol into the damaged area 
495c0314 And in fact microscopic blood clots and bits of L\. p\. a\. are found in the mishmash of the deposits 
495c0315 However he leaves Prime at a difficult time 
495c0316 The computer market is growing slowly and Prime\'s proprietary systems are losing ground to industry standard computers that use the Unix operating system 
495c0317 And some Wall Street Journal analysts think Prime should have cut costs more rapidly in the wake of the Computervision acquisition 
495c0318 Details are still murky about the rest of the credits 
495c0319 Italian officials say that Rome\'s decision to grant about a seven hundred and seventy five million dollar guarantee of export credit was primarily a political rather than a banking decision 
495c031a Britain\'s Midland Bank has announced plans for a number one billion credit line though some British banks may be getting cold feet about participating 
495c031b French banks have yet to announce their plans officially but are said to be considering loans of two billion dollars 
495c031c Some banking analysts doubt a London or Tokyo bank would make a similar acquisition anytime here soon 
495c031d Among other things some foreign banks have been shying away from acquiring assets in the U\. S\. because of unexpectedly high expenses managing them from afar 
495c031e Instead the trend among foreign banks is to increasingly build alliances with U\. S\. banks 
495c031f Aviation insurance is under intense pressure 
495c031g The global airline premiums have dropped to about four hundred million dollars from about one hundred billion dollars in nineteen eighty seven 
495c031h Meanwhile airline losses in nineteen eighty eight rose significantly from the previous year 
495c0401 Here are price trends on the world\'s major stock markets as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective Geneva 
495c0402 To make them directly comparable each index is based on the close of nineteen sixty nine equaling one hundred

495c040e And a Hong Kong analyst says Dragonair missed a big chance to improve on its China trade virtually at the carrier\'s inception 
495c040f Cathay originally approached Dragonair he says and suggested a *cooperative* arrangement for flights to China 
495c040g The company said Joy Technologies\' projected cash flow from operations won\'t be sufficient to satisfy its debt obligations due before June twentieth nineteen eighty nine 
495c040h As a result Joy Technologies will have to sell a number of businesses and assets

495c040j Still Mr\. Josephs and others think that the changes will be good for the farm economy in general 
495c040k Many of these gentlemen farmers were tax motivated not profit driven he says 
495c040l Some are unfair competition against the regular farmer who\'s trying to make a buck 
495c040m Yesterday the agency reversed the nineteen eighty four finding that Meredith had violated the doctrine 
495c040n The so called fairness doctrine is a misnomer said Diane Killory the agency\'s general counsel 
495c040o It promotes blandness and nothingness by chilling the very speech it was meant to foster 
495c040p In some sectors though intriguing options are springing up 
495c040q Investment consultants many of whom work for major brokerages screen money managers for potential clients 
495c040r Several have created limited partnerships that pool the money of investors with similar investment goals 
495c040s Those partnerships are then managed by individual portfolio managers 
495c040t Annual fees for such accounts however often run as high as three \%PERCENT including transaction costs 
495c040u A one hundred and fifty million dollar issue of Household Finance Corporation seven year notes was offered through underwriters led by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets 
495c040v The ten \%PERCENT notes were priced at par and the return is \.POINT seven two of a percentage point above the rate of comparable Treasury notes 
495c040w The notes are rated double A\. three by Moody\'s Investors Service Incorporated and double A\. minus by Standard and Poor\'s Corporation

495c040z Overall sales of durable goods which are intended to last three years or more fell \.POINT nine \%PERCENT after rising three \.POINT one \%PERCENT in August 
495c0410 I think the market jumped the gun on the notion of a weak economy and the Fed easing Mr\. Fine said 
495c0411 So what we\'re seeing now is a consolidation 
495c0412 He expects long term Treasury bond yields to hover around the eight and a half \%PERCENT level in the near future 
495c0413 Treasury won\'t resume trading until the Tokyo market opens Monday 
495c0414 This some analysts say may mean that the London market reaction will be confined to a brief adjustment at the opening 
495c0415 Nevertheless traders are expected to take neutral positions through the weekend just in case the difficult to forecast data produce a nasty surprise 
495c0416 If Vietnam does withdraw conditions might also become ripe for a high level summit between China and the Soviet Union 
495c0417 Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping has repeatedly said that Beijing and Moscow can\'t normalize relations until the Russian backed Vietnamese leave Cambodia 
495c0418 The U\. S\. welcomed a Beijing Moscow thaw which Washington has concluded isn\'t likely to evolve into the kind of strategic alliance they maintained in the nineteen fifties 
495c0419 The suit charges that Burger King only allows black franchisees to expand one store at a time while whites are allowed to simultaneously open multiple franchises 
495c041a Burger King also makes blacks wait three to four times longer than whites for approval of a new or expansion franchise the suit says 
495c041b The franchisees further allege that Burger King falsely and fraudulently misrepresented the sales potential of their stores 
496c0201 Alarmed by the burn throughs the F\. A\. A\. issued new rules requiring airlines to conduct frequent inspections of burner cans 
496c0202 The agency also prohibited the welding of can cracks longer than three inches 
496c0203 British Airways initiated an even tougher policy Cracked cans aren\'t welded they are replaced 
496c0204 The airline also pioneered new inspection techniques to detect cracks quickly without dismantling the engine 
496c0205 Mr\. Walter would be rich if not for his awful business sense says his brother Daniel a marketing executive 
496c0206 My mother says Go help your brother 
496c0207 I say The only way I could help him is with a garbage truck to haul away the old computer manuals that litter his apartment 
496c0208 All the gains that we\'re making are at the local level says F\. James McDonald G\. M\.\'s president 
496c0209 That may be the most important thing happening in heavy industry in the U\. S\. today 
496c020a Indeed the era of big time national labor talks in which union and management leaders butt heads over pennies an hour is waning 
496c020b Even less appreciated is the turmoil that often results for women 
496c020c \"QUOTE When he started becoming impotent I had all kinds of worries and strange thoughts \"UNQUOTE says Maggie a Boston woman who lives with her fiance 
496c020d \"QUOTE I thought I was doing something wrong or that he didn\'t love me or that he was gay \"UNQUOTE

496c020f A convention would open the door to a whole new group of leaders 
496c020g An election to choose convention delegates would be like a special election to pick a new Congress 
496c020h Under legislation passed by the Senate a constitutional convention would be made up of one member elected from each congressional district and two at large from each state 
496c020i No current members of Congress could participate 
496c020j That test was less than a complete success 
496c020k Dirt that accumulated in the kenaf during harvesting wasn\'t all removed and ended up in the paper 
496c020l The kenaf also jammed in some equipment because it had been cut in lengths that were several feet long 
496c020m By September the weakness of coordinated international efforts to prevent dollar declines finally surfaced 
496c020n In response to increasing inflation fears Germany and Japan began tightening monetary policy and raising interest rates

496c020q The seeds of market discontent were sown 
496c020r Pratt and Whitney said last week it might lay off employees after the first of the year because of decreased demand for jet engines and parts 
496c020s The company declined to discuss how many employees might be laid off or if the loss would be permanent or temporary 
496c020t But union officials said the company has tossed around numbers from sixteen hundred to two thousand 
496c020u Computervision the pioneer in the computerized design market has had poor financial results in recent years as it revamped its t- aged product line 
496c020v However recently it has reported better than expected earnings 
496c020w Although it has slipped from first to third in size in the industry it retains a substantial base of customers 
496c020x But with the imported dogs came problems 
496c020y One was cost 
496c020z Whenever they stray from the country\'s cool capital the northern bred dogs need air conditioned accommodation 
496c0210 Special vehicles have been built to squire them around 
496c0211 Each dog needs a trainer 
496c0212 A cook prepares the dog chow 
496c0213 Upkeep runs to one hundred and fifty dollars a month per canine triple the salaries of the trainers 
496c0214 Asked about a new presidential aid request Jim Wright talked about morality 
496c0215 If I schedule it the President would have some moral responsibility to help pass it he said 
496c0216 I don\'t want to run it out there and be defeated again 
496c0217 Mr\. Wright should be less timid in his convictions 
496c0218 After all he isn\'t the one who has to risk getting hit over the head with a metal pipe 
496c0219 A falling dollar is supposed to make U\. S\. imports more expensive decreasing demand for them 
496c021a But some foreign producers have been slow to adjust prices to reflect the decline in the dollar contributing to the persistent growth in U\. S\. imports 
496c021b In the past twelve months import prices have climbed seven \.POINT one \%PERCENT while the dollar has fallen nine \.POINT nine \%PERCENT 
496c021c Given the nature of our ownership it\'s obviously a very complex issue Mr\. Elish said 
496c021d There are a lot of things to consider and we\'re looking at it 
496c021e But nothing is imminent 
496c021f The deputy treasurer did it says Frank Keefe the governor\'s budget mastermind 
496c021g He obviously must be doing it because it is a prudent and professional thing to do 
496c021h As for himself Mr\. Keefe recently announced he\'s leaving his post in December 
496c021i By then the legislature which reconvenes today to pick up the budget mess will be playing what did the governor know and when did he know it 
496c0301 The word is terror 
496c0302 My fear of failure may be greater in some respects 
496c0303 People say adversity is good for you 
496c0304 Well that\'s not exactly true 
496c0305 I\'m not the same person I was 
496c0306 Transportation Department spending would fall six \%PERCENT or one \.POINT five eight billion dollars to twenty four \.POINT six three billion dollars 
496c0307 Amtrak subsidies would be eliminated and the passenger railroad\'s assets sold bringing in an estimated one billion dollars 
496c0308 But Congress is likely to balk and finding a buyer for the money losing railroad may be tough 
496c0309 The budget also would end discretionary grants for transit systems and close the Interstate Commerce Commission 
496c030a Congress has rejected similar cuts before 
496c030b Mr\. Funaro described as hot air and nonsense foreign bankers\' language in their criticism of Brazil\'s lack of economic policy 
496c030c He said nobody worried about Brazil\'s high inflation when the country was producing big surpluses to meet debt payments 
496c030d Instead of looking for excuses he said these banks should realize there\'s a debt crisis and it has to be resolved by both sides 
496c030e But the corpse was soon walking 
496c030f During the Progressive Era pressure for more federal spending developed 
496c030g In nineteen oh eight the Democratic platform backed a constitutional amendment that would allow Congress to impose a new tax directly on income 
496c030h In July nineteen oh nine Congress sent such an amendment to the states for ratification 
496c030i By early nineteen eighty six Kimberly Clark\'s resilience was being tested again 
496c030j P\. and G\. had beaten the company to the market with an extra thin diaper called Ultra Pampers 
496c030k Kimberly Clark possessed the necessary technology super absorbent polymers which replaced some of the bulky fluff and was even using it in its adult incontinence products 
496c030l But the company delayed its plans for thin baby diapers when research showed that parents didn\'t think diapers were absorbent unless they doubled the size of baby\'s bottom 
496c030m The spokesman also said the league\'s owners are committed to playing with their current replacement rosters for the rest of the season including the Super Bowl if necessary 
496c030n That may be the case if Mr\. Upshaw can be taken at his word 
496c030o He has said that the players will remain on strike for the duration if the union\'s offer was rejected 
496c030p Under terms of the original agreement Computer Memories would have issued new shares of its own in exchange for shares of closely held Hemdale 
496c030q Current Hemdale holders then would have owned about seventy eight \%PERCENT of Computer Memories\' shares 
496c030r The surviving company would have been named Hemdale Film Corporation and John Daly Hemdale\'s current chairman would have become chief executive officer of the surviving company 
496c030s Stanley Nabi executive vice president of Bessemer said They\'re not reducing their offer if you calculate the offer\'s value as of Thursday\'s close 
496c030t I figure it was worth sixty five dollars and eighty five cents a share on Thursday 
496c030u With Friday\'s revision it\'s worth sixty eight dollars a share 
496c030v The revised terms are no less attractive than the original terms in the post crash market 
496c030w The Soviets obviously want to make it as difficult as possible for NATO to carry out its modernization said one Western diplomat in Bonn 
496c030x A senior NATO diplomat accused the Soviets of trying to seduce the Germans away from us 
496c030y It is none too subtle wedge driving he told Reuters 
496c030z The forecast is a bit rosier than that of most private analysts 
496c0310 In its latest survey Blue Chip Economic Indicators consensus forecast puts growth at one \.POINT eight \%PERCENT this year 
496c0311 More than three fourths of the economists polled expect a recession to start before the end of nineteen eighty nine 
496c0312 Turnout is another unknown factor 
496c0313 To capitalize here Governor Dukakis would like to see a heavy turnout especially in such pockets of strength as the Chicago lakefront and suburbs 
496c0314 But that may not happen Illinois registration is below nineteen eighty four and no presidential candidate has yet caught fire 
496c0315 Shearson Lehman Hutton Incorporated\'s index of long term Treasury bonds fell five \.POINT six two points to twelve hundred ninety nine \.POINT five seven

496c0407 Mr\. McNay has developed a reputation as an independent no nonsense buyer of small company stocks 
496c0408 He\'s analytically tough he\'ll never take a story at its face value says a trader 
496c0409 Mr\. McNay also is respected as a manager who makes decisions quickly 
496c040a If a story makes sense Joe will be the first to put in an order the trader adds 
496c040b He brings that attitude to the office 
496c040c The lunchroom in the sprawling company office building in this north Dallas suburb has a free ice cream machine and a ten cent Coke dispenser

496c040n N\. F\. L\. teams reported thousands of requests for refunds and said they expected thousands more 
496c040o The biggest significance of the talks then may be hints for grappling with competitiveness

496c041a Her responsibility is to the voters who recognized the nation\'s desperate need for reform and gave her their mandate 
496c041b To avoid more outbursts such as Mr\. Laurel\'s it is time that Mrs\. Aquino started using that mandate

497c0219 Mr\. Bush never was strongly identified with the social conservative wing of the party 
497c021a Mr\. Reagan himself when he got in office put its issues on the back burner 
497c021b His announced purpose will be to rally the party and give a boost to the candidacy of George Bush to succeed him

497c021e But the fall of J\. Bildner is more than just another small business failure 
497c021f For one thing it\'s a spectacular small business failure 
497c021g While most young companies have so little capital that even the smallest misstep can kill them J\. Bildner was flush with cash

497c030t In Oakley Sutton\'s case the government submitted a sealed affidavit to support its request for the warrant 
497c030u According to people close to the investigation the affidavit contains information provided by a disgruntled former Oakley Sutton employee who was fired prior to the trial

497c0317 Financial history has witnessed a thousand booms and busts 
497c0318 Within recent memory we have seen the junk bond equities of the sixties the heated Third World lending of the seventies and the thrift crisis of the eighties 
497c0319 These problems of the recent past pale in scope next to the pervasiveness and total dollars involved in the current craze 
497c031a If the participants in this craze awaken now the correction may still be within tolerable limits for the country

497c040y But it still represents a limitation on the market 
497c040z Steven Einhorn chief portfolio strategist for Goldman Sachs and Company urges a more cautious approach 
497c0410 He has been arguing for months that the stock market is trapped in an economic box that will limit any rallies 
497c0411 For one thing he isn\'t yet convinced the economy is slowing

498c020t There was never any question about Mr\. Martin\'s priorities he was first of all an inflation fighter and that was certainly to the good 
498c020u But no one was ever sure just how the Fed would wage its inflation battles 
498c020v Mr\. Martin indicated he would lean against the wind when he sensed inflation coming and he did

498c021d [loud_breath] One stumbling block to increased competition is the vertical integration and cross ownership in the industry 
498c021e Cable systems often have demanded a stake in the channels they transmit 
498c021f An entrepreneur is reluctant to start an alternative cable system if he knows that he will find it difficult to gain access to programming 
498c021g Quite possibly some of the antitrust aspects of these arrangements deserve a look so it can be determined whether they act to further inhibit competition in the industry 
498c0301 [tongue_click] The market was aided by the weekend accord by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to cut production and sell oil at fixed prices

499c040z In nineteen seventy nine Winokur donated his remaining eighty \%PERCENT interest in five works the museum then took those five 
499c0410 Winokur valued the art himself and took proportional charitable deductions for each of the three years 
499c0411 The dispute is a classic confrontation between market philosophies 
499c0412 Washington believes that Japan profits from free U\. S\. markets and should reciprocate with completely free Japanese markets 
499c0413 Tokyo government bureaucrats claim to favor free markets in practice they often are loath to relinquish complete control especially in promising industries 
499c0414 Investors also prefer Remics backed by swap ten \%PERCENT securities because prepayments are less volatile 
499c0415 Freddie Mac passes through actual prepayments on swap mortgage issues while it estimates prepayments on the Cash issues 
499c0416 Prepayments on Freddie Mac Cash issues are much more volatile from month to month than prepayments on the swap issues 
499c0417 The improvement in September\'s trade deficit mostly came on the export side 
499c0418 But because of the postal strike the deadline for reporting exports was extended by two days 
499c0419 That data was also affected by the unusual amount of precious stones and aircraft related items reported in September 
499c041a Now quick recognition of losses is not only good investment strategy but good economic strategy 
499c041b Full deductibility would promote mobility of capital and efficient pricing of assets 
499c041c It would obviously promote more venture capital with high gains and high risks 
499c041d Mere indexing by contrast would help the big and dull investments with low risks and humdrum rewards

49ac0208 The color that\'s second only to green hereabouts is gray 
49ac0209 It can be found mostly on the heads of participants and spectators 
49ac020a Gains from asset sales could offset the bank\'s increased loan loss provisions in later quarters

49ac021a [tongue_click] The computer giant is mainly trying to buy technology or expertise in certain areas such as software for insurance companies in the case of its Policy Management stake 
49ac021b I\. B\. M\. also seems to be trying to buy software developers\' loyalty in the increasingly competitive industry 
49ac021c [tongue_click] Insurance coverage for small medical bills is especially wasteful 
49ac021d Usually it will cost an insurer more than fifty dollars to monitor effectively a fifty dollar physician bill thereby doubling the cost of health insurance 
49ac021e But failure to monitor encourages patients and doctors to make wasteful decisions without fear of third party scrutiny 
49ac0301 It\'s inconceivable that the directorate didn\'t know about Mr\. Rodriguez comments one international human rights worker who has studied the local refugee situation 
49ac0302 The people of El Barillo are under the boot 
49ac0303 They\'ve been smart enough to survive 
49ac0304 [tongue_click] They\'ve adapted 
49ac0305 To get its message to Madison Avenue decision makers Whittle Communications has been running a series of slick ads in newspapers and media trade journals 
49ac0306 We\'re wasting a lot of money on this ad announces a bold headline in one 
49ac0307 The point Virtually every advertiser in every medium is paying to reach viewers or readers who never become customers 
49ac0308 No other likely bidders stepped forward yesterday 
49ac0309 Hostile takeovers are almost unheard of in the defense industry 
49ac030a But analysts have speculated that either Ford Motor Company or General Electric Company might be a good fit with Boeing if the companies were interested 
49ac030b Ford for instance has indicated it is looking for acquisitions and has accumulated about nine billion dollars it could use for such purposes 
49ac030c A Ford spokesman citing company policy would neither confirm nor deny speculation about its interest 
49ac030d G\. E\. declined comment but a source close to the company said it isn\'t interested in Boeing 
49ac030e Property casualty insurer Fireman\'s Fund has since nineteen eighty three made three unforeseen additions to reserves for claims totaling more than one billion dollars 
49ac030f John Byrne Fireman\'s chairman says he\'s confident Fireman\'s is using excess resources to retire stock 
49ac030g [loud_breath] But he concedes buy backs can be risky for insurers 
49ac030h Also biotechnology companies are cash guzzlers constantly needing money for clinical trials and manufacturing facilities 
49ac030i The critical factor for most companies isn\'t how much cash they have but how it\'s being spent Mr\. MacCallum says 
49ac030j Some companies that are selling at close to their per share cash values are correctly being perceived in a skeptical light he contends 
49ac030k Mr\. Schmied is being tested early in a position he didn\'t seem eager to occupy 
49ac030l Analysts say he is an operations man who never exhibited any ambition to become chief executive 
49ac030m I never got the overwhelming sense that he was eager to succeed Mr\. Flavin says Christopher Demisch an analyst at First Boston Corp\. 
49ac030n [tongue_click] Moreover Mr\. Sawyer isn\'t thought to possess a lot of clout 
49ac030o He doesn\'t fit the boss image that the late Mayor Daley made famous and that Mayor Washington was beginning to acquire 
49ac030p He\'s a weak guy says Mr\. Rose the political consultant subject to a lot of pressure and obviously not a crusader 
49ac030q Asked how he viewed the Prudential Bache unit Mr\. Winters said Are we pleased with their results 
49ac030r [tongue_click] Of course not 
49ac030s Are we pleased with their direction 
49ac030t Yes 
49ac030u [sniff] [tongue_click] Mr\. Winters added that Prudential Bache may be more deliberate this year in some of its expansion 
49ac030v He also voiced confidence in Chairman George Ball despite the losses calling him the most qualified guy in the U\. S\. 
49ac030w For authors and publishers a new competitor in the book club field is a godsend 
49ac030x Book club rights are second only to paperback rights in providing additional revenue for publishers 
49ac030y Furthermore a book club imprimatur on a book gives it enormous cachet with bookstore managers 
49ac030z [tongue_click] Not long after the Northwest announcement the institute wired a press release to media organizations detailing the large number of passenger complaints about Northwest\'s service 
49ac0310 Airline passengers who fly Northwest appear to have a lot to complain about and they did so in droves last year the release began 
49ac0311 It went on to say that complaints against Northwest increased one thousand four hundred and eighteen \%PERCENT in the past year 
49ac0312 Many blame that change on simple geography and an effort to move away from unions 
49ac0313 But some critics also accuse the Japanese companies of deliberately avoiding blacks 
49ac0314 [tongue_click] Honda and the U\. S\. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission settled a big racial discrimination case last month 
49ac0315 The two laboratories that Nichols purchased are in Lincoln Nebraska and Sioux City Iowa 
49ac0316 [tongue_click] Initial payments for the labs totaled eleven \.POINT six million dollars in cash and preferred stock 
49ac0317 Additional payments to be made over an eight year period have a current value of six \.POINT one million dollars Nichols said 
49ac0318 The additional payments are contingent upon certain material aspects of the business of the two labs remaining intact for three years Nichols said 
49ac0319 Since Monday\'s opening bell N\. C\. N\. B\. shares have jumped four and three eighths points closing at twenty seven and seven eighths yesterday 
49ac031a Many analysts predict the stock could go higher soon perhaps crossing the thirty dollar a share barrier for the first time in a year 
49ac031b Long term bulls predict N\. C\. N\. B\.\'s price could easily double and some say triple 
49ac031c The agency has been under growing pressure from Representative John Dingell Democrat Michigan and other lawmakers to tighten regulation of the generics industry 
49ac031d Senator Orrin Hatch Republican Utah ranking minority member on the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee welcomed the plan 
49ac031e [tongue_click] It is my strong belief that sufficient evidence has been uncovered to warrant these changes he said in a statement 
49ac0401 It\'s a sad day for Wall Street said a First Boston Corp\. spokesman 
49ac0402 Stock traders cautioned that the government hasn\'t yet won convictions on its latest cases 
49ac0403 [tongue_click] But both lawmakers and stock market professionals said yesterday\'s arrests send a clear signal An overhaul of takeover and securities practices has become increasingly likely 
49ac0404 Senator William Proxmire Democrat Wisconsin sharply criticized the Fed for dropping the M\. one target 
49ac0405 He also contended that it is an extremely dangerous and unwise policy to allow M\. one to expand as rapidly as it has 
49ac0406 Last year M\. one which consists of checking deposits plus cash held by the public soared fifteen \.POINT two \%PERCENT 
49ac0407 That was far above the Fed\'s target of three \%PERCENT to eight \%PERCENT 
49ac0408 When Hu Yaobang was dumped in January as the Communist Party\'s secretary general Mr\. Zhao was elevated to that post on an acting basis 
49ac0409 That made Mr\. Zhao a protege of Deng Xiaoping the de facto head of the party as well as the government 
49ac040a It is a delicate position requiring him to maneuver among various interest groups and personal cliques that make up China\'s top leadership 
49ac040b Some have characterized our countermeasures as protectionist brought about because of congressional pressures 
49ac040c That is dead wrong 
49ac040d We have been in consultations with Japan on this issue since November long before present trade legislation was introduced 
49ac040e The president\'s action was the culmination of that process and it had nothing whatsoever to do with trade bills 
49ac040f President Reagan believes that people and nations should honor their obligations 
49ac040g There is nothing protectionist about that 
49ac040h The one hundred share index closed ten \.POINT six points higher at twenty two seventy one \.POINT eight 
49ac040i The Financial Times thirty share index rose eleven \.POINT six to seventeen seventy five \.POINT four 
49ac040j The gold mines index fell three \.POINT five to four forty nine \.POINT five 
49ac040k Volume was light at four fifty four \.POINT six million shares compared with seven fifty one \.POINT four million Friday 
49ac040l The clearest indication of Japan\'s biotechnology ambitions may be the attention being given the field by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
49ac040m When M\. I\. T\. I\. gets involved it\'s a safe bet the nation\'s senior strategists have targeted an industry for a big push 
49ac040n Though M\. I\. T\. I\. does some biotech research its main role is to spur and guide work by others 
49ac040o Like a fishing boat tossing chum in the water it first charts a course and then plants money to attract more 
49ac040p James Mahoney Mr\. Carson\'s spokesman says the split with Mr\. Bushkin occurred after Mr\. Carson decided to sell his television production business 
49ac040q [tongue_click] There aren\'t any financial irregularities he says 
49ac040r They differed on the manner in which his companies were being sold 
49ac040s Mr\. Carson is said to have decided to sell Carson Productions piecemeal instead of as a going concern 
49ac040t Mr\. Bushkin reportedly favored keeping the company whole rather than auctioning individual assets 
49ac040u Fresh faces appear at the Rainbow Kitchen almost daily among them a young couple back from a disillusioning job hunting sojourn to the Sun Belt 
49ac040v They expect to be on their feet in a month 
49ac040w Others show up between odd jobs or in the summer when their children can\'t get free lunch at school 
49ac040x He scored a big triumph early this year pushing aside local bureaucrats who wanted to share his spoils in a one billion dollar freeway being built in Guangdong province 
49ac040y His weapon the personal blessing of Communist Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang 
49ac040z At the April opening of a five hundred twelve \.POINT eight million dollar Guangdong power plant officialdom heaped praise on Mr\. Wu for beating a construction deadline 
49ac0410 Indonesia and the Philippines are so impressed that they have asked him to build similar plants 
49ac0411 Many admirers believe firmly that if anyone can get business done in China Mr\. Wu can 
49ac0412 Taekwondo looks kind of like karate so I asked a Korean official for an explanation of the differences between the two sports 
49ac0413 Taekwondo is Korean 
49ac0414 Karate is Japanese he snapped and turned away 
49ac0415 Mr\. Papageorge said These were conceptual negotiations 
49ac0416 Ideas were flowing 
49ac0417 We were seeing what worked for each of us 
49ac0418 The two of us were trying to think of a way to satisfy everyone 
49ac0419 But it\'s what this election is all about 
49ac041a The real question on the ballot is Should the Reagan Years continue beyond the Reagan years 
49ac041b Beyond the Bush years 
49ac041c Beyond even the Quayle years 
49ac041d The Supreme Court will determine that and the next president will determine the court\'s makeup for at least another generation 
49ac041e Warner Lambert and Schering Plough are coveted for their over the counter drugs as well as for prescription sales 
49ac041f Over the counter drugs such as Warner Lambert\'s Listerine mouthwash are thought to have franchise value 
49ac041g They aren\'t research intensive they\'re marketing intensive one analyst said 
49bc0201 [tongue_click] The sale of the hotels is part of Holiday\'s strategy to sell off assets and concentrate on property management 
49bc0202 The hotel operator\'s Embassy Suites Hotels Incorporated subsidiary [loud_breath] will continue to manage the properties [loud_breath] 
49bc0203 Long term management contracts allow us to generate income on a significantly lower capital base [loud_breath] said Michael D\. Rose Holiday\'s chairman and chief executive officer 
49bc0204 [tongue_click] Albert Halprin chief of the F\. C\. C\.\'s common carrier bureau said he hadn\'t seen the consumer group\'s study [loud_breath] 
49bc0205 He said previous studies by the group had focused on flat rate service for local calls 
49bc0206 Mr\. Halprin conceded that such rates had risen sharply but he added that phone companies now offer a variety of local telephone plans at differing prices [loud_breath] 
49bc0207 Around that time Mr\. Genger also met with Mr\. el Sayed 
49bc0208 He surfaced to meet with Genger after Genger had made the approach to the company said Mr\. Trotman the Drexel Burnham banker 
49bc0209 I think he was trying to find a way back in 
49bc020a But Mr\. Trotman said Mr\. el Sayed isn\'t involved in the Trans Resources bid [loud_breath] 
49bc020b Instead Mr\. Reagan agreed to lower the volume of his comments supporting the Contras and criticizing the Democratic controlled [loud_breath] Congress 
49bc020c He also would hold off on any new proposals for Contra military aid until September thirtieth 
49bc020d If the Sandinista government had made significant democratic reforms and a ceasefire was in place Mr\. Reagan would end his Contra military aid program 
49bc020e [loud_breath] In Korea labor conflicts have added heat to the unstable political situation 
49bc020f The new unions are growing more adversarial 
49bc020g Companies keep asking the government to smash the unions 
49bc020h But the ruling party can\'t risk alienating workers who will vote in the coming elections 
49bc020i It refuses so far to backtrack on its July first promise of greater democracy or to return to the policy of overt union busting 
49bc020j In a nineteen seventy eight seventy nine administrative proceeding [loud_breath] the S\. E\. C\.\'s enforcement division pressed for Mr\. Kobrin\'s permanent expulsion from the securities business 
49bc020k The division argued that stock manipulation of the kind he had been engaged in went to the heart of the securities laws 
49bc020l The division also said the law directed the S\. E\. C\. to act on the belief that past misconduct raised a risk of future misconduct [loud_breath] that might justify expulsion 
49bc020m Certainly foreign competition and a changing world economy have exacted a heavy toll on our nation\'s manufacturing industries 
49bc020n However many of these industries have survived and are now as tough and lean as they\'ve ever been 
49bc020o The managers of these companies have learned through hard experience about exactly which investments pay off 
49bc020p Although airlines deny handling complaints differently they make no apologies about favoring frequent fliers in other ways [loud_breath] 
49bc020q [tongue_click] They say they are only trying to boost membership in these programs which airlines consider crucial for developing brand loyalty 
49bc020r These are our most important customers says a United spokesman 
49bc020s [tongue_click] Mr\. Antoniu\'s fall and surprising rebound prove there is life after insider trading 
49bc020t But his story also suggests that some character traits that may give rise to insider trading can be hard to change 
49bc020u Insider trading is a form of fraud and some Sport About franchises now claim they have been defrauded by Mr\. Antoniu 
49bc020v Still traders were encouraged by investor reaction to this week\'s Treasury financing especially yesterday\'s thirty year bond sale 
49bc020w We thought there was very broad Japanese participation in the bond auction said Mr\. Lakefield of Shearson Lehman [loud_breath] 
49bc020x But the real question is whether the Japanese bought for short term trading accounts or for long term investment 
49bc020y Individual investors looking for some excitement in their lives aren\'t likely to be enthralled by Mr\. Berg\'s advice 
49bc020z He suggests that they drop their hard earned dollars into the most conservative of investments T\. bills and sit tight [loud_breath] 
49bc0210 There\'s no sense trying to play games with this market Mr\. Berg explains 
49bc0211 Things are a bit duller this year 
49bc0212 Mr\. Bilzerian has sent his boy to a Little League team in faraway Minnesota where the family spends its summers and isn\'t coaching a team this year 
49bc0213 All the action apparently will be in the courtroom 
49bc0214 The Grand Metropolitan operations which were acquired by that company in nineteen eighty have enjoyed a good reputation in the industry 
49bc0215 But PepsiCo feels its territories can be better exploited due to their proximity to exisiting company owned bottlers 
49bc0216 It owns its Los Angeles and San Francisco bottlers for instance making the central California territory a good fit [loud_breath] 
49bc0217 It also already owns its bottlers in central and northern Florida and parts of Georgia 
49bc0218 [tongue_click] There are some great opportunities to maximize production and marketing efficiencies the PepsiCo spokesman said 
49bc0219 Peter DaPuzzo head of retail trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton [loud_breath] also looks for a sharp upward move in stock prices given a few ifs 
49bc021a One is if investors don\'t get spooked at the anniversary of the crash 
49bc021b Another is if the Federal Reserve eases interest rates 
49bc021c [tongue_click] And a third is if George Bush wins the presidential election 
49bc021d [loud_breath] But Service Merchandise jumped one and three eighths to eighteen <and> <a> and a quarter on one \.POINT four million shares 
49bc021e The stock slid to twelve and a quarter in September after the company announced that an investor group had decided not to proceed with a possible acquisition offer 
49bc021f Since then the stock has been rising on takeover rumors 
49bc0301 [tongue_click] When Hu Yaobang was dumped in January as the Communist Party\'s secretary general [loud_breath] Mr\. Zhao was elevated to that post on an acting basis 
49bc0302 That made Mr\. Zhao a protege of Deng Xiaoping the de facto head of the party as well as the government [loud_breath] 
49bc0303 [tongue_click] It is a delicate position requiring him to maneuver among various interest groups and personal cliques that make up China\'s top leadership [loud_breath] 
49bc0304 PaineWebber itself hasn\'t been charged with wrongdoing 
49bc0305 The firm a unit of PaineWebber Group Incorporated released a short statement yesterday in which it said the two men have been suspended indefinitely 
49bc0306 The firm has cooperated with the U\. S\. Attorney\'s office throughout the investigation and will continue to do so 
49bc0307 Then there are utility stocks 
49bc0308 The Nasdaq Utility Index jumped eighteen \%PERCENT in the first quarter while indexes of listed utility stocks rose barely three \%PERCENT 
49bc0309 But in fact most of the fifty five electric gas and water utility stocks on Nasdaq performed much like their counterparts on the major exchanges 
49bc030a Producers however say the guild demand really represents an effort to squeeze in more than one session a day 
49bc030b The actors are paid by the [<door_slam] session not by the hour and both sides agree that sessions rarely exceed three hours 
49bc030c [tongue_click] And with the guild choosing such a critical time for the strike T\. V\. production officials are especially irate [loud_breath] 
49bc030d When my family fled we left my nanny in charge of the house 
49bc030e [tongue_click] But soon a lieutenant in the revolutionary army evicted her and installed his mistress 
49bc030f Later the house went to the North Koreans [loud_breath] 
49bc030g F\. D\. A\. researchers say they don\'t know much yet about the long term effects of fat substitutes mixing with medication and other substances 
49bc030h Typically lab tests on food products are for the life cycle of rats or mice about four years 
49bc030i Researchers say they aren\'t sure such tests parallel human consumption of fat over longer periods 
49bc030j We just don\'t know says the F\. D\. A\.\'s Mr\. Mertz 
49bc030k With every new development there are risks 
49bc030l [loud_breath] [tongue_click] Announcement of the talks surprised analysts and failed to impress investors 
49bc030m British Aerospace shares fell twenty five pence or forty four cents to three hundred and twenty nine pence in late trading yesterday on London\'s stock exchange 
49bc030n The handful of Rover shares trading jumped nineteen pence to eighty six pence after the announcement but fell back to [door_slam>] eighty two pence 
49bc030o [tongue_click] Mr\. Thayer said Mr\. Young received a lump sum payment to settle his contract with Gibraltar Financial [loud_breath] but wouldn\'t disclose the amount [sniff] [loud_breath] 
49bc030p Mr\. Young\'s contract which ran until January twenty fourth nineteen ninety one called for a salary of at least four hundred and ten thousand dollars a year 
49bc030q In nineteen eighty six Mr\. Young was paid five hundred and fifty thousand five hundred and ninety six dollars 
49bc030r As a recent visit revealed the soup kitchen has become a powerful magnet drawing hundreds who come for more than just daily nourishment 
49bc030s Mr\. Kovacs an octogenarian who croons love ballads to anyone who will listen comes for camaraderie 
49bc030t For George a middle aged retarded man the kitchen is a lifeline 
49bc030u He arrived five years ago picked up a broom and without saying a word started cleaning up he now gets paid the minimum wage 
49bc030v The offer is a brilliant defense contrived by Santa Fe\'s investment bankers at Salomon Brothers [door_slam>] and Goldman Sachs 
49bc030w The sixty three dollar a share price will hang over the negotiations like smog over Los Angeles 
49bc030x And though Mr\. Dingman will offer package after package that seems to add up to sixty three dollars he doesn\'t really plan to meet the asking price 
49bc030y Instead he hopes to persuade Santa Fe to take less 
49bc030z For one hundred years Wyoming has been riding a roller coaster 
49bc0310 When commodity prices rise people rush to Wyoming for short term work at boom town pay 
49bc0311 [cross_talk] Government revenues largely underwritten by energy company taxes explode 
49bc0312 [tongue_click] When commodity prices sour people pull out often with their mobile homes trailing behind 
49bc0313 And revenues slump 
49bc0314 The reason for the relatively modest incentive programs is that the auto makers are demonstrating a much better ability to keep production in line with sales 
49bc0315 [lip_smack] Inventories of U\. S\. made cars stood at fifty nine days supply at the end of August according to Ward\'s Automotive Reports an industry trade publication 
49bc0316 That is considered a normal supply and it is the lowest stock in twenty two months 
49bc0317 Takeover talk aroused interest in two financial concerns 
49bc0318 Mercantile Bancorp soared five and a half to thirty and three quarters on renewed buy out speculation [loud_breath] 
49bc0319 Sun State Savings and Loan ended at eight and a quarter up two after confirming that it received an unsolicited acquisition proposal from an investment group 
49bc031a In Houston a Coastal spokesman said the fight isn\'t over 
49bc031b We anticipate asking for a rehearing or appealing to the Supreme Court the spokesman said 
49bc031c He added We were quite surprised by the reversal 
49bc031d We thought we had a solid case 
49bc0401 [loud_breath] I\'ve been trying to live my life by an idea she says pointing to a video game 
49bc0402 See that machine [loud_breath] 
49bc0403 That\'s an idea 
49bc0404 Rock and roll 
49bc0405 That\'s an idea 
49bc0406 In heavy trading Friday profit taking caused the Nikkei average to slip seventy \.POINT one eight to twenty one thousand one hundred five \.POINT eight five 
49bc0407 [tongue_click] The decline snapped a string of five record closings [other_mouth_sound] 
49bc0408 The stock exchange index fell twelve \.POINT nine two points to one thousand eight hundred sixteen \.POINT six nine [loud_breath] 
49bc0409 Volume totaled about one billion shares 
49bc040a Mr\. Abboud also gained a reputation during the First Chicago years as being abrasive and sometimes harsh with subordinates and that tag has lingered 
49bc040b I\'ve never seen an adjective used so much in connection with a person\'s name he said in a nineteen eighty four interview [sniff] 
49bc040c [tongue_click] People think the A in A\. Robert Abboud stands for abrasive [loud_breath] 
49bc040d In Amsterdam stocks closed lower in volatile trading 
49bc040e [tongue_click] Selected issues ended off their intraday lows though after Wall Street\'s lower opening proved less severe than some Dutch forecasters anticipated dealers said [loud_breath] 
49bc040f Volatile trading throughout the session produced wide price fluctuations as Dutch institutions bargain hunted while overseas investors tended to sell shares 
49bc040g Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value 
49bc040h Thus higher bidding narrows the investor\'s return while lower bidding widens it [loud_breath] 
49bc040i The percentage rates are calculated on a three hundred sixty day year while the coupon equivalent yield is based on a three hundred sixty five day year 
49bc040j Technically the stopgap bill will leave the government out of money over the weekend 
49bc040k But that should have little practical effect since most operations will be closed during that time 
49bc040l [tongue_click] [loud_breath] Congressional leaders hope however it will pressure lawmakers to finish their work before Monday 
49bc040m Some months before the crash interest rates started to move up 
49bc040n Home mortgage rates went up almost ten times as fast as they came down 
49bc040o The money supply growth was muddling at or below the lower end of the target range a phenomenon we have not experienced for many years 
49bc040p For a ship or missile guided by the wrong time signal that little gap could mean arriving at the wrong destination 
49bc040q If we let the difference grow says Mr\. McCarthy we could run into problems over thousands of years 
49bc040r It might be noon by atomic time but dark outside 
49bc040s This heady mixture of piety and gutter fighting we fear is [misc_noise>] likely to detract from causes we would like to advance 
49bc040t This is perfectly illustrated by Mr\. Robertson\'s charge that there are Russian intermediate range missiles in Cuba 
49bc040u It is perfectly true that the I\. N\. F\. treaty gives us no rights to inspect for missiles in the Soviet\'s island satellite 
49bc040v And it is true that Soviet bases there are a danger to the U\. S\. 
49bc040w But to pose these valid issues in the most inflammatory way Mr\. Robertson has charged that the missiles are already deployed and in place 
49bc040x If this is presented as the issue the answer is no and the valid points are lost 
49bc040y Kaiser\'s present value is equally uncertain the company estimates that its net worth is at least a negative five hundred million dollars 
49bc040z In its lawsuits against former management the company is seeking damages of more than three hundred million dollars for alleged self dealing and mismanagement 
49bc0410 In the process the suits allege assets were overstated and liabilities understated 
49bc0411 The shortage of Western capacity makes Soviet launchers attractive 
49bc0412 A series of launch disasters including the Challenger explosion severely curtailed Western access to space in nineteen eighty six to eighty seven 
49bc0413 The European Ariane launcher just returned to commercial service 
49bc0414 The U\. S\. space program will not eliminate its backlog of payloads until the early nineteen nineties 
49bc0415 You think that\'s weird 
49bc0416 [loud_breath] [tongue_click] Think again 
49bc0417 He\'s not alone [loud_breath] 
49bc0418 Carbide\'s sabotage theory is weakened partly because it hasn\'t disclosed all its evidence 
49bc0419 Though its attorneys say they have interviewed the alleged saboteur [loud_breath] extensively they won\'t disclose his name or whereabouts or describe him 
49bc041a They also decline to say whether they understand his motives or have any witnesses 
49bc041b The one element of suspense remains the selection of a running mate for Vice President Bush\'s presidential campaign 
49bc041c Bush managers insist they won\'t disclose the vice presidential nominee\'s identity until Thursday morning 
49bc041d Reagan arrived at the convention site last night and prepared for his farewell speech to the party tonight 
49bc041e The president leaves for California tomorrow and Bush will arrive to take control of the convention 
49bc041f It is a crucial time in which Bush must attempt to move out from under Reagan\'s shadow and establish his own identity 
49cc0201 Phil Walters whose back yard would have faced the proposed shelter says he went to meetings to learn both sides of the shelter debate 
49cc0202 But just for wanting to hear the pros and cons I became a pro derelict revolutionary in the eyes of some people he recalls 
49cc0203 They didn\'t want an objective study 
49cc0204 They just wanted to prevent the onslaught of the bums

49cc020n Moreover a Western firm has to make some calculation of whether Mr\. Gorbachev will succeed in his efforts to activate the Soviet work force 
49cc020o Past experience and current reports indicate that his chances aren\'t good 
49cc020p Rowland Evans and Robert Novak reported from Moscow last week that party apparatchiks and disaffected Soviet workers already are undermining reforms 
49cc020q The government faces a knotty surplus problem 
49cc020r U\. S\. storage bins hold roughly an eight month supply of corn and a ten month supply of wheat when a three month supply would do 
49cc020s Making matters worse the harvest ripening in the fields promises to be a monster portending record post harvest supplies of corn and a glut of other commodities

49cc020u Humana tried to defend itself through diversification as did the other large chains Hospital Corporation of America American Medical International *Incorporated* and National Medical Enterprises *Incorporated*

49cc020w The patient pool might shrink but the company could grab a bigger part of it 
49cc020x Kemp\'s campaign takes on an increasingly desperate tone 
49cc020y In one sure sign of a candidacy in trouble he lashes out at criticism from a lightly regarded T\. V\. commentator 
49cc020z Even some supporters now say privately that he should aim for the vice presidential nomination 
49cc0210 But his longtime hostilities with Dole leave a spot on a Bush ticket as about the only possibility 
49cc0211 We never had one before Mr\. Timbers said 
49cc0212 A certain percentage of our clients would like to have that option 
49cc0213 It\'s not necessarily a market call 
49cc0214 Mr\. Timbers says he\'s fairly ambivalent about the price of gold near term 
49cc0215 He does see however higher inflation of five \%PERCENT or so in nineteen eighty nine up from four \%PERCENT this year 
49cc0216 A gold option could be a nice alternative for fixed income investors should inflation fears arise Mr\. Timbers says 
49cc0217 But he warns that companies should ask how much stock is too much 
49cc0218 A director holding a large block may become more interested in short term results than long term corporate health

49cc0302 That may be the most important thing happening in heavy industry in the U\. S\. today

49cc030l It was true yesterday it is true today and it remains true for the company\'s strategic future he said 
49cc030m Some issuers also are wary of doing away with outside counsel 
49cc030n In Washington state a proposal to use the attorney general as counsel on all state bond issues came before a legislative committee last year 
49cc030o Its adoption would have saved Washington more than two hundred thousand dollars a year 
49cc030p Strong opposition from the attorney general\'s office defeated the proposal however 
49cc030q Mr\. Moreland couldn\'t be reached for comment but attorneys representing him have previously denied he committed any acts of fraud 
49cc030r An attorney for Mr\. Reynolds in San Diego said we feel our client did nothing in violation of the securities laws

49cc030t Grains and soybeans The threat of rain and favorable spring planting conditions pushed soybean and corn futures prices lower 
49cc030u The latest weather forecast calls for fairly good moisture in Midwest farming states over the next six to ten days

49cc030y Further signs of strong U\. S\. economic growth are expected to emerge from a Labor Department report next Friday on the nation\'s employment picture for August 
49cc030z If so Federal Reserve officials may raise short term interest rates further within a few weeks several analysts said 
49cc0310 They also predicted that banks will raise their prime or base rates again to ten and a half \%PERCENT or eleven \%PERCENT from the current ten \%PERCENT level 
49cc0311 The study was part of Cornell\'s response to calls by local politicians that it should help more in Tompkins County

49cc0318 Los Angeles based Unocal Corporation with extensive refining and marketing activities on the West Coast long has been seen as a possible acquisition target 
49cc0319 Buying Unocal also could give B\. P\. a needed boost in its natural gas reserves 
49cc031a Other takeover possibilities include Phillips Petroleum Company of *Bartlesville* Oklahoma and New York based Amerada Hess Corporation 
49cc031b As a result it can make sales in keeping with market conditions without having a significant effect on its economy Mr\. Nichols said 
49cc031c Last year it estimated the Soviet Union made between two hundred twenty million and two hundred thirty million dollars from sales of palladium 
49cc031d It made billions on gold 
49cc0401 The department also said that productivity for nonfinancial companies increased at a zero \.POINT three \%PERCENT annual rate in the third quarter a preliminary estimate 
49cc0402 The estimate is based on an increase of output of one \.POINT four \%PERCENT and an increase in hours worked of one \.POINT one \%PERCENT 
49cc0403 This was the first quarter in which productivity increased in the nonfinancial sector since the third quarter of nineteen eighty five 
49cc0404 In recent years however insider trading cases have sometimes involved people who are quite remote from companies that are the subject of inside information 
49cc0405 Since nineteen eighty the Supreme Court has suggested without being specific that such cases might involve misappropriation or illegal use of information 
49cc0406 A decision in the Winans case may help define securities fraud by misappropriation 
49cc0407 These teens crave excitement 
49cc0408 They spurn rest and recreation 
49cc0409 They dream about power and pots of money 
49cc040a Especially money 
49cc040b Last month Piedmont\'s board recommended that the company accept Norfolk Southern\'s bid to acquire the company for sixty five *dollars* a share 
49cc040c Norfolk Southern has had a stake in Piedmont since nineteen eighty one 
49cc040d But one day after the board\'s recommendation U\. S\. Air sweetened its initial bid for Piedmont forcing the board to drop its recommendation 
49cc040e Inco\'s stock has caught technical analysts\' attention too 
49cc040f It recently broke out of a five year trading range says Martin Pring editor of Pring Market Review 
49cc040g He thinks the stock could be poised for gains reflecting what may be a bull market in base metals 
49cc040h Was that the earth shifting in Mike Kinsley\'s Viewpoint column yesterday on the page opposite A *Democrats\'* Guide to Robert Bork 
49cc040i Mr\. Kinsley called the Roe v\. 
49cc040j Wade abortion decision one of the judicial excesses of activist judges 
49cc040k Then we found ourselves described as the center of conservative intellectual hypocrisy on judicial restraint 
49cc040l We believe we\'re coming to understand the meaning of neoliberal an ex liberal who attacks conservatives in the process of adopting their positions 
49cc040m The finding uniformly surprised longtime researchers in the field 
49cc040n There is a scientific rationale behind T\. H\. A\. says Doctor Leon Thal a researcher at San Diego Veterans Administration Hospital 
49cc040o But the results were overwhelming and when you get results like that out of the blue the first reaction is to be skeptical 
49cc040p That test was less than a complete success 
49cc040q Dirt that accumulated in the kenaf during harvesting wasn\'t all removed and ended up in the paper 
49cc040r The kenaf also jammed in some equipment because it had been cut in lengths that were several feet long 
49cc040s Representative Foley said there was general agreement that a deficit reduction package should consist half of spending cuts and half revenue raising measures 
49cc040t But negotiators still couldn\'t agree on what constitutes revenue raisers or spending cuts 
49cc040u House Republican Leader Robert Michel of Illinois complained I\'m just asking the Democrats to give us real savings 
49cc040v Most Arab states broke off relations with Egypt when the country signed a peace treaty with Israel eight years ago

49cc0413 Jackson received fourteen delegates and Gore got none 
49cc0414 All three candidates continued campaigning in New York for tomorrow\'s primary election 
49cc0415 Even after finding a buyer completing a foreclosure sale is hardly routine 
49cc0416 Brokers at Merrill Lynch Realty recall a sale that was delayed for a month by a one million dollar Internal Revenue Service lien on the property 
49cc0417 Another sale was delayed when the lender discovered that the owner had died between the time the property was posted for foreclosure and the foreclosure was completed 
49cc0418 We were at the closing table when this all came out says Wanda Hutchins the Merrill Lynch agent 
49cc0419 Invalid foreclosures are one of the biggest problems we have 
49cc041a The lower volatility could be especially important right now when the course of interest rates seems especially cloudy 
49cc041b While interest rates have been declining recently many economists expect rates to rise by year end 
49cc041c After that however they say rates could fall again perhaps sharply as economic growth slows in nineteen eighty nine 
49cc041d The most widely used estrogen product in the U\. S\. is sold under the brand name Premarin by American Home Products Corporation\'s Wyeth Ayerst Laboratories 
49cc041e In nineteen eighty eight sales of Premarin largely to prevent osteoporosis jumped twenty six \%PERCENT to two hundred and thirty six million dollars 
49cc041f A spokeswoman for the company said Premarin isn\'t currently indicated for use in preventing heart disease but the company is researching the matter 
49dc0201 The accord most likely would include some private agreement among ministers on how far up or down these rates can move and still be acceptable 
49dc0202 But officials said it is unlikely these limits would be made public 
49dc0203 [tongue_click] And it isn\'t known yet whether the major powers would pledge to intervene in currency markets if exchange rates were to exceed those limits 
49dc0204 How is Wall Street reacting to the changes 
49dc0205 Some investment bankers feel threatened by it others scoff at suggestion that these efforts are truly competitive 
49dc0206 But some say the case isn\'t clear 
49dc0207 Few developers are big enough to justify the cost of these divisions 
49dc0208 The test will be whether the new units are adding value to their organizations 
49dc0209 If not one investment banker says the partners will kill them 
49dc020a In Cleveland Higbee chief executive officer Robert Broadbent says the retailer has benefited from its parent\'s financial expertise 
49dc020b Although it will retain control Industrial Equity is planning to take Higbee public again probably in June 
49dc020c Meanwhile says Mr\. Broadbent They\'ve made us more inquisitive about acquisitions ourselves 
49dc020d Despite worries about investment bankers lending money for buyouts Morgan Stanley did better than Owens Illinois\' public bondholders will do 
49dc020e Annualized it earns eighty \%PERCENT pre tax on its three month three hundred million dollar loan to Owens Illinois Mr\. Niehaus says 
49dc020f That includes interest of ten million dollars and investment banking fees of fifty million dollars 
49dc020g Thirteen years ago Mr\. Smith was mired in personal bankruptcy proceedings 
49dc020h Now he lives like a successful corporate executive 
49dc020i But there is a difference 
49dc020j His is a tax exempt not for profit corporation dedicated to helping minors the sick and the needy 
49dc020k It also has greatly helped the Smith family 
49dc020l Last year the corporation paid the Smiths and a son in law more than three hundred and forty eight thousand dollars in salaries and bonuses 
49dc020m Mr\. Smith also had an outstanding unsecured personal loan of a hundred and twelve thousand dollars and enjoyed other perquisites 
49dc020n As for the board of directors that authorizes all this well four Smiths husband wife and two children currently are the board of directors 
49dc020o U\. S\. utilities could also increase orders of foreign uranium ahead of any total import restrictions analysts say 
49dc020p Uranium from South Africa for example has already fallen under anti apartheid sanctions 
49dc020q But last year said the Uranium Institute U\. S\. imports of South African uranium surged three hundred \%PERCENT to more than thirteen \.POINT two million pounds 
49dc020r Almost sixty \%PERCENT of the deliveries took place in December nineteen eighty six the last month before the embargo took effect 
49dc020s Rorer Group whose stock eased three eighths to thirty five and three quarters said it signed a definitive agreement to acquire A\. H\. Robins 
49dc020t The agreement is a key part of Robins\'s bankruptcy reorganization plan 
49dc020u [door_slam] Robins jumped one and a half to twenty one 
49dc020v Some critics see the growth control movement as the indulgence of a self satisfied middle class 
49dc020w And some charge that there are racist roots 
49dc020x The fact is that a lot of people don\'t like seeing Hispanics and Asians around says Daniel Garcia the president of the Los Angeles Planning Commission 
49dc020y The dirt road comes to a paved intersection and Mr\. Kgori begins a right turn 
49dc020z Up ahead he spots a roadblock where a white policeman with a dog is holding up three blacks traveling on a donkey pulled wagon 
49dc0210 Mr\. Kgori decides to go straight on the dirt road even though it will take him an hour out of his way 
49dc0211 That was illustrated by a temporary surge in securities lending during last October\'s crash and a previous securities settlement backlog in Britain 
49dc0212 Said one U\. K\. monetary official Clearly there was demand in the market for more equities money broking 
49dc0213 What you are seeing with Shearson\'s move is a reflection of that demand 
49dc0214 Some banking analysts doubt a London or Tokyo bank would make a similar acquisition anytime here soon 
49dc0215 Among other things some foreign banks have been shying away from acquiring assets in the U\. S\. because of unexpectedly high expenses managing them from afar 
49dc0216 Instead the trend among foreign banks is to increasingly build alliances with U\. S\. banks

49dc021d [loud_breath] The suits seek damages of the difference between the offering price and the market price when the suits were filed 
49dc021e To the extent that export growth continues it will keep the U\. S\. economy from slipping added Mr\. Witten 
49dc021f So you can have a soft landing scenario based on expanding exports 
49dc021g A soft landing combines moderate economic growth with low inflation 
49dc0301 Prices moved up in response to news that U\. S\. durable goods orders declined seven \.POINT five \%PERCENT in January 
49dc0302 Prices also slid after the release of the Tower Commission report on the Reagan administration\'s involvement in the Iran Contra affair 
49dc0303 But by late in the session issues had firmed again 
49dc0304 Mr\. Epstein said he set some very short range goals to help Penril get back into the black 
49dc0305 His plans include restructuring some debt and selling one of the company\'s five divisions to help generate enough capital to finance the growth of the other four 
49dc0306 He declined to identify the division that will be sold 
49dc0307 The look and feel cases are generating controversy in the industry 
49dc0308 Companies bringing the suits say they are defending the rewards due those who develop innovative software from companies that are selling cut rate copies 
49dc0309 But others argue that new software always borrows from the old [misc_noise] 
49dc030a They say Lotus if its suit succeeds will stifle innovation and discourage the spread of standards that help computer users master software [<door_slam] made by different companies

49dc030k Political observers theorize that the political rehabilitation is linked to this invisible presidential race 
49dc030l Some say for instance that Mr\. de la Madrid put the former minister on display to goad other candidates into working harder 
49dc030m Others suggest that one presidential hopeful is using the popular Mr\. Silva Herzog to undermine his rivals 
49dc030n The most provocative hypothesis has it that Mr\. Silva Herzog has himself become a candidate again 
49dc030o We are aware of our international obligations and we willingly accept them the banker observes 
49dc030p But the Bundesbank he asserts has to be very cautious in setting its monetary policy

49dc030r Mr\. Wright didn\'t list those earnings on nineteen eighty seven personal finance disclosure forms 
49dc030s Attorney Daniel Swillinger said at a minimum he should have disclosed this the six thousand five hundred dollar escrow as an asset 
49dc030t Mr\. Swillinger counseled Representative Newt Gingrich Republican Georgia on the drafting of a complaint against Mr\. Wright that helped touch off the ethics investigation 
49dc030u The one element of suspense remains the selection of a running mate for Vice President Bush\'s presidential campaign 
49dc030v Bush managers insist they won\'t disclose the vice presidential nominee\'s identity until Thursday morning 
49dc030w Reagan arrived at the convention site last night and prepared for his farewell speech to the party tonight 
49dc030x The president leaves for California tomorrow and Bush will arrive to take control of the convention

49dc031c When the House and Senate approved the tax bill early Saturday lawmakers didn\'t mention the last minute provisions and congressional staffers described them as technical 
49dc031d While the estimated revenue of almost one hundred million dollars over three years is relatively small the provisions might be perceived as an anti takeover push by Congress 
49dc031e They could have the effect of slowing certain takeover activity congressional sources acknowledged over the weekend 
49dc031f To be sure on a lot of scores the summit was a success 
49dc031g Economic cooperation was [<door_slam] advanced with businessmen signing agreements for about thirty contracts and several joint ventures

49dc0409 U\. S\. bank regulations are another stumbling block 
49dc040a Currently banks can\'t own more than nineteen \.POINT nine \%PERCENT of a non financial company and can only be passive investors 
49dc040b Unless these restrictions are dropped banks are likely to be swapping mainly for equity in financial institutions

49dc040d Mexico nationalized its banks five years ago

49dc040n A spokesman for Burmah said that the proposal made yesterday was final and that Burmah and S\. H\. V\. wouldn\'t contemplate a hostile offer 
49dc040o He also ruled out the possibility that Burmah might launch a bid on its own 
49dc040p Ivan Toms isn\'t in a festive mood as he contemplates his impending confrontation with the military 
49dc040q I know it will be horrific he says staring down at his lunch but it is important to take this stand 
49dc040r I think individuals can make a difference 
49dc040s The budget however will not manage itself 
49dc040t Some way must be found to put it on course 
49dc040u In our history an impasse over policy has been broken occasionally by some sort of national commission and it is time for one again 
49dc040v Such a commission resolved the Social Security problem earlier in this decade 
49dc040w In the Johnson years a commission\'s proposals were the means for restructuring the budget 
49dc040x Still earlier it was a commission that recommended the creation of the Federal Reserve System 
49dc040y This approach enables the president and members of Congress to avoid some flak by merely implementing what the commission told us to do 
49dc040z Thus the board said it would be reluctant to give Bank of New York more than one extension of the initial ninety days to consummate the merger 
49dc0410 Normally extensions of the ninety day rule are granted freely 
49dc0411 But in the pending merger the board wants to avoid a long and fruitless struggle said Michael Bradfield the Fed\'s general counsel 
49dc0412 One of the more direct readings on inflation will come in Friday\'s report on consumer prices which are expected not surprisingly to be higher 
49dc0413 Analysts expect an increase of about \.POINT four \%PERCENT in the April consumer [cross_talk/] price index on the heels of a \.POINT five \%PERCENT jump the previous month [/cross_talk] 
49dc0414 The price increases are expected pretty much across the board as commodities and services are rising at about a four \%PERCENT annual rate 
49dc0415 But there is always the risk that reviving a classic slogan or spokesman will backfire and create an old fashioned image for a brand 
49dc0416 To guard against that marketers tend to give their recycled ads a contemporary twist 
49dc0417 [door_slam] The Captain Raid of nineteen eighty eight for example has rippling muscles and a futuristic look 
49dc0418 And a woman in one of the new Nestea spots doesn\'t just tumble [door_slam] into a swimming pool she falls onto an exercise mat that turns into a pool 
49dc0419 [door_slam] Prices at the mass retail level however haven\'t risen much in a decade partly because big retailers use tennis balls to lure shoppers 
49dc041a I remember purchasing a can of balls for two dollars in nineteen sixty seven says Walter L\. Henry a Pittsburgh recreational player 
49dc041b Two weeks ago I picked up a can for a dollar and eighty nine 
49dc041c Reacting to a wave of labor unrest the Communist government announced the special August thirty first session would review economic policies and perhaps adjust national price and income policies 
49dc041d The interior minister said at least twenty strikes have broken out and authorities extended a curfew and detained forty nine people nationwide 
49dc041e Some workers ended strikes yesterday but others prepared for assaults by troops and riot police 
49ec0201 A smaller market share still means substantial growth when the asset pool is vastly expanded notes George Collins president of T\. Rowe Price 
49ec0202 Nonetheless the firm has been paying more attention to the consumer aspects of the business 
49ec0203 Retail clients currently account for about fifty seven \%PERCENT of the total twenty two billion of assets under management at T\. Rowe Price 
49ec0204 In nineteen seventy eight retail business accounted for about thirty five \%PERCENT of the firm\'s assets 
49ec0205 Already arbitragers estimate industrywide losses in the takeover stock sell off that followed the Boesky news at between one billion dollars and two billion dollars 
49ec0206 Some say a few of their colleagues lost the entire year\'s profit in a week after the Boesky announcement November fourteenth 
49ec0207 Others watched glumly as their annual bonuses withered along with prices of takeover stocks 
49ec0208 London\'s one hundred share index fell eight \.POINT six points to close at twenty two seventy five its low for the day 
49ec0209 The Financial Times thirty share index was thirteen \.POINT three points lower at seventeen seventy five \.POINT two 
49ec020a The gold mines index fell thirteen \.POINT two to four hundred and fifty four \.POINT two 
49ec020b Volume was four hundred eighty seven \.POINT six million shares compared with three hundred ninety four \.POINT seven million Monday 
49ec020c Frankfurt shares tumbled in response to the weaker dollar and the decline on Wall Street Wednesday brokers said 
49ec020d Many blue chip issues lost as much as two \%PERCENT with a few dropping as much as four \%PERCENT 
49ec020e Financial shares were hit hardest among fears of higher interest rates 
49ec020f Inevitably some will seek a fourth alternative to continue borrowing from the rest of the world making only marginal adjustments in our economic policies 
49ec020g Earlier this century the British taught us that debt and leadership cannot long co exist 
49ec020h Eventually and the markets seem to be saying sooner rather than later we will have to choose 
49ec020i We saw it with oil and we\'re seeing it with gold says John Dessauer an Orleans Massachusetts money manager 
49ec020j When the price gets high enough all these new reserves open up eventually knocking down prices he says 
49ec020k He adds that he expects gold will soon retreat to below four hundred dollars 
49ec020l Articles began appearing about the rise of the religious right a group that seemed to be dealt with more as anthropology than journalism 
49ec020m After watching evangelical T\. V\. ministers Norman Lear began spending his fortune on a group called People for the American Way 
49ec020n Much of this swamp creature treatment came to a head in the nineteen eighty six lawsuits over creationism and secular humanism in school texts 
49ec020o The establishment made virtually no effort to push below the surface of these grievances 
49ec020p Bids totaling four hundred and sixty million dollars were submitted 
49ec020q Accepted bids ranged from six \.POINT six one eight \%PERCENT to six \.POINT six three \%PERCENT 
49ec020r Citicorp slated another fifty million dollar sale next Tuesday 
49ec020s NATO leaders ended a two day summit in Brussels 
49ec020t The alliance issued a *communique* that stressed its determination to decide on a comprehensive approach to further arms control treaties 
49ec020u But it sidestepped decisions on divisive issues such as modernizing the short range nuclear weapons based in West Germany 
49ec020v Unfair or not the questions are being asked about both the revolution\'s route and its goals How much violence will there be 
49ec020w Will whites have political rights 
49ec020x How many whites will lose their jobs 
49ec020y How Communist is the A\. N\. C\. 
49ec020z How much will the government control the economy 
49ec0210 In January signs of a weakening economy prompted Chairman Greenspan and Vice Chairman Johnson to push through a slight easing of policy allowing interest rates to fall 
49ec0211 Governor Angell worried by the strong commodity prices was reluctant to go along 
49ec0212 And several district bank presidents later bristled because they weren\'t consulted 
49ec0213 The rehabilitation process is certainly farther along 
49ec0214 There\'s less looking back and more looking forward now Mr\. LeFevre said 
49ec0215 People are focusing more on the election and the post election period what it might mean for the economy 
49ec0216 Analysts and franchisees alike pointed to what they regarded as an about face on Burger King by Pillsbury\'s new chairman and chief executive officer Philip L\. Smith 
49ec0217 In his maiden speech to Pillsbury shareholders on September thirteenth Mr\. Smith said reviving the chain was his top priority 
49ec0218 He called it one of Pillsbury\'s best opportunites for growth 
49ec0219 Moreover fiercely competitive organizations often shy away from courtroom confrontations over business tactics because of questions of image 
49ec021a The macho mentality of many corporate board rooms disdains defamation suits because they make a company look whiny says Mr\. Hanson 
49ec021b Most companies he says are afraid to look as if they can\'t take the competition 
49ec021c An Upjohn spokeswoman said the company planned to market Rogaine to women all along 
49ec021d However F\. D\. A\. approval for using the drug on men came first because Upjohn didn\'t test the product on enough women initially 
49ec021e Upjohn said it began testing Rogaine on women in nineteen eighty seven about four years after tests on balding men began 
49ec0301 Like their economies the currencies of the U\. S\. and Canada are closely related 
49ec0302 But as the interest rates rise in Canada the Canadian dollar is gaining on its U\. S\. counterpart traders and analysts say 
49ec0303 And as the Canadian unit rises it lures more from foreign investment particularly from Japan which adds to its strength 
49ec0304 The Treasury rules however contain modifications of the S\. E\. C\. rules designed to improve the protection of parties involved in repurchase agreements 
49ec0305 In such agreements called repos one party sells government securities to another with the understanding that the seller will repurchase them later at a specified price 
49ec0306 The proposed modifications would apply to government securities brokers or dealers that are already registered as well as to newly registered entities 
49ec0307 Nevertheless interest rates fell on short term Treasury bills sold yesterday at the government\'s weekly auction 
49ec0308 The average rate on new thirteen week bills declined to five \.POINT five nine \%PERCENT from five \.POINT eight one \%PERCENT at last week\'s sale 
49ec0309 The average rate on new twenty six week bills fell from five \.POINT nine nine \%PERCENT to six \.POINT one \%PERCENT the previous week 
49ec030a We are aware of our international obligations and we willingly accept them the banker observes 
49ec030b But the Bundesbank he asserts has to be very cautious in setting its monetary policy 
49ec030c From our point of view we already have a permissive policy he says 
49ec030d Doug is much more aggressive in the marketplace says James E\. Sorenson Battelle\'s senior vice president for manufacturing 
49ec030e He gets out and has one on one meetings with chief executives of companies and learns where the market is going 
49ec030f Battelle must anticipate commercial demand five to eight years ahead Mr\. Sorenson adds 
49ec030g Prices on the upscale Acura division\'s base model cars jumped even higher than the Honda division\'s prices 
49ec030h The Acura Integra jumped three \.POINT five \%PERCENT or three hundred and seventy dollars to ten thousand nine hundred and fifteen dollars 
49ec030i The luxury Legend sedan increased in price two \.POINT five \%PERCENT or five hundred and twenty five dollars to twenty three thousand six hundred seventy five dollars

49ec030k Foul weather was also blamed by a spokesman for Pan Am the first place finisher in December 
49ec030l Weather particularly affected flights in the Northeast and Europe where most of Pan Am\'s routes are located he said 
49ec030m He added that Pan Am nonetheless turned in one of the best performances among major carriers 
49ec030n He predicted the next report will show a rebound for the airline in February 
49ec030o To be sure a few companies are trying to use the Olympics to make the transition from a subcontractor to an internationally known brand 
49ec030p Kukje Corporation shifted f- from producing Nike shoes to developing its own Pro Specs line of athletic shoes five years ago 
49ec030q It paid four \.POINT five million dollars in cash and goods to be an official sponsor of the games and has been highlighting the logo in its advertising 
49ec030r Kukje hopes the Olympics will give Pro Specs a foothold in Europe 
49ec030s Viewers and critics say the huge load of ads and airtime is part of the problem 
49ec030t Commercial clutter seems greater than in previous Olympics broadcasts many critics say 
49ec030u The coverage between ads some complain is fragmented and shifty jumping too quickly among myriad sports 
49ec030v Actual events as opposed to taped profiles previews and reports take up less than half of the airtime 
49ec030w Many headline events don\'t appear until after midnight 
49ec030x The study was part of Cornell\'s response to calls by local politicians that it should help more in Tompkins County 
49ec030y When the schools were ranked by operating budget or value of buildings Cornell\'s one \.POINT two million dollar payments were found to be near the bottom of the list 
49ec030z In per student payments Cornell ranked seventh at seventy dollars 
49ec0310 Mr\. Delchamps said thirty \%PERCENT of the company\'s stock outstanding is held by people who have agreed not to sell their holdings before October thirty first 
49ec0311 Another twenty five \%PERCENT is held under the company\'s employee stock ownership plan 
49ec0312 Most of the people in the former category are expected to extend the no sell agreement for another year he said 
49ec0313 The lower volatility could be especially important right now when the course of interest rates [uh] seems especially cloudy 
49ec0314 While interest rates have been declining recently many economists expect rates to rise by year end 
49ec0315 After that however they say rates could fall again perhaps sharply as economic growth slows in nineteen eighty nine 
49ec0316 Jackson Democrats see Mr\. Jackson as an activist strong leader who is more willing to take risks than those in the often blander congressional wing of the party 
49ec0317 He clearly commands the Democrats\' most loyal constituency 
49ec0318 It is never wise to ignore those you can depend on says Sonia Jarvis of the National Coalition on Black Voter Participation 
49ec0319 In April Drexel agreed to pay six hundred and fifty million dollars and plead guilty to six felony counts related to a federal insider trading investigation 
49ec031a The plea agreement was made in conjunction with a broad settlement of securities law violations with the Securities and Exchange Commission 
49ec031b Because the firm agreed that it committed felonies securities commissioners in most states can automatically revoke Drexel\'s license to do business 
49ec031c Why this incredible diversion of effort to crimes that are often not clearly defined by statute and where identifiable victims are seldom found 
49ec031d Maybe too many of today\'s prosecutors were influenced by the prevailing counterculture suspicions of middle class morality during their law school days 
49ec031e But another answer is simpler It is easier to extract plea bargains from traders with a mere mention of R\. I\. C\. O\. than from real felons 
49ec0401 As a longtime member of the Anaheim California 
49ec0402 Redevelopment Commission the retired food company executive took pride in helping his city grow

49ec0405 B\. P\.\'s partially paid American depositary shares closed unchanged at seventeen and a quarter with thirteen \.POINT two million traded 
49ec0406 It was the Big Board\'s most active issue 
49ec0407 During the past several days corporations and other big investors have refrained from lending Treasury bonds and notes to securities dealers for brief periods 
49ec0408 That in turn has forced many dealers to refrain from selling borrowed securities or amassing so called short positions 
49ec0409 It\'s hard to short anything in this market at the moment said a trader at a large government securities dealer 
49ec040a Most analysts said the international operations of the two banks make a good fit 
49ec040b Generale de Banque has a strong network in Africa while Amro has more operations in the Middle East and Far East 
49ec040c And while Generale de Banque has an important commercial banking operation Amro has more experience in brokerage and investment services for its clients

49ec040m Mr\. Viet has bigger worries 
49ec040n Apart from uncooperative targets the paper and its thirty two journalists face a challenge to become more professional he says 
49ec040o Criticizing shortcomings isn\'t enough 
49ec040p We have to recognize achievements 
49ec040q We have to develop judgment and that isn\'t easy

49ec0411 Benetton denies all charges on the specific accusations by unhappy store owners and steadfastly maintains that it isn\'t a franchise operation and thus isn\'t subject to franchise requirements 
49ec0412 Store owners it says are licensees because they own their stores and don\'t pay royalties to Benetton as franchisees typically do 
49ec0413 Although it acknowledges that a few store owners have complained it blames any problems on the owners themselves or on its field representatives who deal directly with them 
49ec0414 Despite the problem with the Claridge Mr\. Wynn didn\'t rule out an eventual return to the Atlantic City gambling scene

49ec0418 He says sales at home related stores are growing ninety one \%PERCENT faster than at department stores and seventy five \%PERCENT faster than at apparel stores 
49ec0419 The trend is making the market less dependent on housing market cycles says Curt Steidtmann chief economist of Management Horizons Dublin Ohio 
49ec041a While second quarter housing starts were down thirty \%PERCENT from two years ago furniture sales were up eighteen \%PERCENT he says 
49ec041b These mixed feelings of frustration with and gratitude toward the authorities are part of the everyday life of a foreigner doing business in Korea 
49ec041c In fact such contradictions are what seem to make the Korean world go round

49fc0204 Mr\. Shlenker couldn\'t be reached 
49fc0205 Because of that some Wall Street professionals think the stock looks rather expensive 
49fc0206 It has tripled since nineteen eighty five largely on takeover speculation 
49fc0207 It currently trades at about nine times cash flow says Alan Gaines of Gaines Berland an institutional brokerage firm 
49fc0208 That\'s about a thirty \%PERCENT premium to quality oil companies like Royal Dutch Petroleum Exxon and Mobil he says 
49fc0209 [tongue_click] To these ends K\. P\. C\. enjoys a huge economic advantage 
49fc020a It costs Kuwait about a dollar to pump a barrel of oil and another fifty cents to bring it to Europe 
49fc020b The production cost of North Sea oil by contrast runs between eight dollars and thirteen dollars a barrel 
49fc020c The big difference disturbs European oil men 
49fc020d [tongue_click] The question was what form this conflict would take 
49fc020e The Civil War was finally fought over maintaining the Union 
49fc020f But what if there had been no Union 
49fc020g What if the South had been a separate nation 
49fc020h Would Southerners black or white have ever achieved full equality if they had been incorporated into the union as a conquered province 
49fc020i Or what if the war had been avoided and slavery just drifted on and on 
49fc020j Would the South have become another South Africa 
49fc020k I wouldn\'t bet against it [door_slam] 
49fc020l It still isn\'t clear what form the increases will take or when they will go into effect 
49fc020m Some carriers said they plan to raise fares Sunday and others said they will act a week later

49fc020s They need only listen to the group of eight women gathered here for a discussion of what they like and what they don\'t about the latest trends in fashion retailing

49fc0215 [lip_smack] Prices gradually moved higher through midafternoon when the market peaked and then started its retreat 
49fc0216 Philip Puccio manager of institutional *trading* at Dillon Read and Company said some institutions used the advance as an opportunity to do some selling 
49fc0217 They\'ve been peeling off some stock to take advantage of better prices he said 
49fc0218 [tongue_click] [door_slam] During the spring and summer the Fed nudged up short term interest rates to restrain the economy 
49fc0219 But worried as always about becoming a political football the Fed tried to keep a low profile in the weeks before the election 
49fc021a That strategy was helped by an apparent slowdown in economic growth in the third quarter which eased inflation worries and allowed the Fed to stop pushing up rates 
49fc021b [tongue_click] In the year earlier quarter the La Jolla California industrial and investment concern had a restated loss of fifty seven million dollars 
49fc021c The results were restated to reflect discontinued operations and the consolidation of its Signal Landmark Holdings Incorporated unit a real estate developer

49fc0307 Some have characterized our countermeasures as protectionist brought about because of congressional pressures 
49fc0308 That is dead wrong 
49fc0309 We have been in consultations with Japan on this issue since November long before present trade legislation was introduced 
49fc030a The president\'s action was the culmination of that process and it had nothing whatsoever to do with trade bills 
49fc030b President Reagan believes that people and nations should honor their obligations 
49fc030c There is nothing protectionist about that 
49fc030d Such cost cutting efforts have worsened labor disputes which have in turn pitted non union pilots against pro union pilots 
49fc030e First Officer Guy Casey was once a captain at Continental but lost his seniority during the bitter strike there in nineteen eighty three which he had helped to organize 
49fc030f He says he wants to put the experience behind him 
49fc030g Analysts also said they hadn\'t expected lower operating profits for the company\'s Industries Group and for the broadcasting segment 
49fc030h Westinghouse officials told analysts that operating profit in the Industries Group fell fifteen \%PERCENT to twenty \%PERCENT hurt in part by weak results in Canadian operations 
49fc030i A sharp drop in operating profit from the Broadcasting Group\'s production company contributed to the slightly lower operating earnings overall for that segment 
49fc030j The spokesman also said the league\'s owners are committed to playing with their current replacement rosters for the rest of the season including the Super Bowl if necessary

49fc030s Mr\. Timbers says he\'s fairly ambivalent about the price of gold near term 
49fc030t He does see however higher inflation of five \%PERCENT or so in nineteen eighty nine up from four \%PERCENT this year 
49fc030u A gold option could be a nice alternative for fixed income investors should inflation fears arise Mr\. Timbers says 
49fc030v Some economists say inflationary pressures could continue to push up U\. S\. interest rates this year 
49fc030w [tongue_click] If so foreign central banks may see that as an opportunity to tighten and to address their own inflation worries despite U\. S\. concern 
49fc030x One fear says Irving Trust economist Robert McGee is that higher global rates will send the financial markets into a tailspin 
49fc030y A similar view is held by Greta E\. Marshall investment manager of the California Public Employees\' Retirement System which manages about forty four \.POINT four billion dollars 
49fc030z I still see no evidence that inflation is picking up substantially she says 
49fc0310 The economy doesn\'t look so strong that it will rekindle inflation so I would view any further drop in bond prices as a buying opportunity 
49fc0311 Alas they probably should have devoted a little more thought to Winnebago\'s past 
49fc0312 The company had a history of carnage at the top running through five different chief executives in the fourteen years before Messrs\. 
49fc0313 Gilbert and Berreth strolled into town 
49fc0314 In one of those shake ups Winnebago\'s chairman and founder John K\. Hanson sacked his own son 
49fc0315 [lip_smack] Here are price trends on the world\'s major stock markets as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective Geneva 
49fc0316 To make them directly comparable each index is based on the close of nineteen sixty nine equaling one hundred 
49fc0317 The percentage change is since year end 
49fc0318 [tongue_click] After nearly eight years of the Reagan presidency a kind of morning after mood prevails here 
49fc0319 There is a sense that Mr\. Reagan\'s successor hasn\'t any choice but to be a consolidation president 
49fc031a Given budget constraints and a re energized Congress some here believe a Bush administration may not be all that different from a Dukakis administration 
49fc031b Some of that cash has been used for bonus payments 
49fc031c Wages and bonuses rose nineteen \%PERCENT in the first half a rate that far outpaced economic growth and exerted upward pressure on prices 
49fc031d China\'s economy grew at an annual rate of five \.POINT seven \%PERCENT in the first six months roughly half the average annual rate in the past !decade 
49fc0401 Texas started evaluating potential S\. S\. C\. sites about four years ago and now has solid data on six locations says Dillard Hammett state energy adviser 
49fc0402 Four more communities have since asked to be included 
49fc0403 Considering the state\'s flat relatively earthquake free landscape Mr\. Hammett says ninety five \%PERCENT of Texas could have the site 
49fc0404 The banks sought to eliminate a mismatch between their assets predominantly held in non pound currencies and their capital kept in pounds 
49fc0405 When the pound was weak during the early nineteen eighties the value of Scandinavian Bank\'s capital fell steeply in proportion to its non dollar assets 
49fc0406 The banks that owned Scandinavian Bank had to inject about forty seven \.POINT seven million dollars of additional capital 
49fc0407 Also the strong rise in share prices in recent weeks appears to have discounted most of the good news likely in the budget another dealer said 
49fc0408 [tongue_click] It\'s going to take quite a lot to move it sharply ahead from this level he said 
49fc0409 The one hundred share index is up eighteen \.POINT six \%PERCENT this year 
49fc040a The book he says will be about Arvida and generally about companies snared in the takeover game 
49fc040b It will ask some pointed questions Is there value added in corporate mergers 
49fc040c Does productivity increase and what happens to the people involved 
49fc040d The premier said it would be better for Mr\. Ghafar to remain as his deputy 
49fc040e I have trust in him 
49fc040f I chose him didn\'t I 
49fc040g Doctor Mahathir said 
49fc040h [tongue_click] S\. D\. I\. perpetuates the illusion that more weapons equals more security 
49fc040i Our dependence upon violence to resolve conflict is a short run solution to a long term problem 
49fc040j In order to ensure our survival we must change the way we think about conflict 
49fc040k By spending billions of dollars on developing nonviolent means of resolving conflict we can build a world beyond war and a sustainable secure future for all people 
49fc040l [tongue_click] Steven M\. Kincaid president said Kincaid\'s board would review the announcement when it meets sometime in the next few weeks 
49fc040m He declined to comment further 
49fc040n He said he and his father J\. Wade Kincaid who is chairman own a total of about six \.POINT four \%PERCENT of the company\'s common 
49fc040o Art collectors and dealers heaved a sigh of relief last night 
49fc040p After high prices and frantic bidding at art auctions last spring about one in four works didn\'t sell at a contemporary art auction at Christie\'s 
49fc040q But at least the market didn\'t crash 
49fc040r [tongue_click] Gemfibrozil has long been known to increase H\. D\. L\. but until this report its effect on heart disease was unclear 
49fc040s [door_slam] Available in the U\. S\. since nineteen eighty two gemfibrozil gained only limited use 
49fc040t That is because gemfibrozil only moderately reduces L\. D\. L\. compared with other drugs 
49fc040u In export led electrical and computer makers Kyocera slipped ninety to five thousand and twenty 
49fc040v Matsushita Electric Industrial was unchanged at two thousand and seventy 
49fc040w N\. E\. C\. rose ten to nineteen hundred and ten 
49fc040x Sony rose twenty to forty nine hundred and fifty 
49fc040y [tongue_click] Certain elements of a national system were obvious and quickly made their way into use 
49fc040z The first was a composite tape that brought information from various market centers onto one ticker tape 
49fc0410 A composite quotation display system soon followed allowing customers and brokers to see quotes from all markets on a single screen 
49fc0411 And an Intermarket Trading System allowed orders coming to various exchange floors to flow from one exchange to another quickly easily and at no cost 
49fc0412 In my original squad I\'m the only one left unharmed 
49fc0413 In my platoon there\'s only thirteen of us 
49fc0414 It seems everyday another young guy eighteen to nineteen years old like myself is killed in action 
49fc0415 Israeli Defense Minister Rabin said he had met with Palestinians to search for ways to end violence in the occupied territories 
49fc0416 But Arabs involved in the talks during the past few days said Rabin had nothing to offer and that the six month old rebellion would continue 
49fc0417 [tongue_click] Israel\'s army said two hundred and seven Palestinians have been killed in the unrest 
49fc0418 Prudential Insurance Company of America which participated in the nineteen eighty five buy out holds about a thirty \%PERCENT stake in Foodmaker 
49fc0419 A Foodmaker spokesman declined yesterday to comment on any involvement Prudential may have in the latest buy out proposal 
49fc041a Certain Foodmaker executives also may buy stakes in F\. M\. Acquisition the company said 
49fc041b [tongue_click] In other developments corn and wheat prices were mostly higher in a rebound from Monday\'s session when corn set new life of contract lows 
49fc041c Many traders bought contracts to cover short or selling positions 
49fc041d [tongue_click] Analysts said technical factors also played a part as prices backed and filled the gaps left on price charts by Monday\'s steep drop 
49gc0201 Kidder Peabody founded four years earlier long has been a socially well connected and profitable investment bank 
49gc0202 But its power on Wall Street ebbed in recent years as it was overtaken by larger more aggressive firms 
49gc0203 Kidder officials have recently hoped that its link with General Electric and G\. E\.\'s large amount of capital would restore it to its earlier preeminence 
49gc0204 We had to scour the earth to achieve that settlement Mr\. Liebmann said 
49gc0205 But through it all Ralph was calm and rational 
49gc0206 He doesn\'t panic when things start to go wrong 
49gc0207 Pacific Telesis is the second regional Bell company seeking to participate in international long distance service 
49gc0208 New York based Nynex Corp\. is a member of another group that wants to lay transatlantic phone cable on the ocean floor 
49gc0209 Both companies serve large numbers of business and financial customers and see international transmission of data as a large growth market 
49gc020a By and large OPEC is prepared to sit it out said a large OPEC minister who asked not to be identified 
49gc020b There may be some weaker members among us but OPEC as a whole isn\'t overproducing 
49gc020c The problem is speculation by traders that verges on psychological warfare 
49gc020d We\'ve entered a period where economic forces are producing tremendous strains on business says Lawrence O\'Brien a tax lobbyist 
49gc020e As a result you can no longer come up with an effective consensus among business groups on important issues 
49gc020f Adds Mr\. Shapiro When business speaks with two voices it tends not to be heard 
49gc020g Dayton Hudson may get some things it didn\'t request from the Minnesota legislature 
49gc020h Some political leaders are discussing whether to amend the Dayton Hudson proposal to ban such controversial management takeover defenses as golden parachutes poison pills and greenmail payments 
49gc020i This should be a two way street said Michael Hatch commissioner of the Minnesota Commerce Department 
49gc020j Managements shouldn\'t be entrenched 
49gc020k An index of long term Treasury bonds compiled by Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc\. sank to its lowest level since June two 
49gc020l The index fell four \.POINT eight seven points to twelve sixty three \.POINT seventy 
49gc020m That was only slightly above its low for the day of twelve sixty two \.POINT sixty four 
49gc020n The high was twelve seventy four \.POINT two nine 
49gc020o And that figure doesn\'t include gambling revenue 
49gc020p Casinos are flush with high rollers when a big fight comes to town enabling them to raise minimum table bets sky high 
49gc020q In Atlantic City it took one hundred dollars to elbow into a Trump Plaza craps game the night of the Michael Spinks Gerry Cooney heavyweight fight in June 
49gc020r Many blackjack tables had a minimum bet of five hundred dollars 
49gc020s The result The amounts wagered that Monday night exceeded seven million dollars up from about one \.POINT five million dollars for an average Monday 
49gc020t That same organization has remained in place ever since 
49gc020u Bush Brigade units hold annual meetings 
49gc020v They have their own newsletter 
49gc020w It has become a kind of private club which Dole supporters say is basically elitist 
49gc020x Portugal\'s prime minister said his nation wants to review a nineteen eighty three defense pact but isn\'t seeking a cut in U\. S\. military forces in the country 
49gc020y Cavaco Silva who met at the White House with Reagan urged increased aid 
49gc020z But Reagan said all nations hosting American military bases must share the pain from U\. S\. budget cuts 
49gc0210 The order carried out the ship takes off at flank speed from the Barents headed south to avoid detection 
49gc0211 Then inexplicably a few hours later all communication vanishes 
49gc0212 None with Washington none with other ships no signals from the usual commercial stations anywhere in the world 
49gc0213 Moreover Mr\. Fair\'s predictions tend to improve with age 
49gc0214 Back in nineteen seventy six he was giving President Ford the incumbent\'s four point advantage 
49gc0215 After the election he took it away 
49gc0216 Unlike Lyndon Johnson Mr\. Ford wasn\'t ever elected vice president Mr\. Fair explains feebly 
49gc0217 When Mr\. Fair presents the results of his equation today it still shows a Ford victory but by a less embarrassing margin 
49gc0218 Such plans make educators cringe 
49gc0219 They worry that a college degree could be reduced to a few trips to the notes department 
49gc021a My guess is that it will quickly become widespread because of peer pressure laments Randy Knight vice chairman for undergraduate studies in Ohio State\'s physics department 
49gc021b Standard and Poor\'s Corp\. put this personnel services concern\'s seventy four \.POINT eight million dollars of B\. plus rated convertible subordinated debt on CreditWatch with negative implications 
49gc021c The move follows the disclosure last week that investment banker Gibbons Green van Amerongen Limited plans a two step acquisition of a substantial stake in Robert Half 
49gc021d A Robert Half official said the company is convinced that our debt coverage will be strong and we don\'t think the risks will be unreasonable 
49gc021e Now his laughter is gone 
49gc021f Because of drugs he is dead 
49gc021g And every day my heart breaks a little more 
49gc0301 Sources close to Goldman Sachs said that federal marshals had roped off the firm\'s takeover trading area and were carting off documents yesterday afternoon 
49gc0302 They added that Mr\. Freeman hadn\'t been subpoenaed and that the firm hadn\'t had any warning that any government action was imminent 
49gc0303 Everyone is in total shock said one employee 
49gc0304 But while nickel and especially copper quotes have since rebounded aluminum prices have continued to tumble 
49gc0305 It seems to be in people\'s interest to keep the price down right now says one London exchange trader 
49gc0306 This will ultimately give them more buying opportunities down the line 
49gc0307 The nineteen seventy two A\. B\. M\. treaty requires a review every five years 
49gc0308 Communiques announcing completion of the first and second reviews were issued on November four nineteen seventy seven and November nine nineteen eighty two 
49gc0309 The third review was due by October three nineteen eighty seven 
49gc030a The most optimistic estimates are now that it will start sometime after the first of the year 
49gc030b The Reagan administration in short is conspiring with the Soviets to violate the review provisions of the treaty 
49gc030c No one seems quite sure how the publisher juggles his assets among his various companies which include the publicly owned Maxwell Communication Corp\. and various private ones 
49gc030d Control of the public company and of private interests like Mirror Group Newspapers Limited rests with a foundation in Liechtenstein . Pergamon Holding Foundation about which little is disclosed 
49gc030e He says its beneficiaries are charities which he promises to identify someday soon 
49gc030f The optimism is widespread 
49gc030g The association said fifty seven \%PERCENT predicted nineteen eighty eight will be better than nineteen eighty seven while only thirteen \%PERCENT expected a worse year 
49gc030h That is the highest total to forecast a better future year in December since nineteen eighty three when eighty six \%PERCENT were expecting stronger growth 
49gc030i President Reagan who was in Durham North Carolina was cautious about the Soviet offer 
49gc030j I\'m waiting to see what the conditions are he said 
49gc030k A senior administration official however called the Gorbachev statement a !watershed event because it will increase expectations among Soviet people for withdrawal 
49gc030l Regardless of how the foreign purchases begin they often involve the very parts that make weapons perform 
49gc030m For example F\. M\. C\. Corp\.\'s Bradley Fighting Vehicle depends on a sophisticated sensor system from the Netherlands to inform soldiers of potential threats and targets 
49gc030n Without this part tucked into the turret of the armored vehicle the Bradley would be comparatively helpless on the battlefield 
49gc030o Mr\. Iacocca said that while the pricing actions increased sales they also squeezed Chrysler\'s profit margins 
49gc030p But he added that the Number three U\. S\. auto maker made a conscious decision to sacrifice profit for a higher market share 
49gc030q That move is behind Chrysler\'s recent decisions to increase production which in turn will boost profit for the rest of the year 
49gc030r The Cuomo plan doesn\'t stop at gouging New York taxpayers and Long Island ratepayers 
49gc030s Federal taxpayers will also contribute 
49gc030t The key to the deal is that Lilco also would get a two \.POINT five billion dollar tax write off for Shoreham 
49gc030u This would guarantee that the utility won\'t have to pay any federal taxes for at least a decade 
49gc030v New York also would help Lilco float one hundred million dollars in tax exempt industrial development bonds to help pay for the cleanup 
49gc030w Make that de industrialization bonds 
49gc030x But network officials will spend months debating C\. B\. S\.\'s wisdom 
49gc030y It\'s time to be aggressive said Mr\. Pilson testily taking on reporters at yesterday\'s press conference 
49gc030z I\'m up here stating that C\. B\. S\. has acquired the rights and N\. B\. C\. hasn\'t 
49gc0310 At N\. B\. C\. Mr\. Watson was philosophic if pragmatic . You always want to be a winner he said 
49gc0311 But you don\'t want to commit suicide at the same time 
49gc0312 The total cut would correspond to the amount of coffee sold and not exceed eighteen thousand bags 
49gc0313 One bag equals sixty kilos 
49gc0314 The annual global export quota is fifty four \.POINT five million bags 
49gc0315 In another trade dispute Kansai International Airport Corp\. has come under attack 
49gc0316 Japan insists the company which is in charge of a new airport at Osaka is private and not subject to ministry orders 
49gc0317 Foreigners say that it is a semantic argument because nearly four fifths of the company\'s executives hail from government ministries 
49gc0318 Three years ago when the Moslem League came into the shared power arrangement Mr\. Ijaz Ali got into the provincial assembly 
49gc0319 There he wrung thousands of rupees from the government to build roads schools and electrification systems in his district 
49gc031a The government\'s idea was to outflank the P\. P\. P\. opposition through public works 
49gc031b Directly and indirectly the army plays an incalculable role in keeping Pakistan\'s distorted economy perking 
49gc031c Mr\. Jones the author notes that five hundred thousand Pakistani households four \%PERCENT of the economically active ones have sent young men into the army 
49gc031d Add in the households involved in services for the military and nearly ten \%PERCENT of the nation\'s households are involved 
49gc031e U\. S\. intelligence about the terrorists is considered poor 
49gc031f It has proven difficult to infiltrate small terrorist cells which often are held together by family relationships 
49gc031g And during the nineteen eighties Lebanese terrorists killed two of the Central Intelligence Agency\'s top Middle East operatives Robert Ames and William Buckley 
49gc0401 As modest as the measures are even they won\'t be adopted without a struggle 
49gc0402 The tax cuts accepted by the coalition parties have been linked to cutbacks in federal subsidies 
49gc0403 Such reductions could rile special interest groups and undermine parliamentary support for the entire tax program 
49gc0404 Moreover any tax reform must clear parliament\'s upper house the Bundesrat where the ruling Christian Democratic Union clings to a majority 
49gc0405 [loud_breath] Some banks have already turned certain debts into securities which so far they have held rather than selling 
49gc0406 To get around Japanese government limits on debt reserves a group of Japanese banks turned some Third World debt into preferred stock earlier this year 
49gc0407 And Shearson is about to start marketing a mutual fund to banks that would allow the banks to swap Philippine debt for equity investments in that country 
49gc0408 The Japanese stock market is awash with liquidity Mr\. Grant says 
49gc0409 But in June suddenly with no apparent drainage it went down and kept going down he says 
49gc040a What is a mystery to Mr\. Grant and many others is that the Tokyo market has since staged a vigorous rebound 
49gc040b The Philip Morris magazine enjoys by far the highest circulation of any company magazine seven \.POINT two million copies 
49gc040c The only requirement is that you have an adult to receive the magazine says Mary Taylor associate publisher 
49gc040d That\'s not because of racy articles but because the tobacco industry has been accused of trying to snatch twelve and thirteen year olds 
49gc040e Philip Morris is even considering selling space to outside advertisers it already ran an ad for Time magazine on a test basis in its winter nineteen eighty seven issue 
49gc040f Non U\. S\. borrowers also reportedly may come to market 
49gc040g The Republic of Austria may launch a long dated Euroyen issue perhaps totaling eighty billion yen six hundred and twenty two million dollars 
49gc040h Japan Finance Corp\. for a Municipal Enterprises is expected to announce a seven year issue that may total two hundred million dollars early today 
49gc040i Mitsui and Company has a minority stake in a leveraged buy out fund that acquired control of Joseph Horne Company in late nineteen eighty six 
49gc040j A chart in an earlier edition incorrectly listed Mitsui its role and the date of the transaction 
49gc040k In addition the chart omitted several large recent Japanese acquisitions because of a production error 
49gc040l The United Nations whose garbage bill is forty two thousand dollars a month is served by National Carting Company which won the pickup rights eight years ago 
49gc040m Last December the U\. N\. didn\'t attempt to solicit bids 
49gc040n It simply extended its contract with National Carting 
49gc040o Soliciting bids in this particular industry is not the way to go a U\. N\. spokesman says implying that it is futile 
49gc040p A big part of the reason for wood\'s success is the new techniques developed over the past five years for wood panels with a steel core 
49gc040q Besides narrowing the price difference between wood and metal systems these techniques provided the precision needed in designing panel systems that must fit together 
49gc040r Almost all the major office furniture manufacturers have acquired the ability to make wood systems in recent years 
49gc040s Still there are ways around the no documents dilemma 
49gc040t Says Davis Dwyer [tongue_click] a Winthrop Group managing director My first stop is to go to the factory and say Who is the buff 
49gc040u There\'s always a buff 
49gc040v In one case he found an employee who had saved every copy of the company\'s in house magazine for twenty five years 
49gc040w The whole environment has changed he says 
49gc040x We have a lot more options than we did before 
49gc040y He\'s planning on spending seven million dollars on advertising and promotion this year compared with a couple of million dollars in the past 
49gc040z Condom sales for the entire industry were up twenty seven \%PERCENT for the twelve months ended in April 
49gc0410 Carter Wallace\'s share amounts to over fifty \%PERCENT of the total market 
49gc0411 One of the four businesses included in the lockup option granted to K\. K\. R\. is Macmillan\'s directory division which consists of Who\'s Who and National Register Publishing 
49gc0412 Thus it wasn\'t immediately clear why International Thomson might be looking at the operation even though it is included in the lockup option 
49gc0413 A spokesman for K\. K\. R\. also declined comment 
49gc0414 Last year after world stock prices crashed the market for domestic Japanese convertible bonds fell briefly 
49gc0415 By the start of this year convertible issues with a par value of more than four trillion yen were trading at below their issue price 
49gc0416 They quickly recovered though thanks to a boom in the stock market and the relatively relaxed rate of new convertible bond issues 
49gc0417 The U\. S\. has been asking Damascus for help but the results have been disappointing 
49gc0418 We\'re just a little bit exasperated says a senior U\. S\. official 
49gc0419 They aren\'t doing all they could do 
49gc041a Aviation insurance is under intense pressure 
49gc041b The global airline premiums have dropped to about four hundred million dollars from about one billion dollars in nineteen eighty seven 
49gc041c Meanwhile airline losses in nineteen eighty eight rose significantly from the previous year 
49hc0201 At this point competing developers were eyeing the project 
49hc0202 Under its ground lease with the city and state the partnership might be found in default on its contract enabling a competing developer to take over 
49hc0203 To stave off an attack Mr\. Harrison says Our position was that we were never in default on our lease 
49hc0204 We maintain that the bank stopped funding 
49hc0205 I\'m positive on the move to his new post Mr\. Rhines said 
49hc0206 I grew up in the semiconductor group 
49hc0207 Mr\. Rhines held a number of positions in the company\'s semiconductor operations before taking the data systems job in early nineteen eighty five 
49hc0208 The F\. C\. C\. rejected petitions from several parties maintaining that the stations should be sold to someone with closer ties to the Hispanic community than Hallmark 
49hc0209 Hallmark however has said it would continue these stations in the Spanish language format 
49hc020a The F\. C\. C\. said the concerns over future programming were irrelevant to the transfer 
49hc020b These are the realities of South Africa says Mr\. de Beer 
49hc020c His eyebrows arch once again 
49hc020d What do we do 
49hc020e Robert McClements Junior chairman and chief executive officer said Sun continues to seek an acquisition that will provide the right mix of assets 
49hc020f A spokesman for the company said Sun is looking for something large in the area of energy reserves 
49hc020g The spokesman said Sun has more than one billion dollars in capital that it has gained from spinoffs and divestitures of companies over the past several years 
49hc020h No final budget decisions have been made at the White House 
49hc020i Budget drafting is behind schedule and federal agencies won\'t even see O\. M\. B\. recommendations until late this week 
49hc020j But it\'s already clear that the administration has increased its emphasis on education 
49hc020k Dole strategists belatedly seem to be recognizing the urgency of the situation 
49hc020l They met yesterday in Washington to review their position 
49hc020m It surprised people in the campaign just how intense the reaction was to Dole\'s position says one of the senator\'s top campaign advisers 
49hc020n Who got her vote last September 
49hc020o Gen\. 
49hc020p Bussi she says 
49hc020q I think we need a hard hand 
49hc020r First Interstate\'s fourth quarter loss resulted from a previously announced one hundred and eighty million dollar addition to its reserves against possible foreign debt losses 
49hc020s But even without the reserves the company said earnings would have been flat at about eighty five million dollars compared with the year earlier quarter 
49hc020t First Interstate had a slight decline in earnings assets and negligible growth in net interest income 
49hc020u Non interest income fell seventeen \%PERCENT partly because year earlier results included a nineteen \.POINT six million dollar pretax gain on the sale of a building 
49hc020v Pillsbury\'s loss compares with earnings of forty eight \.POINT five million dollars or fifty six cents a share in the year earlier quarter 
49hc020w Revenue fell two \%PERCENT in the latest period to one \.POINT five billion dollars from one \.POINT five three billion dollars 
49hc020x The revenue decline came from Pillsbury\'s restaurant business 
49hc020y That\'s a business decision that the manager has to make Mr\. Keane says 
49hc020z It\'s going to affect his return 
49hc0210 And in the long run the return will decide whether the manager stays in his job 
49hc0211 For hundreds of years the Kurds have struggled to establish an independent Kurdistan in a territory that straddles parts of Turkey Iraq and Iran 
49hc0212 Like the Palestinians the world\'s twenty million Kurds share a religion a culture a language and a passion for autonomy 
49hc0213 Nearly half live in Turkey which refuses even to recognize them as a distinct national minority and refers to them only as mountain Turks 
49hc0214 Though the Kurds outnumber the Palestinians by a ratio of five to one the Kurdish cause has attracted little global attention 
49hc0215 [tongue_click] Mr\. Murray forty nine years old had been scheduled to assume the posts of chairman and chief executive on December thirty one 
49hc0216 He became president in January when Fleet Financial Group merged with Norstar Bancorp 
49hc0217 Fleet Norstar retains headquarters in Providence Rhode Island and in Albany 
49hc0218 One of the four businesses included in the lockup option granted to K\. K\. R\. is Macmillan\'s directory division which consists of Who\'s Who and National Register Publishing 
49hc0219 Thus it wasn\'t immediately clear why International Thomson might be looking at the operation even though it is included in the lockup option 
49hc021a A spokesman for K\. K\. R\. also declined comment 
49hc021b O\. T\. C\. brokers also stress that their stocks often outperform listed ones on a long term basis 
49hc021c And overall the Nasdaq Composite Index is up thirteen \%PERCENT this year twice as much as the Dow Jones Industrial Average 
49hc021d Also they note the tiny stocks that generally trade under three dollars a share have always taken big percentage moves up or down when they move at all 
49hc021e The most widely used estrogen product in the U\. S\. is sold under the brand name *Premarin* by American Home Products Corp\.\'s Wyeth Ayerst Laboratories 
49hc021f In nineteen eighty eight sales of *Premarin* largely to prevent osteoporosis jumped twenty six \%PERCENT to two hundred and thirty six million dollars 
49hc021g A spokeswoman for the company said *Premarin* isn\'t currently indicated for use in preventing heart disease but the company is researching the matter 
49hc0301 Immediately after the accident British Airways began checking its other jets for cracks [other_mouth_sound] 
49hc0302 It found cracks more than two inches long in thirty six engines all of which it removed from planes 
49hc0303 Even after spare engines were installed thirteen jets were grounded 
49hc0304 When the market was roaring it was stupid to have cash says the fund manager at a major Japanese trust bank 
49hc0305 But now it isn\'t so bad 
49hc0306 And Salomon\'s Mr\. Napier says Everyone is getting into cash right now and waiting 
49hc0307 Hours before the arguments begin lawyers and aides representing outside investors will begin circling 
49hc0308 They will stake out choice seats near the exit and plot escape routes to nearby telephones 
49hc0309 Once the hearing begins they will hang on the judge\'s every word 
49hc030a A French press report said the exports include sophisticated equipment for making semiconductors 
49hc030b It said the machinery may have helped the Soviets build advanced computer memories for such military purposes as missile guidance 
49hc030c Western nations have reached *agreements* intended to forbid exports of such equipment to the Soviets 
49hc030d Juan Caldera a sixty two year old agricultural worker from Ciudad Juarez Chihuahua is outside Freddy\'s at one a\. m\. looking for his employer 
49hc030e For his amnesty application Mr\. Caldera needs the boss\'s signature to help prove that he has worked in the fields for at least ninety days 
49hc030f Actually Mr\. Caldera has worked in the fields for almost thirty years 
49hc030g Among the big bashes that didn\'t survive was First Boston Corp\.\'s year end extravaganza which in nineteen eighty six entertained thirty five hundred 
49hc030h Rather than fund an encore the brokerage firm contributed to the New York Times Neediest Cases Fund and the Coalition for the Homeless in New York 
49hc030i Similarly at Goldman Sachs and Company the dining room staff did without its annual party and instead gave a lunch for a group of homeless children 
49hc030j When reminded of the role reversals Irving\'s Mr\. Rice says the fact that the merger talk never went further obviously shows there is no commonality 
49hc030k A spokesman for Mr\. Bacot says this A lot has happened in banking and the financial markets in the intervening years 
49hc030l The relevance of those comments to today\'s circumstances isn\'t very great 
49hc030m Mr\. Reagan vigorously defended Attorney General Edwin Meese who is under investigation for his role in advancing a Middle East oil pipeline advocated by one of Mr\. Meese\'s friends 
49hc030n Mr\. Reagan said he couldn\'t remember being told anything about the pipeline and expressed every confidence in Mr\. Meese\'s integrity 
49hc030o He also criticized the lynch mob atmosphere that has accompanied investigations of his aides 
49hc030p In the two selected areas the state will allow procurement and retail prices to rise to what the open market demands 
49hc030q The subsidy for consumers is meant to reduce the strain on urban residents 
49hc030r Farmers of course will get higher prices for their grain from the market which in turn should induce them to increase production 
49hc030s Grain production throughout China has faltered in recent years in part because state procurement prices were too low 
49hc030t Meanwhile share prices closed higher in Sydney Hong Kong Wellington Seoul and Manila and were lower in Singapore 
49hc030u Trading was described as light to moderate 
49hc030v The Taipei market was closed 
49hc030w Grains and soybeans The threat of rain and favorable spring planting conditions pushed soybean and corn futures prices lower 
49hc030x The latest weather forecast calls for fairly good moisture in Midwest farming states over the next six to ten days 
49hc030y Analysts said traders are shifting their emphasis away from last year\'s crop and to this year\'s 
49hc030z With this year\'s small acreage increases weather and spring planting conditions are major concerns to a market that is beginning to shake off a huge surplus 
49hc0310 The favorable conditions helped the soybean contract for November settlement close at six \.POINT eight two two five dollars a bushel down nine \.POINT five cents 
49hc0311 Another executive explains the problems as the opposite of nineteen eighty seven 
49hc0312 Last year you had tumultuous swings in the markets themselves he says 
49hc0313 This year the environment will be narrower swings but volume will be lower with revenues insufficient to cover costs 
49hc0314 More important than arithmetic however is Mr\. Jackson\'s message 
49hc0315 Speaking to black aspirations he represents the best of the American dream 
49hc0316 He might even qualify as a social conservative if not for his endorsement of homosexual rights 
49hc0317 On the first day of the general strike factories closed but bookstores remained open in this old world cultural center 
49hc0318 Most schools were shut but Pushkin Street near the square reverberated as usual with the sound of badly played Chopin emanating from the open windows of the music academy 
49hc0319 Many of the Armenian demands are cultural 
49hc031a They want their old flag reinstated their children sent to Armenian schools rather than Russian ones their own language used on official documents 
49hc031b Their political demands include calls for a separate army brigade and the right for Armenia to have consulates abroad 
49hc031c The study was part of Cornell\'s response to calls by local politicians that it should help more in Tompkins County 
49hc031d When the schools were ranked by operating budget or value of buildings Cornell\'s one \.POINT two million dollar payments were found to be near the bottom of the list 
49hc031e In per student payments Cornell ranked seventh at seventy dollars

49hc0402 Class B\. stock has one vote per share but Presidio has said it doesn\'t plan to pay dividends on those shares 
49hc0403 Presidio holders may exchange their Class B\. shares on a share for share basis through June thirtieth 
49hc0404 Here are price trends on the world\'s major stock markets as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective Geneva 
49hc0405 To make them c- directly comparable each index is based on the close of nineteen sixty nine equaling one hundred 
49hc0406 The percentage change is since year end 
49hc0407 Judge them on their personality judge them on anything you want the master of ceremonies tells the crowd 
49hc0408 This is serious stuff here says Tom Schreyer twenty four admiring one contestant 
49hc0409 She\'s got tattoos and everything 
49hc040a Still securities and banking regulators worry whether they are acting fast enough to safeguard against growing risks in the world\'s financial markets 
49hc040b Many agree there is little time to waste in the scramble to create better international regulation 
49hc040c As Mr\. Feldstein says You can\'t just look at the building and say it hasn\'t fallen down yet so we should be safe 
49hc040d With the initial financing complete L\. S\. I\. looked abroad in February nineteen eighty two for its next infusion 
49hc040e We decided to go to investors who\'d pay a higher price explains Mr\. Corrigan 
49hc040f At the time Europeans were clamoring to invest in U\. S\. high technology and had few opportunities to participate directly in good deals he says 
49hc040g If we look at the record the debate should be rather short 
49hc040h The winners obvious 
49hc040i The only tragedy and it\'s an amazing one is that most Americans don\'t even know what has been accomplished and how it came about 
49hc040j But inside Room seven thirteen the Japanese see the situation somewhat differently 
49hc040k They reason like this If the U\. S\. imposes sanctions they most likely will be aimed at Japanese construction companies doing business in the U\. S\. 
49hc040l But that would hurt thousands of American workers who are employed either directly or indirectly by such companies 
49hc040m The political fallout for the Reagan administration might be too great to risk that 
49hc040n Toronto based P\. C\. L\. makes packaging and furniture 
49hc040o Robert J\. Tweedy its president said the company is looking at its options but he declined to comment further 
49hc040p Mr\. Tweedy and Thomas N\. Davidson chairman own nineteen \%PERCENT of P\. C\. L\.\'s five \.POINT three million shares outstanding 
49hc040q Mr\. Tanaka was among the first scientists to recognize the potential of superconductors which are substances that can carry electricity with no resistance and thus no loss of power 
49hc040r If made practical they could bring spectacular changes to almost any electrical product or process 
49hc040s That could mean vastly faster and more energy efficient products such as computers cars and household appliances 
49hc040t But until the recent breakthrough superconductors had to be chilled to a hopelessly low temperature to work so except for a few applications there really was no technology 
49hc040u Mr\. Iacocca said that while the pricing actions increased sales they also squeezed Chrysler\'s profit margins 
49hc040v But he added that the Number three U\. S\. auto maker made a conscious decision to sacrifice profit for a higher market share 
49hc040w That move is behind Chrysler\'s recent decisions to increase production which in turn will boost profit for the rest of the year 
49hc040x Critics argue that he may be overly optimistic though 
49hc040y And Mr\. Dukakis is certain to face more pressure on the question from Vice President Bush who supports both the M\. X\. and Midgetman 
49hc040z Moreover most of the members of Congress being considered as potential running mates for Governor Dukakis have backed one or the other missile plans 
49hc0410 The defense authorization bill pending in Congress is expected to put off any decision until a new administration takes office next year 
49hc0411 Still Mr\. Love thinks he has the worst behind him 
49hc0412 Permian has bottomed out he says but he\'s using Intergroup\'s investment bankers to sound out prospective buyers anyway 
49hc0413 To bolster the balance sheet he\'s also attempting to reach agreement later this year to sell to Japan\'s N\. K\. K\. the other half of its steel holdings 
49hc0414 F\. P\. L\. said the acquisition would be accounted for as a pooling of interests 
49hc0415 Turner owns about twelve thousand acres in southwest Florida ten thousand of which are citrus groves 
49hc0416 F\. P\. L\. said the acquisition increases its citrus acreage to twenty two thousand 
49hc0417 Basic engineering design and site preparation studies are to start this winter 
49hc0418 Construction is to start in nineteen ninety one provided the project remains economically attractive 
49hc0419 Production is to start in nineteen ninety six 
49hc041a Mr\. Taylor will remain president a post he has held since May one 
49hc041b He also has served since the beginning of the year as chief operating officer that position will be eliminated next Tuesday 
49hc041c Previously he was president of Cigna\'s property casualty group for five years and served as chief financial officer 
49ic0201 Bank aid . Oklahoma Senator Boren and other lawmakers from states hard hit by bank closings mull ways to ease the fallout 
49ic0202 A major concern is a drop in real estate values when extensive landholdings of failed banks are sold 
49ic0203 [tongue_click] One possible goal a regional consortium to help prop up land prices 
49ic0204 Virtually everybody in the business complains about too many awards and most big agencies try to enter only the five or ten most prestigious contests 
49ic0205 [tongue_click] Yet even the most vehement critics keep on competing 
49ic0206 If you don\'t it looks like you aren\'t good enough to win complains Roy Grace the chairman of the New York agency Grace and Rothschild 
49ic0207 You have to play the game 
49ic0208 Cleveland confronted scandals swiftly and with uncommon candor conceding from the outset for example his affair with Maria Halpin once it was exposed 
49ic0209 Yet he went to great lengths to conceal his cancer surgery 
49ic020a Mr\. Reagan on the other hand exposed his malignant bowels to the nation but only grudgingly took responsibility for the Iran contra fiasco 
49ic020b [tongue_click] Meanwhile the agency said it will conduct a study on its own 
49ic020c Officials said the review may lead to new regulations for data processing systems 
49ic020d [tongue_click] The agency may also challenge past charges to the Pentagon 
49ic020e Pentagon officials say the review likely will take at least a year 
49ic020f While other OPEC members recognize the advantage of going downstream . most lack Kuwait\'s money small population and ability to move fast 
49ic020g [tongue_click] We can\'t argue that strongly for spending billions abroad to buy downstream facilities says a Venezuelan oil official 
49ic020h Our people are still hungry and our domestic economy needs the money more 
49ic020i And that figure doesn\'t include gambling revenue 
49ic020j [tongue_click] Casinos are flush with high rollers when a big fight comes to town enabling them to raise minimum table bets sky high 
49ic020k In Atlantic City it took one hundred dollars to elbow into a Trump Plaza craps game the night of the Michael Spinks Gerry Cooney heavyweight fight in June 
49ic020l Many blackjack tables had a minimum bet of five hundred dollars 
49ic020m The result The amounts wagered that Monday night exceeded seven million dollars up from about one \.POINT five million dollars for an average Monday 
49ic020n The survey\'s composite index fell to fifty eight \.POINT nine \%PERCENT in November from October\'s sixty one \.POINT eight \%PERCENT 
49ic020o A figure above fifty \%PERCENT indicates that the economy is generally expanding 
49ic020p November marks the sixteenth consecutive month of expansion 
49ic020q Trading this week may indicate the market\'s direction with the Dow Jones industrials near the October nineteen low 
49ic020r Last week stock prices were sent tumbling by skittish investors many of whom are concerned with stagflation 
49ic020s Bond prices fell Friday 
49ic020t I think Mr\. 
49ic020u Tsai is probably torn between two goals building a world class financial company and making money personally says Martin Sosnoff of Atalanta Sosnoff Capital 
49ic020v While the goals aren\'t mutually exclusive he adds they may not always be attainable at the same time 
49ic020w [tongue_click] Britain\'s foreign secretary confirmed that British security forces killed three unarmed Irish Republican Army guerrillas Sunday in Gibraltar 
49ic020x [tongue_click] Sir Geoffrey Howe said a terrorist act has been averted 
49ic020y The three two men and a woman reportedly were planning a bomb attack on a military parade today in the British colony 
49ic020z This may turn out to be an extremely positive development because all of the tobacco manufacturers were involved in the alleged conspiracy Mr\. Daynard said 
49ic0210 There is a lot of damning evidence 
49ic0211 Now the jury can consider almost all the evidence that came in about defendants\' attempts to stonewall and deny 
49ic0212 The flippers apparently waited the two weeks then dumped their shares when trading opened in the stock 
49ic0213 The flippers in the industry were hungrier to do this than expected an executive close to the deal says 
49ic0214 They were able to borrow money 
49ic0215 Analysts say there is a strong chance that Kao will take advantage of an earlier U\. S\. acquisition 
49ic0216 Last year it bought High Point North Carolina based High Point Chemical Corporation for an undisclosed sum 
49ic0217 High Point produces raw materials for toiletries and personal care products 
49ic0218 I have never sought either willfully or otherwise to evade income tax Mr\. Seow said 
49ic0219 Mr\. Seow said in an interview yesterday that if convicted he could face a prison sentence 
49ic021a [tongue_click] He repeated his vow to stand for parliamentary elections expected later this year 
49ic021b Why not farmers respond 
49ic021c We haven\'t seen these prices before says David Gustafson an Eaton Colorado bean grower 
49ic021d [tongue_click] He still has half of last year\'s harvest in storage even though he will start harvesting this year\'s crop . this week 
49ic021e [tongue_click] I wanted to speculate he explains 
49ic0301 While all West German political parties agreed on the need for tax cuts of about twenty two billion dollars . they differ on who should benefit 
49ic0302 The Social Democrats and the left wing Greens want the cuts to help the poor and the working class 
49ic0303 Within the ruling coalition the liberal Free Democrats and the Bavarian sister party of the Christian Democrats the Christian Socialists want cuts spread across the board 
49ic0304 Mr\. Funaro described as hot air and nonsense foreign bankers\' language in their criticism of Brazil\'s lack of economic policy 
49ic0305 He said nobody worried about Brazil\'s high inflation when the country was producing big surpluses to meet debt payments 
49ic0306 Instead of looking for excuses he said these banks should realize there\'s a debt crisis and it has to be resolved by both sides 
49ic0307 Kidder Peabody was fined twenty five \.POINT three million dollars by the S\. E\. C\. to settle insider trading and other charges 
49ic0308 The penalty is second only to Ivan Boesky\'s one hundred million dollar fine last fall 
49ic0309 Kidder\'s settlement the first by a major firm in the insider trading scandal will allow the G\. E\. subsidiary to escape criminal prosecution 
49ic030a Even so Gloria has already given up hope 
49ic030b I hear that only people with money will be approved she says 
49ic030c My mother tells her it isn\'t true to be patient 
49ic030d The firm dollar also boosted prices in Zurich . and encouraged selective buying by foreign and domestic investors dealers said 
49ic030e [tongue_click] Some financial chemical and other industrial stocks had the biggest gains 
49ic030f Banks also ended mostly higher 
49ic030g Meanwhile Mr\. Silva Herzog borrowed a friend\'s unmarked office in central Mexico and discreetly received visitors 
49ic030h [tongue_click] He turned down job offers from companies and international lending agencies . but accepted lecturing engagements abroad 
49ic030i [tongue_click] He thought about opening a U\. S\. Latin America studies center in Mexico City or setting up a consulting firm 
49ic030j What happens now 
49ic030k [tongue_click] That depends on two things whether management can gain the trust of the workers and whether union leaders can control the rank and file 
49ic030l It doesn\'t look good on either count 
49ic030m Indeed labor experts say there is only a slim chance that South Korea can lay a foundation for labor relations that might calm worker unrest soon 
49ic030n [tongue_click] Turnout is another unknown factor 
49ic030o To capitalize here . Governor Dukakis would like to see a heavy turnout especially in such pockets of strength as the Chicago lakefront and suburbs 
49ic030p [tongue_click] But that may not happen Illinois registration is below nineteen eighty four and no presidential candidate has yet caught fire 
49ic030q In my original squad I\'m the only one left unharmed 
49ic030r In my platoon there\'s only thirteen of us 
49ic030s It seems everyday another young guy eighteen to nineteen years old like myself is killed in action 
49ic030t We seem to be ready to take a little rest said one participant 
49ic030u I don\'t think people are either screamingly worried or screamingly excited about this market said another 
49ic030v I think the attitude has got to be that we\'ve been outperforming the other world markets and now the other markets may be outperforming this one a little 
49ic030w July platinum rose ten dollars and thirty cents an ounce to five hundred and seventy seven dollars 
49ic030x July silver advanced eight \.POINT five cents an ounce to seven \.POINT one five five dollars 
49ic030y August gold gained one dollar and twenty cents an ounce to four hundred and fifty five dollars and eighty cents 
49ic030z All three metals traded higher at various points in the day but late profit taking trimmed the advances 
49ic0310 But Mr\. Parcher is also considered abrasive at times 
49ic0311 He rubs some people wrong says Leonard Marks who has tried cases against him 
49ic0312 He\'s very outspoken 
49ic0313 Lawrence Summers economic adviser to Governor Dukakis argues that even the best figures provide a discouraging picture of the economy 
49ic0314 [tongue_click] It used to be that standards of living rose reliably he says referring to the nineteen fifties and nineteen sixties 
49ic0315 But the pace in the nineteen eighties has been negative by my preferred measure and glacial by any other 
49ic0316 Still the neural network represents a remarkable conceptual leap in the computer world 
49ic0317 It is a critical building block in artificial intelligence much as the neurons in humans are the vehicle for brain function 
49ic0318 The network has allowed researchers to create the first convincing likeness of the brain in areas such as memory and vision 
49ic0319 [tongue_click] Despite the problems with the Claridge Mr\. Wynn didn\'t rule out an eventual return to: the Atlantic City gambling scene 
49ic031a [tongue_click] It\'s disappointing he said of the failed proposal 
49ic031b But this is a very lively market and we haven\'t given up yet 
49ic031c The Kremlin which long denied that there were political prisoners here now concedes they do exist 
49ic031d The most recent official Soviet estimates put the total between twelve and twenty nine 
49ic031e Moscow defines political prisoners as people sentenced under two articles of the Soviet criminal code that make behavior loosely defined as anti Soviet a criminal offense 
49ic031f Both articles of the code were widely used in locking up dissidents in the nineteen seventies 
49ic0401 Ad agencies in the past have typically received as commissions fifteen \%PERCENT of an advertiser\'s billings the total cost of placing ads 
49ic0402 The purchased units had nineteen eighty five billings of two hundred and seventy five million dollars 
49ic0403 [tongue_click] Ayer had nineteen eighty five billings of eight hundred and twenty six \.POINT four million dollars 
49ic0404 The Diet is a one house legislature apportioned by district rather than population like the Senate as opposed to the House 
49ic0405 This means that Japanese farmers have tremendous control over Japanese politics 
49ic0406 Food prices in Japan take forty \%PERCENT or more of the average person\'s wage 
49ic0407 With housing taking another forty \%PERCENT and the fact that the Japanese are great savers they are left with almost no discretionary income 
49ic0408 This is why they cannot develop a domestic market 
49ic0409 They don\'t have money to spend except a small amount of savings that they spend only on special occasions or for unusual bargains 
49ic040a Cray already has sold two of the new computers 
49ic040b All told Cray says it expects to sell four Y\. M\. P\.s this year and perhaps a dozen next year about as many as it can build 
49ic040c [tongue_click] The government\'s Los Alamos National Laboratory confirmed it is buying the first machines to add to what a spokesman described as the world\'s most powerful scientific computing network 
49ic040d The laboratory bought the first Cray in nineteen seventy six 
49ic040e In addition Batus is expected this morning to file for approval of a takeover with insurance regulators in nine Western states where Farmers operates 
49ic040f Approval by all is considered necessary for a successful takeover the company\'s Wall Street advisers have said 
49ic040g In its offer Batus signaled that the approval process may take months 
49ic040h In recent months the quota program itself has become increasingly controversial 
49ic040i Some big U\. S\. steelmakers which sell semifinished steel in the domestic marketplace are fighting to continue quotas after their scheduled expiration September thirtieth 
49ic040j Others though dependent on outside supplies of semifinished are pushing to end quotas 
49ic040k If the extradition effort fails the British government loses more than the chance to prosecute a key suspect 
49ic040l It also could lose access to an important source of evidence against other accused individuals 
49ic040m Five other prominent British businessmen including former Guinness Chairman Ernest Saunders have been arrested and charged as part of the government investigation 
49ic040n The Sunday afternoon audience of mostly adults watching Dominick and Eugene was remarkably quiet until one of the characters on screen picked up a gun 
49ic040o Oh no a man in the middle of the theater gasped breaking the silence 
49ic040p A few people giggled nervously you could tell they\'d been thinking the same thing themselves 
49ic040q Then more silence interrupted again later by a round of communal sobbing

49ic040v Frankfurt share prices retreated across the board in moderately active trading as the day earlier decline on Wall Street and weaker dollar prompted widespread profit taking 
49ic040w But equities recovered some of their earlier losses late in the session and most prices closed only slightly lower 
49ic040x The market\'s bullish momentum is still intact traders said citing a flurry of late buy orders 
49ic040y After yesterday\'s vote Mr\. Mulroney wouldn\'t say whether he would take any action against the other eight Tories who voted against the bill 
49ic040z Sounding philosophical he said It\'s a fact of life 
49ic0410 You try and get unanimity but you don\'t always succeed 
49ic0411 State pre emption was protested by Leslie Gainer a lobbyist for the U\. S\. Public Interest Group . which represents consumers 
49ic0412 It\'s a real slap in the face of state legislators she said 
49ic0413 She also complained that full disclosure isn\'t immediately required in credit card solicitations on the telephone or in magazines catalogs and flyers 
49ic0414 Yet she praised the bill for enhancing the disclosure made in most states 
49ic0415 Standard and Poor\'s Corporation put this personnel services concern\'s seventy four \.POINT eight million dollars of B\. plus rated convertible subordinated debt on CreditWatch with negative implications 
49ic0416 The move follows the disclosure last week that investment banker Gibbons Green van Amerongen Limited plans a two step acquisition of a substantial stake in Robert Half 
49ic0417 A Robert Half official said the company is convinced that our debt coverage will be strong and we don\'t think the risks will be unreasonable 
49ic0418 Mr\. Greenspan complied 
49ic0419 What happened there is very similar to what I gather is happening here he said 
49ic041a Just when the Social Security panel was about to give up the dam broke which led us to a rather surprising end 
49ic041b [tongue_click] An Upjohn spokeswoman said the company planned to market Rogaine to women all along 
49ic041c However F\. D\. A\. approval for using the drug on men came first because Upjohn didn\'t test the product on enough women initially

49jc0201 Britain is launching a nationwide AIDS warning campaign that urges the use of condoms for people who won\'t restrict their sexual partners 
49jc0202 Leaflets that are being delivered to twenty three million households warn that AIDS isn\'t limited to homosexuals 
49jc0203 Officials say television warnings will follow 
49jc0204 Even when complaints are filed they can be difficult to verify 
49jc0205 [tongue_click] Agencies generally don\'t use undercover testers posing as prospective tenants as they do in race discrimination complaints they fear that the tester could be attacked 
49jc0206 Instead they try to build cases on the testimony of current and former tenants 
49jc0207 [tongue_click] Had that happened the failed banks would have been turned over to the F\. D\. I\. C\. for disposition 
49jc0208 In most cases the agency sells the failed bank to another institution along with the good loans 
49jc0209 The F\. D\. I\. C\. purchases the bad loans and tries to salvage whatever it can 
49jc020a For investors the partnerships are only as attractive as the underlying buyouts 
49jc020b Many in the field contend that the buyouts being put together these days are generally overpriced because of several factors 
49jc020c Among them too much capital chasing too few good candidates which has pushed costs up and returns down to what they see as unacceptable levels 
49jc020d The review committee tries to offer a menu of small medium and large capitalization stocks 
49jc020e Some of its most successful picks were quite small companies when first recommended 
49jc020f Money managers minding billion dollar portfolios on the other hand often avoid smaller stocks because they can\'t purchase a significant stake without affecting the price 
49jc020g The dollar\'s slippage came despite more comments from Treasury Secretary James Baker aimed at supporting it 
49jc020h [tongue_click] In a television interview Mr\. Baker said the U\. S\. and its top six economic allies are prepared to act to stabilize the dollar around current levels 
49jc020i Last week the Treasury secretary warned in a speech that a continued decline in the U\. S\. currency\'s value could be counterproductive 
49jc020j Those creditors include multilateral agencies Latin American and some European governments and short term commercial bank creditors and suppliers

49jc020s He added that the paragraphs of the order that were upheld continue to prohibit Emulex from using trade secrets that Digital says were stolen from it 
49jc020t Mr\. Prendergast also admires Nomura\'s perseverance 
49jc020u [tongue_click] They\'ve been calling on us for about fifteen years and didn\'t generate any business for the first ten he says 
49jc020v Their persistence and the wealth of Japan and the flows of capital from Japan have paid off for them 
49jc020w People thought we\'d sit back and just enjoy the holidays said Edward P\. *Nicoski* market strategist at Piper Jaffray and Hopwood Inc\. Minneapolis 
49jc020x But we\'re seeing some strong buying here 
49jc020y We\'re seeing a whole bunch of stocks breaking out of their trading ranges 
49jc020z The Soviets obviously want to make it as difficult as possible for NATO to carry out its modernization said one Western diplomat in Bonn 
49jc0210 A senior NATO diplomat accused the Soviets of trying to seduce the Germans away from us 
49jc0211 It is none too subtle wedge driving he told Reuters 
49jc0212 But at another operation in rural northern Illinois there are hardly any minorities to draw from 
49jc0213 We picked that location because we needed the river access there to be successful Mr\. Thompson says 
49jc0214 [tongue_click] I know I have a social responsibility 
49jc0215 But I also have a responsibility to my shareholders 
49jc0216 Champion said about twenty one hundred workers struck its five lumber and plywood plants in the region over the weekend 
49jc0217 Stamford Connecticut based Champion has fourteen such plants nationwide the spokesman said 
49jc0218 The International Woodworkers of America and the Western Council of Industrial Workers union struck two Champion mills where the contract recently expired according to a Champion spokesman 
49jc0219 [tongue_click] Picket lines erected by those strikers quickly closed the others where contracts either have expired or will expire by July thirty first he added 
49jc021a Tobacco heiress Doris Duke agreed to post five million dollars needed by Imelda Marcos to secure bail on racketeering charges 
49jc021b [tongue_click] Duke is the daughter of the former president of American Tobacco Company . Marcos and her husband the deposed president of the Philippines are accused of looting Manila\'s treasury 
49jc021c [tongue_click] His arraignment has been delayed 
49jc021d Mr\. Jordan was awarded damages of nearly eight thousand dollars and a punitive award of four hundred thousand dollars 
49jc021e The jury also found that Clayton under Missouri common law had breached its fiduciary duties because of self dealing 
49jc021f The appeals court upheld the lower court in October nineteen eighty eight 
49jc0301 The statute allows for a great deal of latitude agrees Arthur Christy the first special prosecutor appointed under the nineteen seventy eight law 
49jc0302 In past investigations he notes the focus has been quite narrow 
49jc0303 [tongue_click] But in each case he suggests It\'s up to the counsel he certainly has the powers 
49jc0304 Also the strong rise in share prices in recent weeks appears to have discounted most of the good news likely in the budget another dealer said 
49jc0305 It\'s going to take quite a lot to move it sharply ahead from this level he said 
49jc0306 The one hundred share index is up eighteen \.POINT six \%PERCENT this year 
49jc0307 [tongue_click] Some tire executives such as John J\. Nevin chief executive officer of Firestone Tire and Rubber Company say Mr\. Stone understands the industry\'s problems 
49jc0308 But Mr\. Stone\'s union critics aren\'t so generous 
49jc0309 They say he has been lax about organizing new members for example 
49jc030a [tongue_click] Under the agreement subject to regulatory approval [tongue_click] Ypsilanti shareholders would receive one \.POINT nine three five shares of Trustcorp common for each common share of Ypsilanti 
49jc030b [tongue_click] Trustcorp said it plans to complete the purchase in the fourth quarter 
49jc030c [tongue_click] Ypsilanti Savings Bank has about one hundred thirty eight million dollars in assets 
49jc030d Trustcorp Inc\. is a holding company with assets of four \.POINT six billion dollars 
49jc030e Critics of indexing charge that the approach lacks imagination and amounts to settling for mediocrity 
49jc030f Advocates reply that indexing means lower management fees than those of actively managed bond funds 
49jc030g Also [tongue_click] indexing in recent years often has produced significantly better results than many active managers 
49jc030h But John Smale P\. and G\'s chairman and chief executive used the meeting to speak at length about hostile takeovers in general 
49jc030i He maintained that too often they leave companies loaded with debt and shrunken research budgets and ignore the interests of employees and the communities in which the companies do business 
49jc030j [tongue_click] He also argued that over the long run hostile takeovers don\'t necessarily provide a good mechanism for shareholders to realize full value for their shares 
49jc030k [tongue_click] A French press report said the exports include sophisticated equipment for making semiconductors 
49jc030l [tongue_click] It said the machinery may have helped the Soviets build advanced computer memories for such military purposes as missile guidance 
49jc030m Western nations have reached agreements intended to forbid exports of such equipment to the Soviets 
49jc030n When stocks are rising portfolio insurers don\'t hedge and instead ride the market higher 
49jc030o When stocks are falling portfolio insurers sell stock index futures in effect cushioning the values of their stock portfolios from the full brunt of a dropping market 
49jc030p [tongue_click] The idea according to Wall Street proponents [loud_breath] is to provide protection at a low cost 
49jc030q As a manager Mr\. O\'Malley concedes he pushes subordinates to work long and hard hours if necessary 
49jc030r But as a boss I pick my spots to be tough he adds 
49jc030s I also like to let professionals show how good they can be on their own 
49jc030t December delivery gold settled at four hundred eighty two dollars seventy cents for a decline of twelve dollars eighty cents 
49jc030u [tongue_click] December silver fell thirty three \.POINT three cents to six dollars six forty five 
49jc030v [tongue_click] January platinum was down thirteen dollars sixty cents to four hundred ninety dollars forty cents 
49jc030w Yesterday people close to Federated\'s board said that the company was still open to yet another friendly merger proposal from Campeau 
49jc030x If they\'ve got something to show us we\'ll take a look at it 
49jc030y They know where to find us said one source 
49jc030z We\'re not stonewalling them 
49jc0310 Car sales apparently have leveled off after disappointing results early in the year followed by a sharp uptick in late January 
49jc0311 Bigger incentives fueled the rebound and have helped sustain the sales pace 
49jc0312 Chrysler Corporation for example boosted cash rebates to two thousand five hundred dollars on some models 
49jc0313 [tongue_click] Given the nature of our ownership it\'s obviously a very complex issue Mr\. Elish said 
49jc0314 There are a lot of things to consider and we\'re looking at it 
49jc0315 But nothing is imminent 
49jc0316 [tongue_click] It does not however seem reasonable to the Germans who are instead mulling a tax increase to shore up a leaky government budget 
49jc0317 [tongue_click] As for the U\. S\. comments on German inflation a typical German might respond Zero inflation 
49jc0318 What\'s wrong with that 
49jc0319 Generally there\'s no limit on how much of their funds employees can borrow if their accounts total ten thousand dollars or less 
49jc031a For larger accounts employees are restricted to borrowing half the total but no more than fifty thousand dollars 
49jc031b [tongue_click] Loans must be repaid within five years unless the money goes toward buying a principal residence in which case longer repayment terms can be arranged 
49jc031c Borrowed funds aren\'t taxed 
49jc031d But a withdrawal is treated as taxable income and is subject to an additional ten \%PERCENT penalty tax 
49jc0401 Like Drexel Mr\. Icahn has been subpoenaed in connection with the government\'s continuing investigation of the Boesky scandal 
49jc0402 [tongue_click] A subpoena is a request for information and doesn\'t imply any wrongdoing 
49jc0403 Mr\. Icahn\'s lawyers at Weil Gotschal and Manges in New York said the investigation had absolutely no connection with the withdrawal of Mr\. Icahn\'s bid 
49jc0404 But Mr\. Gibbs is hopeful that many taxpayers will accept 
49jc0405 [tongue_click] Among other incentives the new tax law phases out the deductibility of interest payments to the I\. R\. S\. 
49jc0406 The I\. R\. S\. also has been successful in Tax Court challenges to people involved in tax shelters 
49jc0407 We\'re winning more than we\'re losing the I\. R\. S\. chief points out 
49jc0408 Doubleday also provided Bertelsmann with much needed U\. S\. book manufacturing operations 
49jc0409 [tongue_click] Moreover [tongue_click] Mr\. Vitale says it\'s worth a premium to get a foothold in the U\. S\. market 
49jc040a [tongue_click] If you are in publishing the only market with large numbers is the English speaking market he says 
49jc040b Many people however claim that irresponsible owners not the dogs themselves are to blame for the high incidence of attacks 
49jc040c They\'re immoral says an official of the United Kennel Club a prestigious pedigree association 
49jc040d They\'ll do what the trainer allows them to do 
49jc040e K\. mart and Bruno\'s said their hypermarkets which haven\'t been named yet will include specialty shops 
49jc040f The facilities will cover about two hundred twenty five thousand square feet or three times the space of the average K\. mart discount department store 
49jc040g Located in major metropolitan areas they will be totally distinct from the current operations of both companies a prepared statement said 
49jc040h The first is expected to open next year 
49jc040i What\'s more [tongue_click] a further drop in the dollar could have the very result Mr\. Baker seeks to avoid higher interest rates 
49jc040j In order to keep persuading foreign investors to hold cheaper dollars the Federal Reserve must keep U\. S\. interest rates higher than those abroad 
49jc040k An even weaker dollar could require higher rates 
49jc040l [tongue_click] Under terms of the original agreement Computer Memories would have issued new shares of its own in exchange for shares of closely held Hemdale 
49jc040m Current Hemdale holders then would have owned about seventy eight \%PERCENT of Computer Memories\' shares 
49jc040n The surviving company would have been named Hemdale Film Corp\. and John Daly Hemdale\'s current chairman would have become chief executive officer of the surviving company 
49jc040o A spokesman for Cray described the M\. I\. T\. decision as good news 
49jc040p Assuming the bidding does open up again it means there\'s room for technical considerations and not considerations based purely on price 
49jc040q The spokesman said it would have been impossible for Cray to install and operate a complete supercomputer system at the prices M\. I\. T\. wanted to pay 
49jc040r [tongue_click] With technology like this the company that invented the overnight express business fourteen years ago still dominates it 
49jc040s Federal Express collects more than half the revenue in what is now more than a six billion dollar industry 
49jc040t And at a time when deteriorating service is a national malady this company claims to deliver more than ninety nine \%PERCENT of its letters and packages on time 
49jc040u Housing starts totaled one million six hundred seventy four thousand three hundred units last year up twenty two \.POINT seven \%PERCENT from nineteen eighty six 
49jc040v In December alone starts rose twenty \.POINT eight \%PERCENT to one hundred fifty five thousand five hundred eighty nine units 
49jc040w [tongue_click] That marked the twentieth consecutive monthly increase 
49jc040x Early February North American built car sales edged up zero \.POINT three \%PERCENT according to figures reported last week 
49jc040y That translates into a seasonally adjusted annual rate of eight \.POINT one million vehicles compared with a seven \.POINT seven million rate a year earlier 
49jc040z [tongue_click] This week\'s mid February report on car sales will tell whether that pace was being maintained 
49jc0410 Of course to a great extent the stock prices of the various companies that will be reporting higher earnings already reflect shareholder expectations 
49jc0411 That obviously will mute the price movement of any particular stock when the company reports its earnings unless analysts\' estimates are seriously out of kilter 
49jc0412 [tongue_click] As portfolio strategists puzzle over the market impact of this wave of good news they come up with some sharply divergent opinions 
49jc0413 [tongue_click] After Larry Speakes lost his job with Merrill Lynch I was a little reluctant to join the posse of critics 
49jc0414 [tongue_click] You hate to kick a guy when he\'s down 
49jc0415 [tongue_click] But something made me change my mind 
49jc0416 I read his book 
49jc0417 Monarch Capital rose two to forty one and three quarters 
49jc0418 [tongue_click] The company which is in the process of buying one million of its common shares said it will purchase another one million shares 
49jc0419 Monarch has about seven \.POINT two million shares outstanding 
49jc041a Overall consumer spending has slowed since last year\'s stock market crash but it\'s still at a level that worries some economists 
49jc041b Consumer credit slowed sharply in July reflecting sluggish sales 
49jc041c Too much spending at home coupled with heavy demand for exports could overload an industrial sector that is already running near capacity 
49jc041d The front page of the third section displays the day\'s top news from equity credit and other markets in the U\. S\. and abroad 
49jc041e Your Money Matters has been moved to this page 
49jc041f [tongue_click] Also appearing there are Markets Diary and Investment Insights two graphic summaries of market trends 
49kc0201 The International Security and Development Cooperation Act of nineteen eighty five directed the president to appoint a task force on the Project Economic Justice for Central America and the Caribbean 
49kc0202 Congress charged the group was developing a plan for the expanded use of employee stock ownership plans as a mean for broadening the capital ownership base there 
49kc0203 Mr\. Reagan named senior diplomat and financier J\. William Middendorf the second the former U\. S\. Ambassador to the Organization of American States as chairman 
49kc0204 The system isn\'t a hundred \%PERCENT perfect but it\'s working reasonably well a Foreign Minister official told reporters 
49kc0205 The official said the U\. S\. has been primarily reassured 
49kc0206 Even so the U\. S\. has indicated that it wants Japan to take better care of how Japanese technology is sold around the world 
49kc0207 Last month auto sales fell one \.POINT four \%PERCENT after rising five \.POINT seven \%PERCENT in August 
49kc0208 Sales of building materials increased one \.POINT two \%PERCENT after a \.POINT four \%PERCENT drop 
49kc0209 Overall sales of durable goods which are intended to last three years or more fell \.POINT nine \%PERCENT after rising three \.POINT one \%PERCENT in August 
49kc020a Merrill\'s stock rose three and three eighths to twenty nine and three eighths 
49kc020b L\. F\. Rothschild Holdings rose one and three quarters to eight and three eighths 
49kc020c The firm\'s co chief executive said it is meeting all of its capital requirements 
49kc020d Salomon Incorporated rose three to twenty five E\. F\. Hutton gained one and seven eighths to eighteen and five eighths PaineWebber added one to eighteen <and> and a quarter 
49kc020e The bill if it becomes law would bar hostile acquirers from merging their targets for three years after an offer is launched except under certain conditions 
49kc020f The Delaware House of Representatives unanimously passed the legislation Tuesday 
49kc020g The Senate is expected to approve it today 
49kc020h One of the best known international stock pickers John Templeton nearly equaled the index without any Japanese stocks in his small Templeton Foreign fund 
49kc020i He did so via winning bets in such markets as Mexico Canada and Britain 
49kc020j We were very fortunate he said 
49kc020k His larger funds which can include U\. S\. stocks didn\'t fare as well 
49kc020l Turnout is another unknown factor 
49kc020m To capitalize here Governor Dukakis would like to see a heavy turnout especially in such pockets of strength as the Chicago lakefront and suburbs 
49kc020n But that may not happen Illinois registration is below nineteen eighty four and no presidential candidate has yet caught fire 
49kc020o The networks have begun the delicate craft of spinning the numbers to their benefit and of putting the best shine on a dismal television season 
49kc020p C\. B\. S\. held a news briefing last Friday 
49kc020q A\. B\. C\. hosts one today N\. B\. C\. will do so tomorrow 
49kc020r Some rules governing the ability to stay in business takes effect Friday 
49kc020s But Professor Pennington says it will be twelve months before businesses begin to lose their authorization 
49kc020t Regulators he says can\'t be too hard on people who justifiably claim they haven\'t had time to comply 
49kc020u Anyone who accepts the job of investigating the Speaker should be prepared to take some heat 
49kc020v Last week Common Cause called for an investigation of Mr\. Wright\'s finances 
49kc020w The Speaker retaliated in a public statement and his minions in the leadership said the group was dead on Capitol Hill 
49kc020x The whole environment has changed he says 
49kc020y We have a lot more options than we did before 
49kc020z He\'s planning on spending seven million dollars on advertising and promotion this year compared with a couple of million dollars in the past 
49kc0210 Condom sales for the entire industry were up twenty seven \%PERCENT for the twelve months ended in April 
49kc0211 Carter Wallace\'s share amounts to over fifty \%PERCENT of the total market 
49kc0212 Mr\. Chatichai\'s wealthy family background and his family\'s large property interests give him a good understanding of the business community 
49kc0213 Further he has good relations with the large ethnic Chinese community and serves as a chairman of the Thai Chinese Friendship Association 
49kc0214 That\'s important for the country\'s business elite many of whom are ethnic Chinese 
49kc0215 As a result the Sequoia won\'t be going back to the U\. S\. Navy this year 
49kc0216 Or perhaps any year 
49kc0217 And the ship which was used by eight U\. S\. presidents might even go under 
49kc0218 The Treasury is scheduled to announce details of its quarterly financing operation November second 
49kc0219 It usually consists of three year notes ten year notes and thirty year bonds 
49kc021a But the department is very close to reaching its limits on issuing long term debt and thus has asked the Congress to increase its authority 
49kc021b Congress still has completed work on the issue which is part of the tax bill passed late Tuesday by the Senate 
49kc021c In recent months Spicer has cut its one thousand member U\. S\. staff by ten \%PERCENT in an effort to cut costs 
49kc021d Mr\. Bernstein said that a merger of the two firms world wide would create an international organization of one billion dollars in annual revenue 
49kc021e We believe Spicer is a very good niche firm but our merger discussions are very early at this point he said 
49kc0301 In addition to the war of nerves over discounts retail executives said this Christmas season has been characterized by the absence of a big hit in the toy department 
49kc0302 But retailers have seen strong sales of big ticket items to well heeled customers 
49kc0303 They are buying to beat the new tax law which will end the deduction of sales taxes and some interest expenses 
49kc0304 It\'s about as interesting as yesterday\'s tuna fish said Maryann Keller an auto analyst with Furman Selz Mager Dietz and Birney 
49kc0305 The Japanese are going to have a heck of a time selling two \.POINT three million cars in nineteen eighty seven 
49kc0306 I\'m not sure holding quotas does them any harm 
49kc0307 Ms\. Bass won\'t discuss strategy for I\. Magnin 
49kc0308 But industry observers say I\. Magnin like other retailers in today\'s saturated markets will have to establish a more focused identity 
49kc0309 Ms\. Bass also will have to reassess the value of some of its scattered stores including those in Chicago Washington and Arizona and increase sales volume 
49kc030a That\'s the only cure says Mark Shulman president of Limited Incorporated\'s Henri Bendel and a former executive at I\. Magnin and Bloomingdale\'s 
49kc030b While all West German political parties agree on the need for tax cuts for about twenty two billion dollars they differ on who should benefit 
49kc030c The Social Democrats and the left wing Greens want the cuts to help the poor and the working class 
49kc030d Within the ruling coalition the liberal Free Democrats and the Bavarian sister party of the Christian Democrats the Christian Socialists want cuts spread across the board 
49kc030e His answer Raise the temperature artificially in the morning by jogging or with a hot drink 
49kc030f Breakfast also helps as does jumping into a hot shower on awakening 
49kc030g At the opposite end Morning people take naps 
49kc030h A fifteen to twenty minute nap at two or three p\. m\. will give them more energy 
49kc030i Mr\. Walsh\'s legal theory about the flow of funds is likely to be the linchpin of an effort to bring broader conspiracy and other criminal charges 
49kc030j Central targets of the investigation include former National Security Adviser John Poindexter former White House aide Oliver North and retired Air Force Major General Richard Secord 
49kc030k A final decision on seeking charges could come in September 
49kc030l In the two selected areas the state will allow procurement and retail prices to rise to what the open market demands 
49kc030m The *subsidy* for consumers is meant to reduce the strain on urban residents 
49kc030n Farmers of course will get higher prices for their grain from the market which in turn should induce them to increase production 
49kc030o Grain production throughout China has faltered in recent years in part because state procurement prices were too low 
49kc030p Remember the one about the investment banker 
49kc030q It was a widely told circa October nineteen nineteen eighty seven and went like this What do you call an investment banker 
49kc030r Hey waiter 
49kc030s Hardliners for instance want a law that bans all obscene and indecent speech over the telephone 
49kc030t The battle should be carried to the Supreme Court argues Representative William Dannemeyer a California Republican 
49kc030u Dial a porn he says moves sexuality from the human level to the animal level 
49kc030v These are very interesting times says Richard Shaffer an industry consultant and analyst who publishes Technologic Computer Letter 
49kc030w A year ago it seemed that I\. B\. M\. and Microsoft alone would dictate the standards for desktop computers in the office 
49kc030x Now after Apple\'s lawsuit challenging Microsoft and Sun coming up with Open Look for Unix we have the possibility of seeing three very competitive standards 
49kc030y The government\'s official armed forces magazines traditionally have been off limits to all advertisers 
49kc030z But recently the Army and Navy considered farming theirs out to commercial publishers who would accept ads 
49kc0310 We\'re exploring it to see how much money we could save on our Soldiers magazine an Army spokesman says 
49kc0311 All this reflects a mood of transition and uncertainty that has gripped Britain\'s publicly subsidized theater in recent years 
49kc0312 Fretting about finances most companies are taking fewer creative risks 
49kc0313 Audiences in turn have grown more conservative 
49kc0314 Yet there\'s more work performed now than in years mainly to keep revenues flowing 
49kc0315 The Tigers don\'t like to stress the source of their baseball prowess 
49kc0316 The team\'s press releases say the team has English born and bred players 
49kc0317 Under questioning in the stadium pub Mr\. Hunt admits to having recruited a Dutchman a Pakistani and an American third baseman 
49kc0318 The suggested retail price for Cinderella is twenty six dollars and ninety nine cents and for E\. T\. twenty four dollars and ninety five cents 
49kc0319 But both have been heavily discounted as much as nine dollars a cassette and both have rebate offers 
49kc031a The home video industry is hoping the massive purchases of both cassettes will turn many cassette renters into at least occasional buyers in the future 
49kc031b There are still legislative issues to be resolved on the Senate floor and among four House committees before the bill reaches the House floor 
49kc031c Business groups for example are unhappy at provisions requiring bus companies to install wheelchair lifts and handicapped toilets in new over the road buses 
49kc031d The groups also criticize the lack of a blanket small business exemption for public accommodations 
49kc031e But many other business objections have been dealt with in the White House Senate negotiations pretty much eliminating the chances that the measure could be derailed 
49kc0401 Now he sells knockoff Gucci and Rolex watches starting at fifty dollars apiece to the secretaries at his prep school 
49kc0402 My strategy is to get them alone he s- explains 
49kc0403 Then later they can show off their watches and brag about their generous husbands 
49kc0404 Robert E\. Wunderle vice president of public affairs for Supermarkets General says the company has held discussions in good faith with the Hafts 
49kc0405 He added that the company is disappointed that the Hafts have chosen to publicize the contents of a letter filled with half truths and distortions 
49kc0406 He declined to elaborate 
49kc0407 Mr\. Junger previously has denied any wrongdoing and has said he isn\'t responsible for the curren:cy loss 
49kc0408 He was summarily dismissed by the company when the currency loss came to light ending his severance contract that was to run until September 
49kc0409 He resigned from V\. W\. in January over differences on how the auto maker\'s foreign exchange department should be run 
49kc040a The world is made up of optimists and pessimists says Mr\. Stone 
49kc040b In this industry in this state they\'re mostly pessimists 
49kc040c I may be the last optimist but I\'m sure I\'m right 
49kc040d Quebec Energy Minister John Ciaccia said the provincially owned utility plans to appeal the ruling to the Federal Court of Canada 
49kc040e New England utility and energy officials said the decision isn\'t a cause for serious concern yet because of the appeal 
49kc040f They added that there\'s still time for the New York utilities to seek alternative energy sources 
49kc040g The window of opportunity for the creation of superregional banks might not be open long 
49kc040h Then we will face the challenge of consolidating our positions 
49kc040i It\'s going to be tough 
49kc040j What has distinguished us is that our returns on assets and equity are far above average 
49kc040k Maintaining those levels that\'s going to be the challenge 
49kc040l A Howard Metzenbaum staffer successfully and possibly criminally intimidated a black law professor into canceling his testimony 
49kc040m Jewel LaFontant had to risk a threatened boycott of Revlon to *testify* for Judge Bork 
49kc040n A Harris Poll that included a falsified quote from Judge Bork was trumpeted to prove that most Americans opposed Judge Bork 
49kc040o Ford\'s fourth quarter sales were eighteen \.POINT eight billion dollars up fifteen \%PERCENT from sixteen \.POINT three billion dollars a year earlier 
49kc040p Full year sales rose fourteen \%PERCENT to seventy one \.POINT six billion dollars from sixty two \.POINT seven billion dollars 
49kc040q That large jump enabled Ford to increase its share of the U\. S\. new car market to twenty \.POINT two \%PERCENT from eighteen \.POINT two \%PERCENT 
49kc040r After his orientation Mr\. Boesky will be assigned a regular job 
49kc040s Though he can state a preference Mr\. Sams says Mr\. Boesky will go where the prison needs him 
49kc040t He noted that *many* of the most desirable jobs are snapped up by inmates with more seniority 
49kc040u The desirable jobs Mr\. Sams said are at the prison\'s factory which makes wooden furniture for federal offices the dairy farm and the slaughterhouse 
49kc040v Meanwhile Audi set up a bonus plan to encourage dealership salespeople to sell Audi eighty and ninety cars newer models that carry far less generous incentives 
49kc040w Under the bonus plan Audi promised to give sales people two hundred and fifty dollars every time they sold an eighty or ninety model 
49kc040x Law officials from the Federal Trade Commission and several states have said they are opening inquiries into Audi\'s rebates 
49kc040y More states are considering such legislation which is being promoted by Irish American politician and pressure groups and which S:inn F:ein supports 
49kc040z We expect to face challenges in <a> quite a number of states says Simon Johnston of the province\'s Department of Economic Development 
49kc0410 We could have had more American funds and we have not got them and Macbride is part of the reason the department\'s Gerry Lavery says

49mc0409 The agency may also challenge past charges to the Pentagon

49mc040b It\'s the life of a entrepreneur and the fate of creativity in a modern financially oriented America Mr\. Lucas says warming to the subject 
49mc040c It\'s about what happens to a society when it grows old and tries to keep the status quo instead of letting its more creative instincts take over

49mc040e Bullion dealers say the five houses fixing the gold price have to respond to the needs of the market and requirements of British financial legislation

49mc040h Saboteurs are our biggest problem says Mr\. Cairo referring to the bevy of people who shield the debtor

49mc040k The opposition is already rolling 
49mc040l Many of the pressure groups that campaigned unsuccessfully against Mr\. Reagan in two presidential campaigns seem to regard this battle as their Armageddon 
49mc040m Teddy Kennedy himself has testified that Judge Bork\'s appearance means the end is near 
49mc040n If Ronald Reagan wants Robert Bork confirmed he will have to create an alternative choice to the one these groups are trying to force on undecided senators 
49mc040o That means Mr\. Reagan has to explain clearly why American society will benefit if judges such as Robert Bork apply the law in a neutral manner 
49mc040p He will have to point out why many of the long held grievances of electorate result when unelected judges manufacture new laws 
49mc040q [tongue_click] Mr\. Antoniu\'s fall and surprising rebound prove there is life after insider trading 
49mc040r But his story also suggests that some character traits that may give rise to insider trading can be hard to change 
49mc040s Insider trading is a form of fraud and some Sport About franchisees now claim they have been defrauded by Mr\. Antoniu 
49mc040t Pet owners often call a pet psychic because a pet is sick and they want a detailed account of how it\'s feeling 
49mc040u And some pet psychics claim they can chat with pets from a distance 
49mc040v For example Gay Travers a former publicist called pet psychic Penelope Smith when her cat Sebastian was very ill 
49mc040w Ms\. Smith told her to hang up while the psychic talked to Sebastian 
49mc040x Three minutes later she called back with some bad news 
49mc040y Lost wages Some economists are dismayed at the Labor Department\'s plans to drop the hourly earnings index from its monthly employment report next year 
49mc040z It\'s a fashionable number says Mr\. Chandross of Lloyd\'s Bank New York 
49mc0410 Economists are currently focusing on the index to get a reading on wage inflation 
49mc0411 The Labor Department will continue to report monthly aggregate data on average hourly earnings 
49mc0412 But the index is being replaced by the employment cost series 
49mc0413 Economists say the new index has the advantage of being a more reliable reading and the disadvantage of coming out only once a quarter rather than every month 
49mc0414 Newspaper costs are up sharply this year largely because of higher newsprint prices the industry\'s biggest cost behind labor expenses 
49mc0415 Since October nineteen eighty six prices have risen three times by a total of about twenty one \%PERCENT 
49mc0416 Newspapers have responded by using lighter weight paper trimming page size and cutting the space for news 
49mc0417 Meanwhile civil R\. I\. C\. O\. continues to attract plaintiffs who want to turn general business disputes that belong in state courts into federal offenses 
49mc0418 For example a small consortium of contractors who consulted me had submitted the low bid for a large marina to be constructed on Lake Michigan 
49mc0419 The second lowest bidder recently filed a civil R\. I\. C\. O\. action claiming that misrepresentations were made by the successful bidders using the telephone thereby committing federal wire fraud 
49mc041a No matter what the determination of the suit the low bidders have already felt the sting of such poisonous words as racketeer 
49mc041b Federal funds nine \%PERCENT high eight and three quarters \%PERCENT low eight and seven eighths \%PERCENT near closing bid eight and fifteen sixteenths \%PERCENT offered

49nc0201 One problem with the development of the unpopular new W\. four form is that the I\. R\. S\. failed to test it adequately 
49nc0202 In fact the form wasn\'t shown to the public at all 
49nc0203 It was presented only to I\. R\. S\. employees in two of the agency\'s service centers 
49nc0204 Officials suggest that these clerical non technical workers really aren\'t much different from the general public 
49nc0205 Still Mr\. Gibbs concedes that the agency probably should have sought a wider view 
49nc0206 Mr\. Joynes will oversee the company\'s operating units as well as the company\'s research activities and staff support services the company said

49nc0210 Many people criticized ads that glorify junk 
49nc0211 Some singled out as contradictory a cooking oil ad telling people how to cut down on cholesterol but featuring fried chicken and french fries 
49nc0212 It\'s also dishonest some said to omit information or hide it in small print

49nc0219 So far from a market viewpoint [door_slam] it doesn\'t look to be much of an event 
49nc021a Ever since he took office three and a half years ago Mr\. Gorbachev has sought to increase foreign trade\'s meager share of the Soviet economy 
49nc021b Rather than simply import more Western goods he would like to obtain the machinery and know how to enable the Soviets to make the goods themselves 
49nc021c To do so he opened up the economy to foreign capital and equipment by permitting joint ventures

49nc030l I\. R\. E\. has downsized its real estate syndication business and is primarily a savings and loan holding company Mr\. Levan said 
49nc030m Earnings in the past were somewhat erratic quarter to quarter because the major business was real estate syndication 
49nc030n Now the S\. and L\. holding company is the main business with down sized real estate syndication 
49nc030o Core earnings are very consistent 
49nc030p Another option would be going private in a leveraged buy out 
49nc030q But analysts said management wouldn\'t prefer such a plan because it would mean curtailing the company\'s ambitious store expansion program 
49nc030r In a leveraged buy out a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely with borrowing 
49nc030s Ultimately the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company\'s operations or the sale of its assets

49nc030y A spokesman for Cray described the M\. I\. T\. decision as good news

49qc021a In any case a return to market discipline is inevitable 
49qc021b Financial history has witnessed a thousand booms and busts 
49qc021c Within recent memory we have seen the junk equities of the sixties the heated Third World lending of the seventies and the thrift crisis of the eighties 
49qc021d These problems of the recent past pale in scope next to the pervasiveness and total dollars involved in the current craze 
49qc021e If the participants in this craze awaken now the correction may still be within tolerable limits for the country 
49qc021f If not all of America will pay the penalty because the debt is huge and widely held and the banking structure\'s integrity would be at stake

49qc0304 It\'s so shunned that although most managers going up the ladder are occasionally required to fire once having ascended to the top they delegate the job 
49qc0305 Andrew Sherwood a New York management consultant says that only about five \%PERCENT of chief executives do their own firing 
49qc0306 These are people who are compulsive builders he says 
49qc0307 They like acquiring companies making profits go up and recruiting people 
49qc0308 Firing isn\'t what they\'re emotionally geared for 
49qc0309 They find it repugnant 
49qc030a Defenders of the footnote argue that it makes sense as tax policy 
49qc030b Why they ask should wealthy best selling authors get substantial tax deferrals while mom and pop manufacturers for example can\'t

49qc030e Mr\. Amman forty nine years old said he believes Western Union\'s debt and equity holders will support the restructuring 
49qc030f He added that the restructuring must be completed in the next few weeks because the company is running short of cash 
49qc030g Western Union has said that if its plans are defeated it will file for reorganization under Chapter eleven of the federal bankruptcy laws

49qc030i Other courts notably the one in charge of the Manville Corporation Chapter eleven proceedings have set up trust funds to pay large classes of injury victims 
49qc030j But Manville\'s two \.POINT five billion dollar to three billion dollar trust includes provisions that allow it to expand if funds prove inadequate to pay asbestos related claims

49qc030m They\'re trying to get the biggest bang for the buck right now the trader says

49qc0407 Like their economies the currencies of the U\. S\. and Canada are closely related 
49qc0408 But as interest rates rise in Canada the Canadian dollar is gaining on its U\. S\. counterpart traders and analysts say

49rc020z Another potential point of contention is the E\. C\.\'s plan to allow the free flow of people across borders 
49rc0210 Switzerland already has attracted one million resident aliens a portion of its population greater than in any E\. C\. state except Luxembourg 
49rc0211 Most Swiss think that is enough and the country has imposed foreign worker quotas so strict that skilled labor is in short supply 
49rc0212 Yet if Switzerland closes its door to more E\. C\. nationals Swiss who work in the E\. C\. may find themselves less welcome

49rc0301 The new government has started to lower personal income taxes and at the same time it has begun to bring its own spending under control 
49rc0302 In the nineteen eighty seven budget the highest rate of income tax was lowered to fifty eight \%PERCENT from sixty five \%PERCENT 
49rc0303 This is part of a world wide movement that France must follow to keep its most energetic aggressive and bright young people and to attract investors 
49rc0304 The new tax law\'s limits on retirement benefits for executives spur greater interest in certain trusts that help safeguard deferred compensation until retirement time 
49rc0305 Such trusts aren\'t completely inviolate creditors can claim the money after a bankruptcy for instance 
49rc0306 But they are considered better than a mere promise to the executive 
49rc0307 [tongue_click] The Diet is a one house legislature apportioned by district rather than population like the Senate as opposed to the House

49rc0313 [tongue_click] Still Ms\. Freedman noted that a bright forecast for hiring isn\'t necessarily all good news

49rc0316 Richard Roslund a vice president of block trading at Kidder Peabody said the Fed chairman\'s remarks gave the market a reason to adopt a more positive outlook 
49rc0317 People are just looking for anything to grasp on he said 
49rc0318 It\'s been such a pessimistic atmosphere in the past couple of weeks 
49rc0319 Analysts say they expect P\. and G\'s momentum to carry into nineteen ninety and beyond and many raised their fiscal nineteen ninety estimates 
49rc031a Brenda Lee Landry of Morgan Stanley raised her estimate to eight dollars and thirty from an earlier estimate of eight dollars and fifteen 
49rc031b Kidder\'s Mr\. Freedman and Joseph Kozloff at Drexel Burnham Lambert raised their estimates to eight dollars fifty a share from eight dollars twenty five 
49rc031c [lip_smack] I can see a number close to ten dollars for nineteen ninety one says Mr\. Kozloff 
49rc031d Europe by contrast offers a cornucopia of undervalued corporations and a wave of industrial restructuring stemming from its drive toward a single market by nineteen ninety two

49rc0412 Separately Judge Browning issued a ruling on the award of any damages in the case 
49rc0413 For claims in the federal case the standard of damages is out of pocket or investors\' loss on the bonds 
49rc0414 For Washington state claims the standard is recission which could mean repaying bondholders their purchase price 
49rc0415 The dispute is a classic confrontation between market philosophies

49sc0205 It might be seen as a victory for Kodak says Alex

49sc0207 Yesterday Kodak climbed two and three quarters to seventy five and three eighths

49sc020e Laszlo Birinyi Junior vice president for Salomon\'s equity market analysis group says We\'re trying to provide reliable consistent information on global securities 
49sc020f Bankers say Chile Mexico and the Philippines have accounted for most of the estimated six billion dollars of debt equity swaps to date 
49sc020g Some bankers have estimated that the total may rise as high as ten billion dollars this year 
49sc020h Such swaps only began about three years ago 
49sc020i Albert Gross chief economist at Refco Incorporated agreed 
49sc020j The bond market was helped temporarily by a decline in gold and other commodity prices a strengthening dollar and a stock market rally he said 
49sc020k But I expect the dollar to continue falling and that will accelerate inflation pressures 
49sc020l The best numbers on inflation are behind us 
49sc020m Most of the damage to stock prices came in the late afternoon as bond prices sagged adding fuel to the fire of interest rate fears 
49sc020n Bonds in turn seemed to be reacting to a decline in the dollar off its highs early in the day 
49sc020o The dollar nevertheless showed a gain for the day against both the yen and the West German mark 
49sc020p Bids totaling three hundred and seventy six million dollars were submitted 
49sc020q Accepted bids ranged from seven \.POINT one five \%PERCENT to seven \.POINT one seven three \%PERCENT

49sc020s Mr\. Reagan\'s comments don\'t reflect any change in his interpretation of the deficit reduction agreement 
49sc020t At the insistence of the White House the plan specifically noted that the president could either sign or veto the specific taxes Congress chooses 
49sc020u And the administration has said before that it isn\'t happy with the provision on takeovers 
49sc020v However such an agreement may yet occur 
49sc020w There\'s a lot of brewing here said one source close to Apple 
49sc020x This is only the first of several related announcements and undertakings 
49sc020y The source said technical agreements are easier to hammer out than marketing agreements 
49sc020z Mobil based in New York said its fourth quarter net income jumped ninety two \%PERCENT 
49sc0210 The latest quarter included a one hundred and forty million dollar write down of foreign inventories 
49sc0211 Revenue rose twenty five \%PERCENT to fifteen \.POINT sixty six billion dollars from twelve \.POINT five billion dollars 
49sc0212 In recent months the quota program itself has become increasingly controversial 
49sc0213 Some big U\. S\. steelmakers which sell semifinished steel in the domestic marketplace are fighting to continue quotas after their scheduled expiration September thirtieth 
49sc0214 Others though dependent on outside supplies of semifinished are pushing to end quotas 
49sc0215 [tongue_click] The Singapore government invites foreign newspapers to print the truth about Singapore 
49sc0216 But why has The Asian Wall Street Journal refused to print government replies correcting errors and biases in its reporting 
49sc0217 Why does it deny the Singapore government the simple right of reply 
49sc0218 One big play last year was leisure 
49sc0219 Another was undervalued assets even though no one can recall a Japanese company being broken up for its assets 
49sc021a Once you get that theme the level of the P\. E\. ratio doesn\'t mean a damn says Mr\. Robins 
49sc021b It\'s all a bit of a mirage 
49sc021c Yet one that so far has worked 
49sc021d Nine month results also include a twelve million dollar net loss from the disposition of trucking operations 
49sc021e About eight million dollars of the trucking charge was taken in the third quarter 
49sc021f Year earlier results were restated for accounting changes

49sc0302 The average Japanese didn\'t have freezer space let alone an oven 
49sc0303 And the most common response to supermarket taste tests was that cheese looked and tasted like soap she recalls 
49sc0304 But she kept going peddling her pizzas to restaurants and fancy hotels 
49sc0305 Smokers are feeling the heat because companies are taking a harder line on such issues as productivity rising medical costs and the effects of passive smoke 
49sc0306 Although there are conflicting claims about whether smokers cost employers more in terms of higher insurance rates and absenteeism companies often cite such concerns to justify restrictive smoking policies 
49sc0307 In addition new state and local ordinances and employee complaints put significant pressure on many companies 
49sc0308 [tongue_click] The government civil suit alleged that a defect could cause the rear brakes to lock sending the car spinning out of control 
49sc0309 G\. M\. which no longer makes X\. cars denied that the brakes are defective 
49sc030a Agreeing with G\. M\. Judge Jackson ruled that the government came to court with nothing more essentially than a reasonable suspicion that a defect existed 
49sc030b The suit which also names the company\'s directors as defendants says the directors have given personal gain a priority over the interests of public shareholders 
49sc030c A second suit by Moshe J\. Schwartz Jeffrey Abrams Stanley Heineman and James T\. Cain contains comparable charges 
49sc030d Earlier at least two of those same plaintiffs filed a suit over the Antar stock sales 
49sc030e A loss wasn\'t unexpected given Continental\'s operational difficulties that developed in the quarter 
49sc030f However the results of Texas Air\'s subsidiaries are the reverse of what many analysts had predicted earlier in the year 
49sc030g Instead of a modest profit at low cost Continental by the second quarter the newly expanded unit has struggled with losses 
49sc030h Its higher cost sister Eastern Airlines has shown signs of financial progress despite continuing confrontations with its employee unions 
49sc030i Mr\. Lay said the losses occured in late September and early this month a time of particular volatility in oil markets 
49sc030j There were two senior people colluding and keeping a separate set of books apart from the official books for a few weeks Mr\. Lay said 
49sc030k [sniff] Their guesses were wrong on both sides of the market 
49sc030l An F\. T\. C\. spokesman declined to comment 
49sc030m The investigation was first reported in F\. T\. C\. Watch a publication about regulatory matters 
49sc030n Reached in New York last night Mr\. Trump confirmed that the F\. T\. C\. had made the request 
49sc030o He declined to elaborate 
49sc030p Separately Wall Street speculation grew that media investor Rupert Murdoch was considering acquiring a stake in London based W\. P\. P\. 
49sc030q A Murdoch aide said that Mr\. Murdoch has been looking for a long time at the company 
49sc030r But W\. P\. P\. spokesman said that there has been no contact and there has been no acquisition of W\. P\. P\. shares by Murdoch 
49sc030s Yesterday people close to the Federated\'s board said that the company was still open to yet another friendly merger proposal from Campeau 
49sc030t If they\'ve got something to show us we\'ll take a look at it

49sc030w I can\'t guarantee our group is one hundred \%PERCENT solid said an official at Suez a French holding company 
49sc030x I can\'t tell you that at those prices there won\'t be any reneging on agreements signed by the consortium\'s members 
49sc030y [sniff] But he added such action could lead to legal reprisals 
49sc030z Both sides have worked hard and some progress has been realized in a number of areas said Messrs\. 
49sc0310 Shultz and *Shevardnadze* in a joint statement last night 
49sc0311 But much more needs to be done 
49sc0312 The United Nations whose garbage bill was forty two thousand dollars a month is served by National Carting Company which won the pickup rights eight years ago 
49sc0313 Last December the U\. N\. didn\'t attempt to solicit bids 
49sc0314 It simply extended its contract with National Carting 
49sc0315 Soliciting bids in this particular industry is not the way to go a U\. N\. spokesman says implying that it is futile 
49sc0316 But critics charged that the collar actually added to volatility by making it more difficult for index arbitragers to do their business 
49sc0317 Many traders argue that such arbitrage has the effect of smoothing out volatility in the markets 
49sc0318 Index arbitragers buy and sell large amounts of stocks and stock index futures to take advantage of brief price disparities between the two related instruments 
49sc0319 The scene the Annual Norman Mailer Cocktail Party and Fist Fight 
49sc031a Candice *Bergen* and Woody Allen had just joined a group of pseudo intellectuals and were rambling with the best of them 
49sc031b I often think observed Ms\. *Bergen* that if Dostoevski had been a singer he\'d have sounded like Ray Charles 
49sc031c The other non winners most notably Exxon were in many ways as noteworthy as the winners 
49sc031d It is believed that Exxon was outbid for several reserve packages leaving it with a lot of cash that could still be earmarked for acquisitions 
49sc031e At the Houston Petroleum Club industry officials couldn\'t eat lunch of late without discussing the speculation that Exxon was going to walk away with all of the Tenneco properties 
49sc031f An Exxon spokeswoman said it was company policy not to comment on anything to do with acquisitions 
49sc0401 Also selling well was a fifty million dollar issue of revenue bonds by the Florida Department of Natural Resources 
49sc0402 The unsold balance was about ten \.POINT three million dollars 
49sc0403 The bonds were priced after auction to yield from four \.POINT twenty \%PERCENT in nineteen eighty eight to seven \.POINT twenty \%PERCENT in two thousand and twelve 
49sc0404 Moody\'s rated the bonds single A\. while S\. and P\. rated them single A\. minus 
49sc0405 Goldman Sachs and Company was the lead underwriter 
49sc0406 Still he would have preferred there be no bids at all 
49sc0407 The company\'s policy for eighty five years has been to be independent and grow and we have succeeded he says 
49sc0408 We are evaluating the offers for the company and for the shareholders but we profoundly regret the situation 
49sc0409 So strange is the situation that one Holly director has proposed changing the company\'s name to Fantasy Sugar Company 
49sc040a He says that could entice Shamrock because of its Disney connection to buy the company 
49sc040b Just think of how much they could make on the movie rights he adds 
49sc040c During the past several days corporations and other big investors have refrained from lending Treasury bonds and notes to securities dealers for brief periods 
49sc040d That in turn has forced many dealers to refrain from selling borrowed securities or amassing so called short positions 
49sc040e It\'s hard to short anything in this market at the moment said a trader at a large government securities dealer 
49sc040f Mr\. Antoniu denies any wrongdoing 
49sc040g I don\'t have anything to worry about the former investment banker says 
49sc040h I have always followed the advice of my lawyer and accountants 
49sc040i He says that he has cooperated in an inquiry by Florida officials but that he isn\'t aware the matter has been referred to the attorney general\'s office 
49sc040j In any case he says Sport About\'s problems will be cured by the public offering and are commonplace in any rapidly growing franchise business 
49sc040k Where can we find some clues to the answer or at least a possible answer to this question 
49sc040l I would suggest that we look at the one Marxist Leninist state that already has gone quite far down the revisionist road 
49sc040m I refer to the curiously neglected instance of Yugoslavia 
49sc040n Outside of the congressional leadership patience is wearing thin on pork barreling continuing resolutions 
49sc040o There are even congressmen who say they want to pass separate budget bills this year 
49sc040p We\'ll see 
49sc040q What seems more likely is that either a President or the courts or both someday will have to rescue the veto by forcing Congress to give up its arrogant ways 
49sc040r So far we\'ve found that federal employees have dealt with this issue with a great deal of sensitivity and common sense Mrs\. Horner said 
49sc040s But there is a need for clarity 
49sc040t [lip_smack] These guidelines will serve as reassurance to our managers 
49sc040u Senator Bentsen\'s corporate tax proposal would replace a provision in the committee bill allowing the Internal Revenue Service to withhold refunds from taxpayers who have defaulted on government loans 
49sc040v [sniff] This provision wouldn\'t raise any money in the current fiscal year and Senator Bentsen wanted something that would allow a quicker end to the diesel tax collection 
49sc040w The Texas Democrat plans to offer his substitution when the tax package reaches the Senate floor 
49sc040x [lip_smack] Makers world wide have been racing to develop compact disk recorders

49sc0411 Union Pacific Corporation has rolled two club cars into town to entertain Democrats 
49sc0412 The company is headed by Drew Lewis frequently a troubleshooter for the Republicans 
49sc0413 [tongue_click] The National Association of Realtors is throwing several parties and proudly boasts that eighty nine of its members are delegates or alternates to this convention 
49sc0414 Discussion of this subject better described as brooding about it is filled with misconceptions 
49sc0415 One of these is the great concern with the U\. S\. having become a net debtor 
49sc0416 What is meant by that is that Americans apparently own fewer assets abroad than foreigners own in the U\. S\. 
49sc0417 Many people have pointed out that these calculations are spurious because the assets are not all valued on the same basis 
49sc0418 If all assets were valued at today\'s prices the net debt of the U\. S\. would certainly be much smaller than it now appears and might be a net asset 
49sc0419 Investors taking part in the financing will lend Venezuela one billion dollars in exchange for monthly payments from the New York trust fund 
49sc041a Those payments will be set when the financing is completed which is expected in mid December 
49sc041b The interest rate will be based on the five year U\. S\. Treasury bond rate plus a still undecided interest rate margin the Venezuelan official said 
49sc041c [lip_smack] Investors continue to flock to the more conservative stock portfolios

49tc0201 I\'m very nervous because my view on rates is so close to the consensus Edward *Hyman* of Cyrus J\. Lawrence Inc\. says 
49tc0202 Remember the consensus is usually wrong 
49tc0203 The markets seem determined to make as many economists look as stupid as they possibly can 
49tc0204 I was startled startled isn\'t the word reacted Alvin Novick a biology professor at Yale University 
49tc0205 He warned that forced testing such as contemplated by the centers would drive homosexuals underground and away from cooperation with public health programs 
49tc0206 Rational people won\'t cooperate in ruining their own lives he said 
49tc0207 Local newspapers yesterday said the government may qualify the decision to sign the restructuring agreement

49tc0209 The signing deadline is October first 
49tc020a Other toy makers such as Mattel Inc\. have been bringing out new products earlier in the year to increase sales at times other than Christmas 
49tc020b But Tyco\'s day after Christmas launch is unusual 
49tc020c The toy business is ripe [door_slam] for some marketing innovation after two years of relatively flat sales says Rick Anguilla editor of Toy and Hobby World magazine 
49tc020d If Tyco succeeds others will certainly follow 
49tc020e No one seems quite sure how the publisher juggles his assets among his various companies which include the publicly owned Maxwell Communication Corporation and various private ones 
49tc020f Control of the public company and of private interests like Mirror Group Newspapers Limited rests with a foundation in Liechtenstein Pergamon Holding Foundation about which little is disclosed 
49tc020g He says its beneficiaries are charities which he promises to identify someday soon 
49tc020h The Bank of Italy also reportedly sold marks to buy Italian lire 
49tc020i The transactions may have been directed mainly at defending the sagging lira in the European Monetary System in which eight European currencies float within specified limits 
49tc020j But they also had the effect of helping the dollar by increasing the supply of marks in the market 
49tc020k For Environmental Treatment which like Mr\. Kirk . relishes an extremely low profile . the oil spill has brought a wave of attention 
49tc020l In fact when Wall Street learned that the publicly held company was hired to handle the multimillion dollar cleanup the concern\'s stock shot up almost ten \%PERCENT

49tc020p Down the street from Mr\. Sanchez\'s office Carlos a government mechanic says he goes to many pro *Noriega* demonstrations 
49tc020q The impact will be enormous 
49tc020r The Republicans\' strongest case against the Democratic nominee his naivete on . national security issues will disappear 
49tc020s The suspicion of a selection based entirely on political instead of *substantive* grounds will be undercut 
49tc020t And a message that the current vice president is largely irrelevant will be strongly delivered 
49tc020u Mr\. Tucker\'s hard hitting campaign has in turn appalled top union leaders who say he has tarnished their reputation as one of the labor movement\'s cleanest organizations 
49tc020v The statements of an undercut democratic union may be in bed with management hurt this union said Mr\. Bieber 
49tc020w I resent those statements 
49tc020x Mr\. Delchamps said thirty \%PERCENT of the company\'s stock holdings is held by people who have agreed not to sell their holdings before October thirty first 
49tc020y Another twenty five \%PERCENT is held under the company\'s employee stock ownership plan 
49tc020z Most of the people in the former category are expected to extend the no sell agreement for another year he said 
49tc0210 O\. T\. C\. brokers also stress that their stocks often outperform listed ones on a long term basis 
49tc0211 And overall the Nasdaq Composite Index is up thirteen \%PERCENT this year twice as much as the Dow Jones Industrial Average 
49tc0212 Also they note the tiny stocks that generally trade under three dollars a share have always taken big percentage moves up or down when they move at all 
49tc0213 These mixed feelings of frustration with and gratitude towards the authorities are part of the everyday life of a foreigner doing business in Korea 
49tc0214 [door_slam] In fact such contradictions are what seem to make the Korean world go round 
49tc0215 A Western businessman needs to be ready for them 
49tc0216 [tongue_click] Here are a few hard learned facts of Korean business life 
49tc0217 There are also broker finders that get fees merely for matching borrowers and lenders of stock 
49tc0218 Broker finders can also include the brokerage firms themselves 
49tc0219 The government is investigating whether all the payments that fly to and from such broker finders are legitimate 
49tc021a We are extremely selective says Paul Suckrow director of fixed income at Oppenheimer Management Corp\. 
49tc021b I don\'t think some issues are going to make it he said 
49tc021c Even cautious managers such as Mr\. Suckrow are seeing the impact of the Campeau debacle 
49tc021d He said his firm owns a small amount of the Federated senior debt 
49tc021e Although the bonds are secured by bank credits they have also fallen in price recently 
49tc0301 The computer also can display a pattern showing how people normally place the tongue to produce say an s\. sound 
49tc0302 A deaf person can then try to match the pattern by placing the tongue against the electronic palate

49tc030d People took positions in the stock simply on the rumor of a takeover by someone no one had ever heard of 
49tc030e Some of the full time risk takers don\'t even need public announcements to plunge 
49tc030f Nor do they require inside information a la Ivan Boesky who was venal but [<door_slam] not insane

49tc030q A new date hasn\'t been set 
49tc030r A Unisys spokesman said the companies hope to complete the acquisition which requires Timeplex holders\' approval and government clearance in about four months 
49tc030s At the meeting shareholders approved an increase in authorized common shares to twenty million from fifteen million

49tc030v The U\. S\. of course has a vast and in many places efficient infrastructure 
49tc030w The council study put a value of one trillion dollars on the parts it measured 
49tc030x But government owned fixed capital suffers along with privately owned plant and equipment when economic policies discourage long term investment 
49tc030y The greatest scourge of investment is of course inflation which explains why the national infrastructure suffered particularly during the nineteen seventies 
49tc030z User fees simply could not keep up with the soaring costs of loans and construction 
49tc0310 Highway construction had the added problem of reduced yields from gasoline taxes brought about by energy shortages and shortage enforced conservation 
49tc0311 The measure was a bold move for a president who has come to view inertia as the best form of security 
49tc0312 The suspension effectively will slash salaries and cut an estimated eight \.POINT three billion from federal spending this year 
49tc0313 The aim is to hold the budget deficit to four \.POINT nine \%PERCENT of economic output down from a projected seven \%PERCENT 
49tc0314 This it is hoped will help stop high inflation from spiraling into hyperinflation 
49tc0315 The think tank measured expense ratios which are a fund\'s operating costs as a percentage of assets 
49tc0316 For investors high ratios are clearly of concern 
49tc0317 It cuts into *potential* return even when a fund is doing well 
49tc0318 And it leaves a fund with less of a cushion in case performance sours 
49tc0319 Almost unnoticed in discussions of the procurement scandal is the fact that this elaborate indeed tortuous system seems to have worked at least on its own terms 
49tc031a Nobody was able to throw a contract directly 
49tc031b Instead what some contractors seem to have done is to buy inside information that would allow them to prepare a better proposal 
49tc031c Nine month results also include a twelve million net loss from the disposition of trucking operations 
49tc031d About eight million of the trucking charge was taken in the third quarter 
49tc031e Year earlier results were restated for accounting changes 
49tc031f N\. E\. C\. Corp\. as one example began donating money to M\. I\. T\. in the nineteen seventies

49tc031h C\. and C\. is the N\. E\. C\. corporate slogan it stands for computers and communications 
49tc0401 The big problem is that Doctor Thanos can no longer use so called passive losses from these properties to offset his salary or earned income 
49tc0402 The disallowance of passive losses is being phased in over five years 
49tc0403 Real estate depreciation schedules also have been lengthened reducing their value 
49tc0404 While the U\. S\. focuses on the Iran Contra hearings more Soviet arms flow into Nicaragua 
49tc0405 More than three hundred million worth of weapons were delivered to the Sandinistas in the first half of this year according to U\. S\. intelligence 
49tc0406 That\'s about nine times the direct U\. S\. military aid provided to the Contras in that period 
49tc0407 The Soviet equipment is just pouring in one ranking Pentagon official told the A\. P\.

49tc040b But at least the market didn\'t crash 
49tc040c Citicorp\'s loss for the year stemmed from a three billion dollar addition in the second quarter to loss reserves for loans to developing countries 
49tc040d Excluding one time gains and losses Citicorp\'s nineteen eighty seven profit would have been one \.POINT one five billion 
49tc040e Excluded are gains on real estate in the fourth quarter and pension assets in the third quarter plus the effect of the reserve addition

49tc040n When the market goes down stop orders appear like crazy he says

49uc0204 Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value 
49uc0205 Thus higher bidding narrows the investor\'s return while lower bidding widens it 
49uc0206 The percentage rates are calculated on a three hundred and sixty day year while the coupon equivalent yield is based on a three hundred and sixty five day year 
49uc0207 The lastest disclosures are an outgrowth of that probe 
49uc0208 Already the Department of Transportation has accused Delta Airlines and Eastern Airlines of engaging in unrealistic scheduling at Atlanta\'s Hartsfield Airport 
49uc0209 The carriers deny this but the government has expanded its probe 
49uc020a It has asked several other airlines to turn over their on time records at Dallas Fort Worth Chicago\'s O\'Hare and Boston\'s Logan airports 
49uc020b It was a wonderful day for the bond markets said Michael J\. Connery a senior vice president of financial futures at Chicago based Refco Incorporated 
49uc020c All the apparent signs of inflation were deflated 
49uc020d And that\'s led to a tremendous amount of short covering or traders and investors buying back securities that they borrowed and sold 
49uc020e Still whatever the risk of garbage burning the alternative landfill is worse says Mr\. McManus the publisher of Resource Recovery Report

49uc0211 Off the hook The resignation of Justice Department criminal division chief Weld erases Rhode Island Representative Saint Germain\'s risk of indictment for taking meals from lobbyists 
49uc0212 Agency lawyers who ran a grand jury investigation urged no action citing House rules allowing nearly unlimited entertainment 
49uc0213 Weld was reluctant to drop the case 
49uc0214 Robert Ravitz a Grey senior vice president says the agency did the best it could based on drawings of the coin 
49uc0215 Responding to Miss Jones\'s comments he says I don\'t know what her problem is with the artwork

49uc0218 So far the administration has ignored these appeals and so have Mr\. Reed and other bankers 
49uc0219 It seems that principles enunciated at the beginning of this decade by Messrs\. 
49uc021a Wriston and Theobald still prevail if not in lending the bank\'s money at least in suggesting that other investors put up the cash 
49uc021b But experience shows that once an upscale product puts its name on lower priced goods it can never go back up 
49uc021c Revlon Group Incorporated for example is making a long shot attempt to rekindle the Halston flame 
49uc021d Revlon owner of Halston Enterprises Incorporated has visions of seeing Halston label clothes back in better dress departments 
49uc021e But marketers believe the company has a credibility problem after its six year association with retailer J\. C\. Penney Company which ended last year 
49uc0301 But when L\. B\. O\. companies sell stock the big winners usually are a tight circle of executives and investment bankers who earlier bought control 
49uc0302 Profits often exceed ten times these investors\' original stake 
49uc0303 These giant concentrated payoffs from L\. B\. O\.s are starting to anger mainstream investors and worry academics 
49uc0304 It\'s inconceivable that the directorate didn\'t know about Mr\. Rodriguez comments one international human rights worker who has studied the local refugee situation 
49uc0305 The people of El Barillo are under the boot 
49uc0306 They\'ve been smart enough to survive 
49uc0307 They\'ve adapted 
49uc0308 The new tax law\'s limits on retirement benefits for executives spur greater interest in certain trusts that help safeguard deferred compensation until retirement time 
49uc0309 Such trusts aren\'t completely inviolate creditors can claim the money after a bankruptcy for instance 
49uc030a But they are considered better than a mere promise to the executive 
49uc030b The drug azidothymidine or A\. Z\. T\. is the first prescription drug for acquired immune deficiency syndrome to get federal Food and Drug Administration approval 
49uc030c A\. Z\. T\. is marketed under the name Retrovir by Burroughs Wellcome Company at an annual retail dosage cost of about ten thousand dollars 
49uc030d It also is the most expensive prescription drug prompting fears that some insurers who normally provide prescription drug coverage will balk at its price 
49uc030e Now the issue is in the House\'s lap 
49uc030f The temporary ban on new banking powers is a provision in the Senate version of a bill to recapitalize the insolvent Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation 
49uc030g The House F\. S\. L\. I\. C\. measure doesn\'t have any other provisions 
49uc030h In addition by consenting to Rorer\'s bid Robins may have put itself up for sale 
49uc030i The whole thing could still deteriorate into an auction said a lawyer who was involved in the Manville Corporation bankruptcy law case 
49uc030j Other bidders could come in 
49uc030k Californians were asked how the state should get rid of its hefty budget surplus now estimated at one \.POINT one billion dollars 
49uc030l By a two to one margin registered Democrats surveyed by the Field Institute favored giving the money to public schools 
49uc030m But the state constitution may require the money to be returned directly to taxpayers 
49uc030n That appears more in line with Republican thinking

49uc030p Harry Truman whistle stopped the country in nineteen forty eight campaigning against a parochial do nothing Congress that would not enact his legislative program 
49uc030q He struck a chord in the American people not only winning a stunning upset but also defeating scores of Republican congressmen in the process 
49uc030r Truman recognized that a presidential contest is not just a race among candidates but also an opportunity to debate great issues such as the proper separation of powers 
49uc030s The contest then isn\'t ideological 
49uc030t It\'s character personality experience 
49uc030u It\'s cultural as much as anything else 
49uc030v President Reagan who was in Durham North Carolina was cautious about the Soviet offer 
49uc030w I\'m waiting to see what the conditions are he said 
49uc030x A senior administration official however called the Gorbachev statement a watershed event because it will increase expectations among Soviet people for withdrawal 
49uc030y Completion of the transaction which also requires approval by regulatory agencies and holders of other securities must be completed no later than November thirtieth under the agreement 
49uc030z If it doesn\'t close as expected by September thirtieth the cash price paid by Nova for each Polysar common share would rise ten Canadian cents

49uc0311 Transamerica said its consumer lending business achieved record results in the quarter with consumer loans secured by real estate growing to two \.POINT five billion dollars 
49uc0312 Its leasing business also posted record results 
49uc0313 Demand for standard containers was high because of strong world trade Transamerica said 
49uc0314 However the San Francisco based company said its real estate operations reported lower earnings 
49uc0315 That leaves the option of a military strike at terrorists or their bases which are mainly in Lebanon\'s Bekaa Valley an area under Syrian control 
49uc0316 U\. S\. intelligence agencies have identified as potential targets there buildings known to have been used by Hezbollah forces and their mentors the Iranian Revolutionary Guards 
49uc0317 But they aren\'t certain which factions use which buildings or when they are present 
49uc0318 Quite possibly a recent profit sharing bonus helped 
49uc0319 We don\'t have an elegant formula says Mr\. Barron 
49uc031a We said we think everyone\'s entitled to a share so here\'s a check 
49uc031b Next year if we do well there may be a bigger check 
49uc031c Is this any way to run a railroad 
49uc031d Could be 
49uc031e Consumers may also be worried about whether auto makers will continue the generous incentives they\'ve used almost continuously over the past year to buoy sales 
49uc031f What\'s happening here is the good old buy in advance syndrome said John Qualls of Micro Economics Limited in Saint Louis 
49uc031g Mr\. Qualls expects sales to sag badly in the fourth quarter causing supplies of unsold vehicles to rise unless auto makers show continued restraint in production 
49uc0401 The Iranian crisis and the administration\'s uncertain grip on it has reawakened this cynicism 
49uc0402 The polls show much of the public does not believe the president when he denies knowing that profits from Iranian arms sales had been used to aid the contras 
49uc0403 On this the matter is likely to turn 
49uc0404 Not on whether the shipments were a good idea or on whether lawyers can find some law that has been broken 
49uc0405 But on whether President Reagan told the truth when he denied knowing 
49uc0406 Interco said that because of the definitive agreement its Interco Subsidiary Incorporated unit terminated its tender offer for all Lane common shares at fifty five dollars a share 
49uc0407 The offer was set to expire Monday 
49uc0408 Any shares tendered to Interco under the offer will be returned to Lane shareholders Interco said 
49uc0409 Nevertheless First Options still lets customers such as James F\. Hart trade in naked out of the money puts and calls

49uc040b Other brokerage firms however have curbed or halted unhedged options trading since the crash 
49uc040c Pet owners often call a pet psychic because a pet is sick and they want a detailed account of how it\'s feeling 
49uc040d And some pet psychics claim they can chat with pets from a distance 
49uc040e For example Gay Travers a former publicist called pet psychic Penelope Smith when her cat Sebastian was very ill 
49uc040f Ms\. Smith told her to hang up while the psychic talked to Sebastian 
49uc040g Three minutes later she called back with some bad news 
49uc040h Does that mean a cabinet post

49uc040q It\'s a welcome development in the face of very significant inventory overhang says Morgan Stanley\'s Mr\. Roach 
49uc040r A slowing of growth in production gives companies the ability to work off some inventory

49uc040z As for principal transactions Wall Street\'s euphemism for trigger happy trading it\'s a bit harder to gauge the risks 
49uc0410 The firm is a big government bond trader and has grown a lot in foreign currency trading 
49uc0411 And among Morgan Stanley\'s biggest percentage gains in nineteen eighty seven was equity principal transactions which nearly tripled to two hundred fifty nine million dollars in revenue 
49uc0412 It\'s pretty reasonable for people to take a dive on this one he says 
49uc0413 I\'m a little scared 
49uc0414 I don\'t blame people for not being heroes

49uc041d Kemper Financial Services\' David Hale refers to a soft takeoff 
49uc041e The latest data fuel Fed worries about reigniting inflation 
49vc0201 The delay is a victory albeit temporary for Mr\. Trump who owns two Atlantic City casino hotels 
49vc0202 Bally\'s agreement to buy the Golden Nugget is widely perceived as an effort to scuttle a takeover attempt by Mr\. Trump 
49vc0203 Mr\. Trump\'s demand that the Golden Nugget purchase be blocked came as part of a countersuit he filed against Bally in December challenging a Bally financial restructuring plan 
49vc0204 Bally had earlier sued Mr\. Trump alleging various securities law violations 
49vc0205 The outlook in the Senate is still cloudy as long as President Reagan continues to oppose a tax boost 
49vc0206 [tongue_click] Still Senate budget writers are including a significant revenue increase in their deficit reduction package

49vc0209 So our William McGurn inquired into how many have been exported from Korea to Japan 
49vc020a He found that in nineteen eighty six the number was zero 
49vc020b This was down from nineteen eighty five when exports reached one sold to Mitsubishi 
49vc020c Exports lost to tougher competition abroad and more imports into the United States market have caused many farmers to abandon their traditional faith in free trade 
49vc020d From sugar long protected to wheat to flowers farmers are demanding that borders be closed 
49vc020e The losers particularly in sugar are many of the Latin American countries whose desperate economies the United States government is otherwise trying to salvage

49vc020h Overall August outlays were one \.POINT one \%PERCENT above a year earlier 
49vc020i The huge gap to a large extent is a price phenomenon 
49vc020j The dollar\'s fall has pushed up the price of imports causing the deficit to swell even as the volume of non oil imports has receded

49vc020x The piper has to be paid on the other side 
49vc020y Mr\. Perot told Texas officials last month that his new company would bid against E\. D\. S\. to process about eight million dollars a year in Medicaid claims 
49vc020z Thus Mr\. Perot put into play a contract that E\. D\. S\. has held exclusively since nineteen seventy seven

49vc0213 They received payments in cash and in the form of clothes club memberships and payment of personal bills according to the charges 
49vc0214 N\. B\. C\.\'s T\. V\. coverage also gets its share of the blame 
49vc0215 Marketers say that it was so bland and skipped so frequently from one event to another that there was little chance for excitement to build 
49vc0216 The constant commercial interruptions which led to ratings that were much lower than expected didn\'t help either 
49vc0217 The rehabilitation process is certainly further along

49vc0301 Any such agreement between the airlines and airport operators could be written into the congressional legislation reauthorizing the aviation trust fund 
49vc0302 The trust fund which is financed by ticket and fuel taxes helps pay for F\. A\. A\. operations and provides grants to airports 
49vc0303 Some have suggested that airport operators as a condition of accepting the grants agree to give up some authority in making noise rules 
49vc0304 Raytheon denied that it\'s freely giving away jobs 
49vc0305 We aren\'t crazy about offsets but we\'d enter into them as a compromise business arrangement if it\'s the best that\'s available said Raytheon spokesman Lawrence McCracken

49vc030a Floating fails when governments try to escape from the verdict of the exchange markets on their policies by resorting to direct controls over trade and capital flows 
49vc030b Because this latter threat is now so severe the world is right to talk about international monetary reform if only as a delaying game 
49vc030c But idealistic talk should not deceive stabilizing exchange rates requires dependence and subordination not the freedom for everybody to do their own thing 
49vc030d There\'s been a complete turnaround in short term sentiment said Thomas G\. Gribbon a senior vice president at Nomura Securities International Inc\.

49vc030o The country has refused to sign the nuclear non proliferation treaty unless rival India which exploded its first nuclear device in nineteen seventy four does so 
49vc030p Pakistan has proposed various non proliferation controls on its program but only if India agrees to the same controls 
49vc030q Yesterday people close to Federated\'s board said that the company was still open to yet another friendly merger proposal from Campeau

49vc030w It\'s not going to cost them a thing 
49vc030x His inability to recover from October\'s market plunge was traced to a hostile bid from two rival financiers for Bell Resources Limited which is controlled by Bell Group 
49vc030y The bid forced Mr\. Holmes a Court to call off a proposed merger of the Bell companies 
49vc030z That was the turning point said Darryl Smalley a director at the Perth brokerage Hartley Poynton Limited 
49vc0310 Frankfurt share prices retreated across the board in moderately active trading as the day earlier decline on Wall Street and weaker dollar prompted widespread profit taking 
49vc0311 But equities recovered some of their earlier losses late in the session and most prices closed only slightly lower 
49vc0312 The market\'s bullish momentum is still intact traders said citing a flurry of late buy orders 
49vc0313 At the center of the controversy is a proposed sixth nuclear plant near Basel at Kaiseraugst a former Roman settlement on the Rhine 
49vc0314 In March a group of parliamentarians who had strongly supported the facility astonished the country by proposing the government abandon it 
49vc0315 Some one \.POINT two billion Swiss francs eight hundred and thirty four \.POINT two million dollars had already been spent on the project 
49vc0316 What bothers these people is not that Mrs\. Thatcher poses a danger to the so called unified European market 
49vc0317 Mrs\. Thatcher is not opposed to this 
49vc0318 Britain\'s own markets are more open than those of most European countries London is way ahead of them on capital movement having abolished exchange controls altogether 
49vc0319 The cause of the outrage is that European unity is the device through which the regulators and socialists hope to expand their grip on the Continent 
49vc031a Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value 
49vc031b Thus higher bidding narrows the investor\'s return while lower bidding widens it

49wc020b Not long ago Tenneco was considered an unlikely restructuring candidate 
49wc020c Its heavy debts and depressed energy and farm equipment businesses made it appear immune to raiders 
49wc020d But the company\'s improving business prospects and asset values have changed that 
49wc020e In your article you noted that a company\'s history often just walks out the door when key employees retire or move on to other jobs 
49wc020f The firms we have worked with have all been determined to avoid this form of corporate amnesia 
49wc020g Although not all of our clients have extensive archives they have all recognized the value of having a corporate oral history program 
49wc020h Unfair or not the questions have been asked about both the revolution\'s route and its goals How much violence will there be

49wc0217 The inescapable fact however [loud_breath] is that one day the water is going to run out or become too expensive to pump up 
49wc0218 We\'re going to see less production 
49wc0219 There\'s no way around it says Kansas State extension economist Mark Nelson 
49wc021a But it\'s not going to be a cataclysmic thing 
49wc021b For foreign securities firms as with any business here patience is a key to success 
49wc021c Most of those succeeding have stuck it out through deficits 
49wc021d Merrill Lynch was the first foreign firm to set up shop in Japan in nineteen sixty one and it says *longevity* pays big dividends 
49wc021e It is the foreign securities firm that is the most widely recognized by Japanese investors 
49wc021f With retail offices in five Japanese cities Merrill Lynch is the only foreign firm that earns significant profits from its retail and private client businesses 
49wc021g It wasn\'t always easy but it\'s worked out very well for us says Randy Harris the firm\'s president in Japan 
49wc0301 The auto maker says the wagon version of the Medallion will have a base price of ten thousand six hundred and ninety three dollars

49wc0304 J\. Walter Thompson will retain Ford\'s U\. S\. car and truck accounts for which it created the *ubiquitous* Have you driven a Ford lately campaign 
49wc0305 It also will retain smaller Ford accounts in six other countries and it continues to be Ford\'s largest agency 
49wc0306 But industry sources say they believe Ford was considering giving one of those six accounts for Ford\'s Latin American affiliate to another agency 
49wc0307 Indeed within days of its re election Mr\. Hawke\'s government has announced wholesale changes in the Australian Public Service 
49wc0308 The existing structure will be rationalized and the number of departments reduced from twenty seven to seventeen 
49wc0309 Mr\. Hawke and Mr\. Keating now are preparing for the sale of government assets on a grand scale 
49wc030a Signs of change are everywhere 
49wc030b Although few firms admit to staff cuts many are quietly pruning their ranks 
49wc030c Many have shift their specialists in tax exempt housing bonds where activity is particularly low to their mortgage backed bond operations 
49wc030d Doug is much more aggressive in the marketplace says James E\. Sorenson Battelle\'s senior vice president for manufacturing 
49wc030e He gets out and has one on one meetings with chief executives of companies and learns where the market is going 
49wc030f Battelle must anticipate commercial demand five to eight years ahead Mr\. Sorenson adds 
49wc030g Kemp\'s campaign takes on an increasingly desperate tone 
49wc030h In one sure sign of a candidacy in trouble he lashes out at a criticism from a lightly regarded T\. V\. commentator 
49wc030i Even some supporters now say privately that he should aim for the vice presidential nomination 
49wc030j But his longtime hostilities with *Dole* leave a spot on a Bush ticket as about the only possibility 
49wc030k Professional corporations 
49wc030l Taxes would go up for corporations consisting of lawyers doctors accountants and architects 
49wc030m The provision would eliminate graduated rates for these personal service corporations so that they all would pay the flat thirty four corporate rate

49wc030o Mr\. Ng formerly was deputy chairman of United Overseas Bank the second largest bank holding company in Singapore 
49wc030p It hasn\'t been charged with any wrongdoing 
49wc030q I have no doubt though that the trust of Fed policy will be more towards ease than restraint Mr\. Robertson adds 
49wc030r Fed officials will be much more inclined to err on the side of ease 
49wc030s So I think the fed funds rate will be at six \.POINT five \%PERCENT to six \.POINT seven five \%PERCENT for the next sixty days 
49wc030t The Federal Reserve Board addressed the issue in Banca Commerciale\'s purchase of Long Island Trust Company in nineteen eighty two 
49wc030u The Fed approved the purchase as it has cleared several similar transactions involving smaller banks bought by government controlled foreign interests in the past 
49wc030v The Fed approval took fifteen months and the board served notice that the Long Island Trust case involved significant and complex problems 
49wc030w It added that more extensive analysis and broader participation are needed to resolve public policy issues 
49wc030x In an unlikely twist current farm law may force him to return money he has already received from the government 
49wc030y He got a four thousand dollar check in the spring as an advance on the price support subsidies he was promised for his fall crop 
49wc030z But now that the prices have gone up so sharply he may no longer qualify for the subsidy 
49wc0310 In that event he may not just have to return his spring check but also wouldn\'t be eligible for the usual post harvest money 
49wc0311 For the nineteen eighty seven third quarter the magazine group had pretax earnings of six \.POINT two million dollars on revenue of fifty nine \.POINT five million dollars 
49wc0312 The expected earnings drop reflects one fewer issue in the quarter of Family Circle

49wc031b On August twenty third the U\. S\. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia upheld the Comptroller of the Currency\'s approval of the purchase of the insurance company 
49wc031c The Comptroller had found that multiple bond insurance is functional the same as banks\' standby letters of credit 
49wc031d However the court said that Citicorp needed the Fed\'s permission as well as the Comptroller\'s to make the acquisition 
49wc0401 The operating rate is still kind of low but it\'s coming back said Priscilla Luce senior economist at Wharton *Econometric* Forecasting Associates in Philadelphia 
49wc0402 There is still some cause for optimism 
49wc0403 She said export gains have spurred some of the improvement 
49wc0404 In Cleveland Higbee chief executive officer Robert Boardbent says the retailer has benefited from its parent\'s financial expertise 
49wc0405 Although it will retain control Industrial Equity is planning to take Higbee public again probably in June 
49wc0406 Meanwhile says Mr\. Boardbent They\'ve made us more inquisitive about acquisitions ourselves 
49wc0407 Still he would prefer there be no bids at all 
49wc0408 The company\'s policy for eighty five years has been to be independent and grow and we have succeeded he says 
49wc0409 We are evaluating the offers for the company and for the shareholders but we profoundly regret the situation 
49wc040a Meanwhile the agency said it will conduct a study on its own 
49wc040b Officials said the review may lead to new regulations for data processing systems 
49wc040c The agency may also challenge past charges to the Pentagon 
49wc040d Pentagon officials say the review likely will take at least a year 
49wc040e The government civil suit alleged that a defect could cause the rear brakes to lock sending the car spinning out of control

49wc040q Mr\. Poehl listed several reasons for the dollar\'s improved prospects 
49wc040r American exports have done real well in real terms he explained I think that\'s going to continue 
49wc040s At the same time imports by Japan and Europe especially West Germany have been speeding up 
49wc040t These trends he said are redressing the trade imbalances that helped provoke the dollar\'s fall 
49wc040u I don\'t want to be *euphoric* you know but I think it\'s under way 
49wc040v Mr\. Poehl added

49wc040z BankAmerica officials hope that like the earlier problems the improving finances will feed on themselves 
49wc0410 It is counting on a stronger credit rating to allow it to become more than a minor leaguer in pitching lucrative interest rate and currency swaps 
49wc0411 Money to promote a flagging global corporate computer service is becoming available 
49wc0412 So is support for a beefed up team of deal makers to broker mergers among California companies 
49wc0413 None of these areas however hold the prospect of quick growth 
49wc0414 Prices of some actively traded thirty year bonds rose quarter a point or two dollars and fifty cents for each one thousand dollar face amount 
49wc0415 The yield hovered at nine \.POINT oh three \%PERCENT

49wc0417 Suez which had to raise its capital *several* times last year through rights issues to fund its Belgian battle says it can fund its acquisition to Cie 
49wc0418 Industrielle out of its cash hoard or through short term loans 
49wc0419 One source said Suez if victorious would likely resell part of its stake in Cie

49wc041b It could also sell off Cie 
49wc041c Industrielle assets such as real estate and minority industrial holdings estimated at between one billion and two billion francs 
49wc041d Airlines say airspace has become so crowded in Europe that any airline missing an assigned takeoff slot may have to wait an hour for another free slot 
49wc041e Each country in Europe also operates its own air traffic control system and this makes the entire European air system vulnerable to the continent\'s frequent air controller strikes 
49wc041f Two weeks ago for instance a weekend strike by engineers who control airplanes in flight over France caused horrendous backups on British flights heading through French airspace 
49xc0201 Payoffs to Moscow by the West could range from f- softening human rights policies to extending cheap loans to relaxing technology controls 
49xc0202 The available Soviet instruments include its North Sea navy its mobile armored forces in Central Europe and its array of conventionally armed tactical missiles 
49xc0203 Whether such blackmail would ever be sensible or possible is arguable but officials like Mr\. Abshire don\'t want Moscow to have the ability to try 
49xc0204 Here are price trends on the m- world\'s major stock markets as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International *Perspective* Geneva 
49xc0205 To make them directly comparable each index is based on the close of nineteen sixty nine equaling one hundred

49xc0208 The chief opposition party the Reunification and Democracy Party led by Kim Young Sam has vowed it won\'t participate in any election under the current constitution 
49xc0209 It and the Co- National Coalition for a Democratic Constitution a newly formed alliance of religious and dissident groups are organizing tomorrow\'s opposition rallies 
49xc020a Now the issue is in the House\'s lap 
49xc020b The temporary ban on new banking powers is a provision in the Senate version of a bill to recapitalize the insolvent Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation 
49xc020c The House F\. S\. L\. I\. C\. measure doesn\'t have any other provisions 
49xc020d Mr\. Reagan\'s comments don\'t reflect any change in his ip- interpretation of the deficit reduction agreement 
49xc020e At the insistence of the White House the plan specifically noted that the president could either sign or veto the specific taxes Congress chooses 
49xc020f And the administration has said before that it isn\'t happy with the provision on takeovers 
49xc020g Even before Mr\. Gardini\'s bid for the chairmanship Montedison executives had said they would consider selective divestments of non strategic companies

49xc020t The government is now poring over Mr\. Seow\'s financial affairs asking how he\'s been paying his phone bills these past ten years 
49xc020u Similar inquiries led to the expulsion from Parliament last December of Joshua B\. Jeyaretnam leaving only one opposition M\. P\. 
49xc020v A team candidate proposal now under study would also seem likely to keep the opposition from finding its way into government office 
49xc020w But Singapore\'s two \.POINT six million citizens aren\'t likely to benefit quite so much as the politicians of Mr\. Lee\'s ruling party 
49xc020x Indeed no changes are likely soon because the wholesalers and small retailers that benefit from the existing system are well organized backers of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party 
49xc020y The Japanese debate on the distribution system began only recently 
49xc020z Even after a consensus is reached new legislation may have to be drafted and enacted

49xc0213 Scientists in general must come to terms with their reliance on Congress for financial support 
49xc0214 Space scientists now compete for attention with other big science projects <as> such as mapping the human genome or the super collider

49xc030m The complex plan gradually gives the company to the debt holders said Charles E\. Bayless financial vice president 
49xc030n In contrast if the utility began bankruptcy proceedings they the debt holders would get it right now he said

49xc0310 It is all a president can do to keep up with events time for reflection is a luxury beyond reach 
49xc0311 Nor is there time for a president to learn much beyond the knowledge with which he comes to office 
49xc0312 That\'s worth remembering when we think not about nineteen ninety nine but about nineteen eighty eight

49xc040q Then last February he was contacted by Martin Sorrell chairman of W\. P\. P\. the British marketing services concern 
49xc040r What remains for history to judge is first how well he succeeded 
49xc040s Here the judgment may be mixed 
49xc040t We do have less taxes and less inflation but bigger spending and as much government as before 
49xc040u History\'s second judgment will be whether his years represent a mere passing change or whether the change will endure

49xc0415 As previously reported Black and Decker has countered American Standard\'s rights plan by seeking shareholders\' consent to take control of American Standard\'s board 
49xc0416 The maneuver is similar to a proxy fight but doesn\'t require a shareholder meeting

49xc0419 Tobacco companies have the right to market their product he says his voice rising and his party manners wearing thin

49yc020v Who\'s right 
49yc020w In some respects they all are but the blame doesn\'t rest on OSHA\'s shoulders alone 
49yc020x The agency has come under fire for doing too much or too little from the day its doors opened on Constitution Avenue seventeen years ago 
49yc020y The reality is that OSHA\'s effectiveness has been pinched by budget and staff cuts and its grasp on business loosened by the Reagan administration\'s deregulatory shock troops 
49yc020z South Africa Angola and Cuba ended a round of peace talks without an agreement or a date to meet again 
49yc0210 But sources said the discussions which involve Namibian independence and peace in Angola have made progress

49yc0212 Mr\. Minoli the U\. S\. general manager says Benetton recently dropped its strategy of saturating the market with small stores 
49yc0213 Now it is concentrating on professionalism and the servicing of existing stores he says 
49yc0214 New stores will be larger outlets called United Colors that will offer a much broader range of merchandise 
49yc0215 Benetton plans to have ten United Colors shops operating in the U\. S\. by next spring 
49yc0216 Mr\. Minoli also estimates that as many as one hundred smaller Benetton stores may close in the next five years 
49yc0217 But it\'s what this election is all about 
49yc0218 The real question on the ballot is Should the Reagan Years continue beyond the Reagan years 
49yc0219 Beyond the Bush years 
49yc021a Beyond even the Quayle years 
49yc021b The Supreme Court will determine that and the next president will determine the court\'s makeup for at least another generation

49yc0308 The Japanese electronics concern is affected by the U\. S\.\'s newly imposed duties on certain products according to an official at Nikko Securities Company which led the issue 
49yc0309 But it isn\'t clear how large the impact will be 
49yc030a Most of the loan would be used to reimburse public and private importers for goods they would import and then incorporate into products that could be exported 
49yc030b The loan would be for fifteen years including three years of grace and carry a variable interest rate tied to the bank\'s borrowing costs 
49yc030c The rate currently stands at seven \.POINT nine two \%PERCENT 
49yc030d Obviously I have to tell my people Do you know how much harm you\'re doing to yourself by making products of insufficient quality

49yc030w Its shareholders include some of the nation\'s largest pension funds 
49yc030x C\. P\. I\. isn\'t involved in the litigation but some of its shareholders would undoubtedly love to slow down the activity in leveraged takeovers 
49yc030y The U\. S\. bond market meanwhile continues to struggle with two persistent problems 
49yc030z The U\. S\. trade deficit creates pressure for a lower dollar 
49yc0310 The threat of rising inflation becomes greater as the dollar weakens and as capacity constraints associated with the late stage of an economic boom push up wages and prices 
49yc0311 But some argue Agenda could be a big hit and create a new category of software 
49yc0312 This is fundamentally new and different 
49yc0313 It\'s tremendously exciting says Esther Dyson editor of Release one \.POINT oh a newsletter that covers computer software 
49yc0314 I think it\'s an extremely useful tool says Mort Rosenthal chairman of Corporate Software Incorporated a Westwood Massachusetts based software distributor

49yc0316 Estimates of the makeup of the feedlot population vary widely 
49yc0317 Most analysts expect the government to report that the number of young cattle placed on feedlots fell in July for the second consecutive month from a year earlier 
49yc0318 However some expect a rise 
49yc0319 A simpler way to reduce bank debts that is more advantageous to borrowers are straight buy backs in the growing secondary loan market 
49yc031a Buy backs helped clear up Latin American debt problems in the late nineteen thirties

49yc0407 The opposition is already rolling 
49yc0408 Many of the pressure groups that campaigned unsuccessfully against Mr\. Reagan in two presidential campaigns seem to regard this battle as their Armageddon 
49yc0409 Teddy Kennedy himself has testified that Judge Bork\'s appearance means the end is near 
49yc040a If Ronald Reagan wants Robert Bork confirmed he will have to create an alternative choice to the one [loud_breath] . these groups are trying to force on undecided senators 
49yc040b That means Mr\. Reagan has to explain clearly why American society will benefit if judges such as Robert Bork apply the law in a neutral manner 
49yc040c He will have to point out why many of the long held grievances of the electorate result <when> un- when unelected judges manufacture new laws 
49yc040d Certainly foreign competition and a changing world economy have exacted a heavy toll on our nation\'s manufacturing industries 
49yc040e However many of these industries have survived and are now as tough and lean as they\'ve ever been 
49yc040f The managers of these companies have learned through hard experience about exactly which investments pay off 
49yc040g Interestingly enough some Democrats are warming to the idea 
49yc040h Privatization often is simply good management sense

49zc0202 With the change of government last year a mild improvement in military behavior and the detection of the Mindanao slaughters some Filipinos are changing their minds

49zc021b It was inadvertent 
49zc021c S\. and P\'s event risk covenant rankings which were started last month have five categories 
49zc021d [tongue_click] E\. three stands midway 
49zc021e Traders have said the Bowater bonds was the best received deal in the past two sessions because of a strong investor demand for event risk protection 
49zc0301 Contra leaders say they look forward to the military challenge 
49zc0302 It\'s in our ballpark says Carlos Ulvert the Contra foreign secretary 
49zc0303 He and other Contras assert that congressional stinginess until this year kept the *Contras* from picking up steam on the battlefield 
49zc0304 Mr\. *Ulvert* adds If we\'re going to have ten thousand men in Nicaragua better trained and better supplied their military presence is going to be felt 
49zc0305 For investors the partnerships are only as attractive as the underlying buyouts 
49zc0306 [tongue_click] Many in the field contend that the buyouts being put together these days are generally overpriced because of several factors 
49zc0307 Among them too much capital chasing too few good candidates which has pushed costs up and returns down to what they see as unacceptable levels 
49zc0308 Now two hundred and fifty boxes dating back to nineteen oh nine are on display beneath track lighting in a special room in his house 
49zc0309 More than three hundred fifty other boxes are in the garage 
49zc030a They are of a more recent vintage and Mr\. Cook is waiting for them to appreciate in value 
49zc030b General Secord said he was stunned to learn that day of Admiral Poindexter\'s resignation and Colonel North\'s firing 
49zc030c Besieged by calls from the press he said he went to a hotel near his office 
49zc030d He said Colonel North met him there and received phone calls from President Reagan and Vice President George Bush thanking him for his contributions to the government 
49zc030e The improved results stem largely from gold sales at the company\'s Gold Bar operations in Nevada where production began in January 
49zc030f We think we <can> c- can sustain production of forty five thousand to fifty thousand ounces annually for at least ten years Mr\. Weaver said in an interview 
49zc030g Atlas also controls about fifty thousand acres contiguous to Gold Bar and exploration efforts are being expanded 
49zc030h Dayton Hudson may get some things it didn\'t request from the Minnesota legislature 
49zc030i Some political leaders are discussing whether to amend the Dayton Hudson proposal to ban such controversial management takeovers as golden parachutes poison pills and greenmail payments 
49zc030j This is a two way street said Michael Hatch commissioner of the Minnesota Commerce Department 
49zc030k Managements shouldn\'t be entrenched 
49zc030l Inacomp Computer Centers Inc\. announced the offering of one million seven hundred fifty thousand sh- common shares at eight dollars \.POINT three seven five cents each 
49zc030m The Troy Michigan based marketer of microcomputers and related products said the proceeds will be used to repay debt 
49zc030n Salomon Brothers Inc\. is the lead underwriter 
49zc030o Inacomp said the underwriters have been granted an overallotment option to purchase as many as an additional two hundred sixty two thousand five hundred shares 
49zc030p In over the counter trading yesterday the company\'s shares closed at eight dollars twenty five cents down twelve \.POINT five cents 
49zc030q The union said the workers\' complaints persuaded it to place a team of organizers in Smyrna last July 
49zc030r It has started collecting support cards from employees and if thirty \%PERCENT of the plant\'s thirty two hundred workers sign up the union can request an election 
49zc030s Mr\. Bieber said the union hasn\'t set a deadline to complete the drive 
49zc030t After collecting the signatures the U\. A\. W\. can ask Nissan to recognize the union without an election although acquiescence by Nissan isn\'t considered likely 
49zc030u To punish currency speculators the government is allowing people to exchange a maximum of ten million old cordobas 
49zc030v Anything over that can\'t be exchanged but must be deposited in a bank account 
49zc030w The moves took effect yesterday 
49zc030x NATO leaders ended a two day summit in Brussels 
49zc030y The alliance issued a communique that stressed its determination to decide on a comprehensive approach to further arms control treaties 
49zc030z But it sidestepped decisions on divisive issues such as modernizing the short range nuclear weapons based in West Germany 
49zc0310 That growth came in response to a decline in interest rates during the second half which prompted a flood of mortgage applications 
49zc0311 It also reflected government measures to [door_slam] stimulate domestic spending 
49zc0312 The housing boom in turn triggered heavy consumer spending on household goods which aided the strong second half economic expansion 
49zc0313 Inflation adjusted gross national product grew two \%PERCENT in the third quarter <from> from the prior three months and one \.POINT seven \%PERCENT in the fourth quarter 
49zc0314 Mr\. Bregman said in an interview that Mr\. Gillet te- telephoned him Friday with thirty two dollars a share offer for the partnership\'s stock 
49zc0315 He said he declined because the offer was too low and because it wasn\'t being made to other holders 
49zc0316 The letter filed yesterday said the partnership wouldn\'t consider greenmail proposals 
49zc0317 Greenmail refers to a company\'s buying back stock at a higher than market price 
49zc0318 According to an attorney in the case Microsoft and Hewlett Packard previously rejected an informal attempt by Apple to change judges 
49zc0319 Yesterday a Microsoft spokesman declined comment 
49zc031a A Hewlett Packard spokesman said We see no reason why the judge should disqualify himself 
49zc031b I don\'t see any difference between the Bausch and Lomb case and the Apple case 
49zc031c Now stung by the recent debt laden takeovers some fund managers are planning to dump industrial bonds 
49zc031d Others will reduce their exposure to them 
49zc031e What many are buying instead bonds issued by utilities banks and foreign companies those with the least chance of being bought out 
49zc031f Others are buying safer Treasury bonds whose yields are a percentage or less below top grade industrial debt 
49zc0401 And with all the different groups waving the competitiveness flag won\'t the argument get a little shopworn 
49zc0402 Says Mr\. Kay If you are serious about improving U\. S\. competitiveness one of the essential elements has to be research and development 
49zc0403 But yes to the extent this town becomes cynical about competitiveness being used to cover everything on four legs it will hurt us 
49zc0404 By and large OPEC is prepared to sit it out said a senior OPEC minister who asked not to be identified 
49zc0405 There may be some weaker members among us but OPEC as a whole isn\'t overproducing 
49zc0406 [loud_breath] The problem is speculation by traders that verges on psychological warfare 
49zc0407 [loud_breath] Publishing so called backlist books that are kept in print for years on end has some advantages over publishing best sellers 
49zc0408 A good fishing book will never match a Jackie Collins novel in total sales 
49zc0409 But it will outlive her racy fiction with its fickle readers 
49zc040a Publishers will dump most of this year\'s best sellers on remainder tables next year where they may fetch as little as a dollar apiece 
49zc040b Congress gave the space agency\'s plan mixed reviews 
49zc040c Representative Bill Lowery Republican California who has been outspoken about the importance of securing a second booster rocket supplier praised the plan 
49zc040d Competition fuels excellence he said and this is the first step toward a solid rocket motor with better safety precautions and more efficient production

49zc040f The Financial Times thirty share index rose eleven \.POINT six to seventeen seventy five \.POINT four 
49zc040g The gold mines index fell three \.POINT five to four forty nine \.POINT five 
49zc040h Volume was light at four hundred fifty four \.POINT six million shares compared with seven hundred fifty one \.POINT four million Friday 
49zc040i I was surprised at how well the scents have done on the market said Thomas Conley executive vice president of the American Fishing Tackle Manufacturers Association 
49zc040j But then again any time you get a product that calls attention to fishing it\'s good as a whole 
49zc040k Some call whatever it is a gimmick while others say it\'s the best thing since the rod and reel 
49zc040l Either way it gets people to try it 
49zc040m Moreover Mr\. Sawyer isn\'t thought to possess a lot of clout 
49zc040n He doesn\'t fit the boss image that the late Mayor Daley made famous and that Mayor Washington was beginning to acquire 
49zc040o He\'s a weak guy says Mr\. Rose the political consultant subject to a lot of pressure and obviously not a crusader 
49zc040p The company said it intends to purchase those shares tendered at or below twenty eight dollars a share 
49zc040q Shares tendered at higher prices will be returned to holders Torchmark said 
49zc040r In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday Torchmark closed at twenty seven seventy five up a dollar twenty five 
49zc040s Whoever he is he will have his hands full of problems foreign and domestic 
49zc040t The government\'s finances cry out for a strong president to grapple with them and to persuade a chaotic Congress to accept his program 
49zc040u All over the world there are knotty problems for the U\. S\. from Latin America Nicaragua and Panama to the Middle East 
49zc040v Our presidency is not just a ceremonial office its demands are such as to try any man\'s spirit intelligence and political skill 
49zc040w Neither company has disclosed a possible price but the presence of two interested parties is expected to increase the amount that any buyer would have to pay 
49zc040x Well the company P\. S\. of New Hampshire is in play said Daniel Scotto an analyst at L\. F\. Rothschild 
49zc040y The more people interested the higher the price you\'ll fetch 
49zc040z New York publicists actually are upset 
49zc0410 For them and their celebrity clients getting into Suzy\'s column ratifies their importance 
49zc0411 Her column is among the most widely read in New York rivaled only by Liz Smith\'s 
49zc0412 But Jay Chiat chairman of Chiat Day isn\'t worried 
49zc0413 We started with the umbrella positioning of the corporate name and we\'re moving into specific product areas he says 
49zc0414 We\'re not changing because of any sales situation 
49zc0415 Mr\. Mignanelli meanwhile says he\'s backing Chiat one hundred \%PERCENT and believes that more people now recognize the Nissan name 
49zc0416 Given the nature of our ownership it\'s obviously a very complex issue Mr\. Elish said 
49zc0417 There are a lot of things to consider and we\'re looking at it 
49zc0418 But nothing is imminent 
49zc0419 Rick Briggs president of the union said Falconbridge\'s latest proposals on contracting out are not encouraging 
49zc041a The proposals were presented yesterday after a two day recess in the talks 
49zc041b About forty \%PERCENT of Falconbridge\'s nickel output comes from its Sudbury operations 
49zc041c How did the board vote on the reduction plan 
49zc041d It didn\'t says Mr\. Miller 
49zc041e A twenty two member executive committee now slashed to seven because of resignations handled the voting 
49zc041f The plan passed unanimously 
4a0c0201 Terms weren\'t disclosed 
4a0c0202 The construction has already begun and is expected to be completed in late nineteen eighty seven 
4a0c0203 Fluor said the project will employ about three hundred workers at its peak levels 
4a0c0204 We had to scour the earth to achieve that settlement Mr\. Liebmann said 
4a0c0205 But through it all Ralph was calm and rational 
4a0c0206 [tongue_click] He doesn\'t panic when things start to go wrong [door_slam] 
4a0c0207 The broadcasting properties have long been regarded as GenCorp\'s best defense against a hostile takeover 
4a0c0208 Licenses for two of the television stations and all the radio stations are being challenged by groups who charge that GenCorp is an unfit operator 
4a0c0209 The dispute includes allegations that GenCorp failed to adequately inform the F\. C\. C\. of allegedly improper campaign contributions and foreign payments 
4a0c020a Mr\. Kagler would burst out of the office commenting sarcastically to secretaries about colleagues he considered slow moving including Mr\. Everingham 
4a0c020b [tongue_click] At first what he did was strategic to prod Everingham says one official familiar with the situation 
4a0c020c Later it was from sheer frustration 
4a0c020d But the corpse was soon walking 
4a0c020e During the Progressive Era pressure for more federal spending developed 
4a0c020f In nineteen oh eight the Democratic platform backed a constitutional amendment that would allow Congress to impose a new tax directly on income 
4a0c020g In July nineteen oh nine Congress sent such an amendment to the states for ratification 
4a0c020h U\. S\. Air operates primarily in the East and Midwest 
4a0c020i P\. S\. A\. serves twenty nine airports mainly on the West Coast 
4a0c020j The combination would create the seventh largest domestic air carrier 
4a0c020k The goal of resurgent conservatives have been the same on both sides of the Atlantic a return to a free market economy and a strong defense 
4a0c020l Mrs\. Thatcher\'s reforms have lacked some supply side elements we feel would have improved their effectiveness 
4a0c020m She hasn\'t made a significant move on top marginal rates since her first term 
4a0c020n Instead she has focused on the less incentive sensitive basic rate edging it downward point by point 
4a0c020o NATO leaders ended a two day summit in Brussels 
4a0c020p The alliance issued to a communique that stressed its determination to decide on a comprehensive approach to further arms control treaties 
4a0c020q But it sidestepped decisions on diverse issues such as modernizing the short range nuclear weapons based in West Germany 
4a0c020r By contracting out production to American plants they are saving more than a dime per can of drink 
4a0c020s Their next logical step analysts say will be to acquire U\. S\. soft drink concerns 
4a0c020t [tongue_click] Eventually they might break into the enormous U\. S\. market 
4a0c020u In general Jackson strategists said that they are pleased with the way the Dukakis campaign is treating them 
4a0c020v Adviser Ann Lewis praised the atmosphere of respect and fair play that surrounded both the platform and the rules discussions

4a0c020z Stew Leonard who runs Stew Leonard\'s a large grocery store in Norwalk Connecticut *accommodated* all four of his children this way 
4a0c0210 He first named his oldest son president 
4a0c0211 Then he set up a bakery business in the store for his daughter 
4a0c0212 For his younger son he created an open air farmer\'s market in Danbury Connecticut where he also is building a supermarket for the son to run 
4a0c0213 And Mr\. Leonard\'s other daughter 
4a0c0214 She has become director of the company\'s human resources department 
4a0c0215 But Mr\. Peterson says there still is an image problem 
4a0c0216 If we haven\'t worked with a company before the natural reaction is Why the hell are you bringing in accountants to work in a plant 
4a0c0217 Yeah we probably have the largest manufacturing consulting practice in the world 
4a0c0218 The Bellevue Washington [<door_slam] truck maker said truck sales in Canada Australia the United Kingdom and Mexico all showed gains 
4a0c0219 Sales of mining equipment also picked up although oil field service equipment sales continued to slump 
4a0c021a The company also cited a lower income tax rate 
4a0c021b The inescapable fact however is that one day the water is going to run out or become too *expensive* to pump up 
4a0c021c We\'re going to see less production 
4a0c021d [tongue_click] There\'s no way around it says Kansas State extension economist Mark Nelson 
4a0c021e But it\'s not going to be a cataclysmic thing 
4a0c0301 The economic fallout shouldn\'t be ignored however 
4a0c0302 A provision in the spending bill requires that at least one third of the repair and overhaul work on ships be done locally at their home ports 
4a0c0303 That makes a big deal for Todd and Lockheed Mr\. Dicks says referring to two *Puget* Sound shipyards 
4a0c0304 The disclosures came in a proxy statement amendment filed yesterday with the Securities and Exchange Commission

4a0c0311 Exxon alone cut about three hundred and seventy five million in costs just last year 
4a0c0312 Only two years ago eight hundred Exxon employees occupied thirteen floor of the oil giant\'s New York skyscraper 
4a0c0313 Today after layoffs and transfers only three hundred workers remain on seven floors 
4a0c0314 And the building part of the legacy of Exxon founder John D\. Rockefeller has been sold to a Japanese group

4a0c031b We are extremely selective said Paul Suckow director of fixed income at Oppenheimer Management Corporation 
4a0c031c I don\'t think some issues are going to make it he said

4a0c0401 Caterpillar won\'t discuss the financial impact of the move which the company says was done to reduce labor and parts costs 
4a0c0402 But the dollar\'s twenty \%PERCENT decline against the French franc since December nineteen eighty five could have inflated the company\'s effective production costs by about the same percentage 
4a0c0403 Caterpillar says it hedged against risk from foreign exchange fluctuations on the interbank market helping to ease the falling dollar\'s negative impact 
4a0c0404 Most Indians traveling to Pakistan must do likewise 
4a0c0405 Visas for either country take about a month to obtain

4a0c040h The Pennzoil spokesman said the reorganization plan to be outlined today would be presented as part of a motion opposing Texaco\'s request for more time 
4a0c040i But Westin has shown unspectacular albeit steady earnings in recent years as competition has heated up in the luxury hotel market 
4a0c040j In nineteen eighty six it had operating earnings of fifty five million about four million less than it earned in nineteen eighty two 
4a0c040k Revenue in nineteen eighty six was four hundred ninety one \.POINT six million 
4a0c040l With a rebound in the stock market investors\' fears about a recession cooled and the bond market slumped 
4a0c040m A sharp slide in the U\. S\. dollar also added some downward pressure to bond prices

4a0c040y Since Monday\'s opening bell N\. C\. N\. B\. shares have jumped to four and three eighths points closing at twenty seven seven eighths yesterday 
4a0c040z Many analysts predict the stock could go higher soon perhaps crossing the thirty dollar a share barrier for the first time in a year

4a0c0411 Mr\. Smilow said that the company won\'t have to sell additional assets to finance a new buy out 
4a0c0412 But it will have a lot more debt than it had previously 
4a0c0413 After the buy out is completed he said Playtex Apparel will have total debt of about three hundred and fifty million 
4a0c0414 *Playtex* Holdings\' debt will approach one billion dollars 
4a0c0415 Overall consumer spending has slowed since last year\'s stock market crash but it\'s still at a level that worries some economists 
4a0c0416 Consumer credit slowed sharply in July reflecting sluggish sales 
4a0c0417 Too much spending at home coupled with heavy demand for exports could overload an industrial sector that is already running near capacity 
4a0c0418 To be sure on a lot of scores the summit was a success 
4a0c0419 Economic cooperation was advanced with businessmen signing agreements for about thirty contracts and several joint ventures

4a0c041b Some banking analysts doubt a London or Tokyo bank would make a similar acquisition anytime here soon 
4a0c041c Among other things some foreign banks have been shying away from acquiring assets in the U\. S\. because of unexpectedly high expenses managing them from afar 
4a0c041d Instead the trend among foreign banks is to increasingly build alliances with U\. S\. banks 
4a1c0201 The Iranian crisis and the administration\'s uncertain grip on it has reawakened this cynicism 
4a1c0202 The polls show much of the public does not believe the president when he denies knowing that profits from Iranian arms sales have been used to aid the contras 
4a1c0203 [tongue_click] On this the matter is likely to turn 
4a1c0204 Not on whether the shipments were a good idea or on whether lawyers can find some law that has been broken 
4a1c0205 But on whether President Reagan told the truth when he denied knowing 
4a1c0206 The computer also can display a pattern showing how people normally place the tongue to produce say an s\. sound 
4a1c0207 A deaf person can then try to match the pattern by placing the tongue against the electronic palate 
4a1c0208 With careful coaching and trial and error children like Miss Gilroy can learn how to make sounds that require placing the tongue against the roof of the mouth 
4a1c0209 Mr\. Cash of Harvard adds There is a shortsightedness on the part of the suppliers 
4a1c020a By reducing the importance of personal contacts and establishing standards for communications computers give the buyer an opportunity to show across a broader line of suppliers 
4a1c020b He sees the day when auto makers\' computers will scan the computers of their primary suppliers and automatically place orders with the one offering the lowest price 
4a1c020c Visits to both countries however leave no doubt that the struggle will be long 
4a1c020d For debt in Brazil as in Mexico is only one side of the equation 
4a1c020e The other is finding the resources and the will to overcome a mire of poverty and ignorance 
4a1c020f And in both countries this mire could ultimately prove politically explosive 
4a1c020g The political reasons for Chairman Kennedy\'s single mindedness are clear enough 
4a1c020h Organized labor a major Democratic constituency has fallen on hard times as reflected in a decline in the unionized share of the U\. S\. work force 
4a1c020i Democrats in Congress want to use political muscle to give labor things it now has difficulty winning at the bargaining table 
4a1c020j Congress gets credit for doing something nice for labor and employers foot the bill 
4a1c020k Selling the Canadian business will help T\. L\. C\. Group complete its financing on the rest of Beatrice international operations 
4a1c020l [tongue_click] T\. L\. C\. Group said yesterday that it has a firm commitment from Drexel Burnham Lambert Incorporated its investment banker to finance its acquisition 
4a1c020m A Drexel spokesman said he expects the financing to come through a combination of bank loans and high yield bonds 
4a1c020n Drexel financed the Kohlberg Kravis buy out of Beatrice last year 
4a1c020o The legislation puts Swiss insider laws more in line with those of other European countries 
4a1c020p Switzerland currently allows the insider to be free but can punish those who profit from a tip 
4a1c020q Meanwhile an informal pact between the U\. S\. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Swiss Bankers Association concerning insider trading investigations has existed since nineteen eighty two 
4a1c020r The pact requires a customer of Swiss banks to waive secrecy rights if the customer is linked to an insider trading case by the S\. E\. C\. 
4a1c020s Robert H\. Sewell chairman of Equitable Bankshares Incorporated a small Dallas based bank holding company was astonished at the opulence 
4a1c020t I don\'t look at it as bank furniture he says 
4a1c020u Bankers don\'t have this kind of stuff 
4a1c020v Nevertheless he arrived with a hundred thousand dollars in cashier\'s checks enough he figures to outfit half of two new branches 
4a1c020w Usually he calculates he would spend three hundred and fifty thousand dollars to buy that much furniture and equipment 
4a1c020x He also was in the market for automated teller machines and other banking equipment 
4a1c020y Some issuers also are wary of doing away with outside counsel 
4a1c020z In Washington state a proposal to use the attorney general as counsel on all state bond issues came before a legislative committee last year 
4a1c0210 Its adoption would have saved Washington more than two hundred thousand dollars a year 
4a1c0211 Strong opposition from the attorney general\'s office defeated the proposal however 
4a1c0212 There are numerous other provisions in the trade bill that America\'s partners find no less disconcerting 
4a1c0213 Companies that violate export controls for instance could be barred from the U\. S\. market and government contracts for five years 
4a1c0214 Also problematic in my view is that the U\. S\. would call foreign companies to account for violations of foreign law committed abroad 
4a1c0215 Restricting the president\'s scope for action regarding imports also could tend to harden international fronts 
4a1c0216 Each decade since the nineteen sixties has spawned a welfare reform movement 
4a1c0217 The first of these in the form of Lyndon Johnson\'s Great Society led to a massive growth of the federal government\'s role 
4a1c0218 The second tried to amend the incentives of the system to encourage work and family stability and to provide a minimum income for families 
4a1c0219 The reform movement of the eighties combines tougher approaches to work requirements and family support with more generous aid for training 
4a1c021a Yet the welfare bill that the president will sign into law tomorrow constitutes only a marginal change in the system 
4a1c021b Meanwhile poverty continues welfare dependency increases and the underclass expands 
4a1c021c His best pitch is his sinker and it\'s a great one 
4a1c021d But he\'s got to pinpoint it to make it effective and that\'s really difficult to do inning after inning and game after game said Dempsey 
4a1c021e He was able to stay in a groove longer than any pitcher I\'ve seen 
4a1c021f It\'s study attitude and concentration and who knows what else 
4a1c021g [tongue_click] All I know is that wherever I put my glove tonight Thursday it\'s mostly where the ball went 
4a1c0301 [tongue_click] That hardly matters said Sir Geoffrey noting that with all the traitor spies that preceded him there wasn\'t much left to tell 
4a1c0302 The point is he was one of us 
4a1c0303 He joined M\. fifteen straight out of Oxford 
4a1c0304 Been in the civil service all his life 
4a1c0305 He has a huge sense of humor and is by all accounts a nice man 
4a1c0306 Critics say he is captivated by his own eloquence 
4a1c0307 ~ -True he says Sometimes I don\'t know when to shut up 
4a1c0308 Regardless of what political label they think is appropriate almost everyone regards George Bush as a decent honest and likable person 
4a1c0309 And most would agree that his personal history has a storybook [door_slam>] quality about it 
4a1c030a Somebody once said George Bush has led the life that Ronald Reagan portrays says Pete Teeley a longtime aide 
4a1c030b Drexel\'s Mr\. Joseph calls *Staley\'s* allegations outrageous 
4a1c030c He acknowledges that some of the statements attributed to Mr\. Dahl were made but says that others weren\'t 
4a1c030d He says that he doesn\'t believe Drexel customers\' holdings in Staley were ever large enough to require a thirteen D\. filing 
4a1c030e The DeBartolos based on their previous takeover attempts have the financial wherewithal to make a bid for Zayre 
4a1c030f The family\'s personal wealth is estimated at six hundred and fifty million dollars and they arranged financing for the multibillion dollar bids for Allied and Carter Hawley 
4a1c030g The DeBartolos lost out in the bidding for Allied to Campeau Corporation a Toronto real estate firm

4a1c030l [tongue_click] But Scali McCabe won\'t be earning commissions from the purchase of media spots for Kids R\. Us 
4a1c030m Media placement for the unit like its parent is done by other firms 
4a1c030n Scali McCabe will instead be paid on a negotiated fee basis for creating the ads 
4a1c030o The fees weren\'t disclosed 
4a1c030p Certain elements of a national system were obvious and quickly made their way into use 
4a1c030q The first was a composite tape that brought information from various market centers onto one ticker tape 
4a1c030r A composite quotation display system soon followed allowing customers and brokers to see quotes from all markets on a single screen 
4a1c030s And an Intermarket Trading System allowed orders coming to various exchange floors to flow from one exchange to another quickly easily and at no cost 
4a1c030t Many fund managers here say America isn\'t taking the strong medicine needed to curb high consumer spending improve low personal savings rates and combat the stubborn dual deficits 
4a1c030u They don\'t expect any progress before the new U\. S\. president takes office next year and say both inflation and interest rates probably will rise 
4a1c030v This would increase the likelihood of a nineteen eighty nine recession 
4a1c030w It has now been eleven nights since the arrest of Francis Seow former solicitor general and law society president in Singapore 
4a1c030x While Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew\'s government has admitted holding Mr\. Seow it has kept him totally incommunicado 
4a1c030y It has refused requests to see him from both his family and his lawyer 
4a1c030z Within an hour Barclays P\. L\. C\. Lloyds Bank P\. L\. C\. and the London unit of Citicorp increased their base rates 
4a1c0310 [tongue_click] The Barclays boost took effect immediately while the other two banks\' moves were effective at the close of business 
4a1c0311 Similar increases by National Westminster Bank P\. L\. C\. and Midland Bank P\. L\. C\. go into effect today 
4a1c0312 Base rates are the benchmark for commercial lending in Britain 
4a1c0313 This lack of understanding has investors licking their chops on two fronts 
4a1c0314 One camp thinks that the stock has remained undervalued as investors grapple to comprehend the businesses 
4a1c0315 Another camp hopes for a takeover or leveraged buy out though the Erie Pennsylvania company says it doesn\'t know of any such thing in the works 
4a1c0316 He is striking now at a time when financing for big deals is readily available and the stock price is down 
4a1c0317 [tongue_click] As recently as August R\. J\. R\.\'s stock was trading lower than its forty nine dollar level when Mr\. Johnson took over in January nineteen eighty seven 
4a1c0318 The offer for a leveraged buy out probably will be at about seventy five dollars a share and now other tobacco stocks are soaring too 
4a1c0319 Here are price trends on the world\'s major stock markets as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective Geneva 
4a1c031a To make them directly comparable each index is based on the close of nineteen sixty nine equaling one hundred 
4a1c031b The percentage change is since year end 
4a1c031c One new directorate member isn\'t likely to change *Bundesbank* policy 
4a1c031d But *Bundesbank* watchers expect Mr\. Tietmeyer to side with Mr\. Poehl\'s monetary policies which emphasize international cooperation over unilateral actions 
4a1c031e [tongue_click] Other council members have frequently clashed with Mr\. Poehl over his effort to coordinate West German currency and interest rate moves with other central banks 
4a1c0401 The Federal Reserve Board in Washington has lost track of a hundred and thirty five \.POINT nine billion dollars 
4a1c0402 [tongue_click] Its trackers figure that American adults have eighteen billion dollars in their pockets and around the house 
4a1c0403 [tongue_click] But that is only about twelve \%PERCENT of the bills and loose change they can\'t directly account for 
4a1c0404 He took the tag number of their car Mr\. Clifton recalled referring to Mr\. McGee 
4a1c0405 And he came and got me and said Hey this is the real thing [door_slam] 
4a1c0406 It\'s not a fluke 
4a1c0407 It appears to be true 
4a1c0408 Manga fits nicely into a life style that provides little time or opportunity to actually live one\'s fantasies 
4a1c0409 For example students whose days actually are spent studying become comic book secret agents and soldiers 
4a1c040a And a frequent manga theme is a boy\'s love affair with his buxom teacher 
4a1c040b Much of the optimism fueling Western financial flows to the Soviets . is a reaction to Mr\. Gorbachev\'s glasnost 
4a1c040c But there is no guarantee that he will still be in power when the Soviets owe sixty billion dollars 
4a1c040d Another reform minded leader Nikita Khrushchev tried to kick start the Soviet economy in the early nineteen sixties and was sent packing 
4a1c040e Nearly twenty years of economic mismanagement followed 
4a1c040f Even if Mr\. Gorbachev should deliver his promised reforms there is reason to doubt he will be able to meet payments on all these new loans 
4a1c040g Hungary began its flirtation with market economics in nineteen sixty eight yet today is in the midst of a severe debt crunch 
4a1c040h More traditional academics say many of the newer journals are merely platforms for marginal scholars to write on trivial topics 
4a1c040i [tongue_click] I\'m dimly aware that they\'re out there says Richard Ullman professor of international affairs at Princeton University and a former editor of Foreign Policy magazine 
4a1c040j But I can\'t imagine that people who publish something that\'s important wouldn\'t want to publish in the leading journals 
4a1c040k But that was an aberration 
4a1c040l [tongue_click] Dick doesn\'t get highs and lows like the rest of us says d- Oklahoma Democratic Republican Mike Synar a friend and backer 
4a1c040m He\'s like the star quarterback steady 
4a1c040n The team knows he\'s the best hope they\'ve got 
4a1c040o Admiral Crowe isn\'t defensive about mistakes 
4a1c040p If there\'s one profession in which you can\'t mount an error free operation it\'s the military he says 
4a1c040q In this case the J\. C\. S\. chief feared that Congress might curtail the Navy operation if the U\. S\. repeatedly looked ill prepared 
4a1c040r I had really underestimated how involved Congress would get and how determined they would be to politicize it he says 
4a1c040s The following officers directors and large stockholders of companies reported changes in holdings under the Securities Exchange Act of nineteen thirty four 
4a1c040t Those identified as beneficial owners hold at least ten \%PERCENT of a company\'s equity securities 
4a1c040u [tongue_click] Unless otherwise noted changes involved direct holdings of common stock and took place in May nineteen eighty eight 
4a1c040v Companies are listed where transactions generally aggregate ten thousand shares or one hundred thousand dollars 
4a1c040w Many parents impatient for change in the schools respond by keeping their kids out of kindergarten an extra year 
4a1c040x [tongue_click] Motives are mixed 
4a1c040y Some say they want to protect their children others angle for an age advantage that will vault their offspring to the head of the class the following year 
4a1c040z Many schools are encouraging holdouts resulting in what some educators call the graying of kindergarten 
4a1c0410 Further signs of strong U\. S\. economic growth are expected to emerge from a Labor Department report next Friday on the nation\'s employment picture for August 
4a1c0411 [tongue_click] If so Federal Reserve officials may raise short term interest rates further within a few weeks several analysts said 
4a1c0412 They also predicted that banks will raise their prime or base rates again to ten and a half \%PERCENT or eleven \%PERCENT from the current ten \%PERCENT level 
4a1c0413 [tongue_click] As many employers are the big broker is ending a defined benefit plan . that provided pensions based on salary and years of service 
4a1c0414 Defined benefits have become costlier to administer because of new tax and accounting rules 
4a1c0415 And employees tend to see a pension years away as less valuable than a payment here and now 
4a1c0416 All of this has led more firms to adopt defined contribution plans in which salary and service determine annual payments to an employee\'s account 
4a1c0417 But the company also is suffering the consequences of some basic strategic errors 
4a1c0418 For example Advanced Micro was slow to begin producing chips made with a fabrication technology called complementary metal oxide semiconductor or CMOS 
4a1c0419 They use less power and run faster than conventional chips but Advanced Micro remained committed to an older technology until nineteen eighty seven 
4a1c041a Investors continue to flock to the more conservative stock portfolios 
4a1c041b [tongue_click] Growth and income funds which combine hefty dividends with the goal of capital appreciation [door_slam] led all other stock fund categories in sales for June 
4a1c041c Among bond funds long term municipal funds captured the top spot 
4a2c0201 When Hu Yaobang was dumped in January as the Communist Party\'s secretary general Mr\. Zhao was elevated to that post on an acting basis 
4a2c0202 That made Mr\. Zhao a protege of Deng Xiaoping the de facto head of the party as well as the government [door_slam] 
4a2c0203 It is a delicate position requiring him to maneuver among various interest groups and personal cliques that make up China\'s top leadership 
4a2c0204 [door_slam] In the carefree days before deregulation in nineteen seventy eight five big airlines handled most of the passenger traffic in and out of [<door_slam] Lambert Saint 
4a2c0205 Louis International airport

4a2c0208 In Asian trading yesterday the dollar rebounded from what some traders said was an oversold condition 
4a2c0209 Wednesday\'s decline triggered buy orders and some traders bought dollars to cover short or oversold positions 
4a2c020a But after climbing to intraday heights of one \.POINT eight oh five five marks and one hundred and forty one \.POINT sixty six yen the dollar began sinking again 
4a2c020b Southland would have about four \.POINT eighty nine billion dollars of debt after the buy out is completed 
4a2c020c The company plans to pay off about one billion dollars of that by the end of nineteen eighty nine largely from the sale of assets 
4a2c020d Southland expects proceeds from asset sales to total eight hundred and sixty seven million dollars by the end of next year 
4a2c020e Bids totaling three hundred and seventy six million dollars were submitted [<door_slam] 
4a2c020f Accepted bids ranged from seven . \.POINT one five \%PERCENT to seven \.POINT one seven three \%PERCENT 
4a2c020g The bank holding company slated another fifty million dollar sale next Tuesday 
4a2c020h The administration expects economic growth to rebound after the effects of the stock market crash wane 
4a2c020i It forecasts a three \.POINT five \%PERCENT growth rate for nineteen eighty nine and nineteen ninety and steadily falling interest rates and inflation rates 
4a2c020j But forecasters inside government and out have a poor record in predicting economic trends that far in the future 
4a2c020k For a ship or missile guided by the wrong time signal that little gap could mean arriving at the wrong destination 
4a2c020l If we let the difference grow says Mr\. McCarthy we could run into problems over thousands of years 
4a2c020m It might be noon by atomic time but dark outside [door_slam] 
4a2c020n Moreover some housing specialists say permit activity is a poor indicator [door_slam>] of future starts arguing that it reflects current housing activity rather than predicting future activity 
4a2c020o They predict that instead of falling housing starts will improve in coming months in reaction to increasing new and existing home sales 
4a2c020p One notable exception to this trend will be the Southwest which has been battered by recession and a housing glut 
4a2c020q Anyone who accepts the job of investigating the Speaker should be prepared to take some heat

4a2c020s The Speaker retaliated in a public statement and [<door_slam] his minions in the leadership said the group was dead on Capitol Hill 
4a2c020t But Mr\. Edell has argued that Mrs\. Cipollone [<door_slam] heard conflicting messages about the hazards of her habit 
4a2c020u In a deposition read to the court in April Mrs\. Cipollone said she was initially attracted to smoking because of its seductive connotations of Hollywood and glamour 
4a2c020v The cigarette makers\' advertisements reinforced these perceptions and others of the product\'s safety the plaintiff contends 
4a2c020w Mr\. Agee said the losses were a disappointment and a surprise to the board too 
4a2c020x That suggests that Mr\. Agee might have been brought in to shake things up

4a2c020z Mr\. Icahn wants to give holders a mixture of twenty dollars a share in cash and about thirty dollars a share face amount of debentures 
4a2c0210 On some ledgers that might seem to add to up to fifty dollars 
4a2c0211 But some insiders apparently prefer thirty six to thirty eight dollars in cash 
4a2c0212 Four T\. W\. A\. vice presidents three current one departed recently sold all their shares at those prices 
4a2c0213 Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value 
4a2c0214 Thus higher bidding narrows the investor\'s return while lower bidding widens it 
4a2c0215 The percentage rates are calculated on a three hundred sixty day year while the coupon equivalent yield is based on a three hundred sixty five day year 
4a2c0216 Suez which had to raise its capital several times last year through rights issues to fund its Belgian battle says it can fund its acquisition of C\.

4a2c0218 One source says Suez if victorious would likely resell part of its stake in C\. 
4a2c0219 Industrielle to recoup part of its costs 
4a2c021a It could also sell off C\.

4a2c0304 Mr\. Scanlon expects business to begin tailing off only after April fifteenth until then people will still be making contributions to I\. R\. A\.s for nineteen eighty six 
4a2c0305 Such contributions even if they\'re made in early nineteen eighty seven qualify for a full tax deduction 
4a2c0306 A person who puts two thousand dollars into an I\. R\. A\. can deduct two thousand dollars from the nineteen eighty six gross income in determining taxable income 
4a2c0307 Depending on the person\'s nineteen eighty six tax bracket that can save up to one thousand dollars in federal taxes 
4a2c0308 Mr\. Cruz said he had set deadlines for the implementation of the reforms he was proposing

4a2c031a According to the ideas of John Locke whom our revolutionary forefathers vigorously debated free men and women may engage in a social contract

4a2c031d [door_slam] As many employers are the big broker is ending a defined benefit plan that provided pensions based on salary and years of service 
4a2c031e Defined benefits have become costlier to administer because of new tax and accounting rules 
4a2c031f And employees tend to see a pension years away as less valuable than a payment here and now 
4a2c031g All of this has led more firms to adopt defined contribution plans in which salary and service determine annual payments to an employee\'s account 
4a2c0401 I was startled startled isn\'t the word reacted Alvin Novick a biology professor at Yale University 
4a2c0402 He warned [<door_slam] that forced testing such as contemplated by the centers would drive homosexuals underground and away from cooperation with public health programs 
4a2c0403 Rational people won\'t cooperate in ruining their own lives he said 
4a2c0404 While he believes the dollar will move lower against the major currencies the softening export market is pressuring Japanese and European exporters 
4a2c0405 That of course is limiting the attractiveness of these company stocks 
4a2c0406 These stocks have gone up to such an extent that the price earnings multiple is much higher abroad than here 
4a2c0407 That would make non dollar equity investment less attractive 
4a2c0408 Lone Star Industries Incorporated said it arranged a one hundred and fifty million dollar financing through issuance of promissory notes to a group of twenty two lenders

4a3c0219 Whether the East German government can extricate itself from its current crisis is a question that confounds Western analysts 
4a3c021a However most agree that East Germany is lurching toward crisis 
4a3c021b Above all it is a crisis that the nation\'s aging leaders seem utterly confused by 
4a3c021c With the rest of the East bloc swept up in a tide of economic and political change East Berlin has steadfastly stuck to its old ways

4a3c030w Because Pirelli exports only specialty tires to the U\. S\. and has no manufacturing operations there it lacks brand name recognition and needs a partner analysts say

4a3c031c Strikes also were threatened in Georgia 
4a3c0401 Had that happened the failed banks would have been turned over to the F\. D\. I\. C\. [<door_slam] for disposition 
4a3c0402 In most cases the agency sells the failed bank to another institution along with the good loans 
4a3c0403 The F\. D\. I\. C\. purchases the bad loans and tries to salvage whatever it can 
4a3c0404 These criticisms are overwrought and unconvincing 
4a3c0405 While private operators will certainly lobby in their own interest it does not follow that they could manipulate public opinion and lawmakers as easily as their opponents suggest 
4a3c0406 Nor is it clear that private prison operators would have to lobby for harsher sentences 
4a3c0407 Given current levels of overcrowding and public sentiment in favor of stricter sentencing there will be no s- shortage of inmates to fill new facilities 
4a3c0408 Although some cabinet ministers had been expected to step down the mass action took many by surprise

4a3c040i Some congressional committees refuse to hear him at all others will listen only if he testifies under oath 
4a3c040j [misc_noise] Only last week the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee threw him out of a closed briefing on the alleged invasion 
4a3c040k Why anyone should take seriously anything Mr\. Abrams says about Central America defies comprehension 
4a3c040l [tongue_click] Not long after the Northwest announcement the institute wired a press release to media organizations detailing the large number of passenger complaints about Northwest\'s service 
4a3c040m Airline passengers who fly Northwest appear to have a lot to complain about and they did so in droves last year the release began 
4a3c040n It went on to say that complaints against Northwest increased one thousand four hundred and eighteen \%PERCENT in the past year 
4a3c040o Some wonder whether all the conversions don\'t make Mr\. Beregovoy more of an opportunist than a believer in the market economy 
4a3c040p But his aides say he was convinced that he was doing the right thing 
4a3c040q Mr\. Beregovoy said I\'m not ashamed of what I do 
4a3c040r But critics charged that the collar actually added to volatility by making it more difficult for index arbitragers to do their business 
4a3c040s Many traders argue that such arbitrage has the effect of smoothing out volatility in the markets 
4a3c040t Index arbitragers buy and sell large amounts of stocks and stock index futures to take advantage of brief price disparities between the two related instruments 
4a3c040u Almost unnoticed in discussions of the procurement scandal is the fact that this elaborate indeed tortuous system seems to have worked at least on its own terms 
4a3c040v Nobody was able to throw a contract directly 
4a3c040w Instead what some contractors seem to have done is to buy inside information that would allow them to prepare a better proposal

4a3c0414 I send my own clients to him 
4a3c0415 [tongue_click] Analysts say they expect P\. and G\'s momentum to carry into nineteen ninety and beyond and many raised their fiscal nineteen ninety estimates 
4a3c0416 Brenda Lee Landry of Morgan Stanley raised her estimate to . eight dollars and thirty cents from an earlier estimate of eight dollars and fifteen cents 
4a3c0417 Kidder\'s Mr\. Freedman and Joseph Kozloff at Drexel Burnham Lambert raised their estimates to eight dollars and fifty cents a share from eight dollars and twenty five cents 
4a3c0418 I can see a number close to ten dollars for nineteen ninety one says Mr\. Kozloff 
4a3c0419 [misc_noise] To the extent that export growth continues it will keep the U\. S\. economy from slipping added Mr\. Witten 
4a3c041a So you can have a soft landing scenario based on expanding exports 
4a3c041b A soft landing combines moderate economic growth with low inflation 
4a3c041c So what is Wall Street telling the queasy investors that hold shares in generic drug makers

4a4c0201 John Sloan\'s people are largely taken for granted but as it happens they have been the stars of the American economy in the nineteen eighties 
4a4c0202 [tongue_click] As big corporations have laid off workers by the thousands to meet competitive pressures small firms have more than cushioned the blow 
4a4c0203 They have created some ten million new jobs since nineteen eighty according to an estimate made at last year\'s White House Conference on Small Business 
4a4c0204 [tongue_click] Moreover equal opportunity is the rule mainly because small entrepreneurs make their own opportunities

4a4c020y [tongue_click] One big play last year was leisure

4a4c0210 Once you get that theme the level of the Price Earnings ratio doesn\'t mean a damn says Mr\. Robins 
4a4c0211 It\'s all a bit of a mirage 
4a4c0212 Yet one that so far has worked 
4a4c0213 Moreover Mr\. Fair\'s predictions tend to improve with age 
4a4c0214 [tongue_click] Back in nineteen seventy six he was giving President Ford the incumbent\'s four point advantage 
4a4c0215 [tongue_click] After the election he took it away 
4a4c0216 Unlike Lyndon Johnson Mr\. Ford wasn\'t ever elected vice president Mr\. Fair explains feebly 
4a4c0217 When Mr\. Fair presents the results of his equation today it still shows a Ford victory but by a less embarrassing margin 
4a4c0218 This novel economic approach ignores the merchandise trade deficit central bank intervention and all that mumbo jumbo 
4a4c0219 That\'s not how they teach economics at Hamburger University Instead the Big Mac Index simply looks at world wide prices of hamburgers at today\'s exchange rates 
4a4c021a That quickly shows which currencies are too strong or weak and by how much 
4a4c021b [other_mouth_sound] On the other side of the commodity coin is Indonesia hurt by weak petroleum prices and lagging agricultural growth 
4a4c021c [tongue_click] Indonesia has boosted non oil exports this year for the first time oil and gas will account for less than half the nation\'s export earnings

4a4c030d [tongue_click] That leaves retail brokerage firms with a stark choice 
4a4c030e They can move onto the institutional firms\' turf and fight for a top spot in investment banking 
4a4c030f [tongue_click] Or they can settle into the second rank of the securities business perhaps forever 
4a4c030g The complex plan gradually gives the company to the debt holders said Charles E\. Bayless financial vice president 
4a4c030h In contrast if the utility began bankruptcy proceedings they the debt holders would get it right now he said 
4a4c030i [tongue_click] In either case the interests of the utility\'s common shareholders would be substantially diluted he said 
4a4c030j [tongue_click] Another reason Mr\. Soifer is avoiding Morgan and Citicorp is that their stock prices at times have tended to gyrate more violently than other bank issues 
4a4c030k Citicorp and Morgan tend to have more volatility on days when program trading is known to occur Mr\. Soifer says 
4a4c030l [tongue_click] They\'re more of a bet on which way the market is headed 
4a4c030m Mr\. Reichler recently stunned some liberals when he agreed to represent the Guatemalan government in its quest to win U\. S\. aid for its police force and military 
4a4c030n Some human rights groups strongly opposed the request citing Guatemalan authorities\' history of abuses 
4a4c030o Mr\. Reichler launched a lobbying blitz among U\. S\. liberals arguing that the aid would help stem violations 
4a4c030p The police got two million dollars for training and Guatemala also got seven million dollars in military assistance 
4a4c030q [tongue_click] Administrators blame the high cost of care on such factors as rising salaries which they say account for as much as sixty \%PERCENT of expenses 
4a4c030r They say a nationwide nursing shortage forces them to pay bonuses for qualified help 
4a4c030s But even at this price there are shortcomings 
4a4c030t [tongue_click] Scientific studies have concluded that the device caused infections that led to severe complications 
4a4c030u Robins still contends other factors including sexually transmitted disease contributed to the injuries 
4a4c030v The company also insists the Shield isn\'t any more dangerous than other I\. U\. D\.s 
4a4c030w Ne Win\'s single party political system long has been unpopular but it has remained in power largely because of military support 
4a4c030x In his twenty six year rule Ne Win transformed Burma from one of Southeast Asia\'s richest societies to one of the world\'s poorest countries 
4a4c030y [tongue_click] Under his Burmese Way to Socialism the state took control of almost all aspects of economic political and social life 
4a4c030z The public filings show that a firm called Camro Associates acquired a one \%PERCENT nonvoting stake in Seemala in nineteen eighty four 
4a4c0310 Seemala disclosed the Camro stake in a public S\. E\. C\. filing that year Seemala didn\'t identify the investors in Camro 
4a4c0311 But a separate nineteen eighty four filing by Camro in California identifies Camro as a general partnership made up of Mr\. Milken and twenty six other Drexel employees 
4a4c0312 In the current debate Mr\. Bush is using the A\. C\. L\. U\. to pin a liberal label on his Democratic challenger 
4a4c0313 But the A\. C\. L\. U\. has relied throughout much of its history on Republican support and has allied itself with Republicans on numerous issues 
4a4c0314 In the current controversy some Republicans are trying to minimize their past involvement 
4a4c0315 To be sure the deficit has declined in the past few years 
4a4c0316 But that decline is entirely the result of a rising surplus in the Social Security trust fund 
4a4c0317 That money should be invested to help defray the future retirement costs of the baby boomers instead it is being used to paper over the deficit 
4a4c0318 That\'s yet another symptom of Mr\. Darman\'s national now now ism 
4a4c0319 Our problem is getting this very very advanced technology to actually work says Anthony Simonds Gooding British Satellite\'s chief executive officer 
4a4c031a Our credibility is close to zero until then 
4a4c031b Some analysts take a harsher view 
4a4c031c There is a serious question mark over B\. S\. B\. management says Mark Astaire a media analyst at U\. K\. brokers Hoare Govett Limited 
4a4c031d So far everything has gone wrong 
4a4c0401 That hardly matters says Sir Geoffrey noting that with all the traitor spies that preceded him there wasn\'t much left to tell 
4a4c0402 The point is he was one of us 
4a4c0403 He joined M\. I\. five straight out of Oxford 
4a4c0404 Been in the civil service all his life 
4a4c0405 The sale also provides the federal government with cash as it tries to narrow the budget deficit 
4a4c0406 After subtracting underwriters\' fees of about seventy million dollars the government\'s net proceeds from the offering are one \.POINT five eight billion dollars 
4a4c0407 In addition the government has already been paid three hundred million dollars from Conrail\'s cash reserves under provisions of the public offering 
4a4c0408 A source close to Texaco said that while Texaco is anxious to emerge from Chapter eleven it isn\'t in the company\'s or shareholders\' interest to rush into a settlement 
4a4c0409 It\'s normal for creditors to want a quick settlement 
4a4c040a But Texaco\'s shareholders have a big say in this case and they aren\'t pushing for a settlement for settlement\'s sake the source said 
4a4c040b [misc_noise] But on Tuesday Kidder Peabody\'s Jack Kirnan dropped Chrysler to a hold rating 
4a4c040c Vans and trucks are selling well he concedes but Chrysler\'s car sales have been very disappointing 
4a4c040d He also figures Chrysler will take longer than expected to straighten out American Motors which it acquired Wednesday 
4a4c040e But even investors who do all the homework and request all the documents shouldn\'t feel too complacent 
4a4c040f The financial statements must be updated every year so new prospectuses are issued annually

4a4c040k The window of opportunity for the creation of superregional banks might not be open long 
4a4c040l Then we will face the challenge of consolidating our positions 
4a4c040m It\'s going to be tough 
4a4c040n What has distinguished us is that our returns on assets and equity are far above average 
4a4c040o Maintaining those levels that\'s going to be the challenge 
4a4c040p Yet he strives to reassure Canada\'s middle class calling himself a Scandinavian style Social Democrat who appreciates the benefits of capitalism 
4a4c040q There\'s no mindless attempt to say we\'re going to tax private corporations out of existence he says

4a4c040s You want them to do well 
4a4c040t But Scali McCabe won\'t be earning commissions from the purchase of media spots for Kids R\. Us 
4a4c040u Media placement for the unit like its parent is done by other firms 
4a4c040v Scali McCabe will instead be paid on a negotiated fee basis for creating the ads 
4a4c040w The fees weren\'t disclosed 
4a4c040x But critics charged that the collar actually added to volatility by making it more difficult for index arbitragers to do their business 
4a4c040y Many traders argue that such arbitrage has the effect of smoothing out volatility in the markets 
4a4c040z Index arbitragers buy and sell large amounts of stocks and stocks index futures to take advantage of brief price disparities between the two related instruments 
4a4c0410 Bankers Trust\'s quarterly provision for credit losses totaled five million dollars compared with twenty million dollars a year earlier 
4a4c0411 But the bank had net recoveries of three \.POINT one million dollars compared with nineteen million dollars of net charge offs in the year earlier quarter 
4a4c0412 And the total allowance for credit losses remained unchanged at one \.POINT three billion dollars 
4a4c0413 Joint venture projects that are still under negotiation are to be scrutinized Chinese officials say 
4a4c0414 Those involving construction of hotels or office buildings aren\'t likely to win government approval 
4a4c0415 China is expected to continue to approve most investments in export related industries and in projects covering energy transport communications raw materials and chemicals 
4a4c0416 A shortage of energy and raw materials is already wreaking havoc in many of China\'s major industries 
4a4c0417 A factory that makes Nike shoes in Guangdong Province has to run a generator three days a week to stay in operation 
4a4c0418 The plant\'s Taiwanese joint venture partners are stockpiling coal and oil for power in case their supplies get cut off 
4a4c0419 Many nearby Chinese factories simply shut down two or three days a week for want of energy 
4a4c041a Moreover two thousand workers at the Tianjin aluminum products factory recently were ordered home because the company couldn\'t get enough raw materials 
4a4c041b At one point this year supply shortages forced a third of the nation\'s aluminum factories to close 
4a4c041c Meanwhile civil RICO continues to attract plaintiffs who want to turn general business disputes that belong in state courts into federal offenses 
4a4c041d For example a small consortium of contractors who consulted me had submitted the low bid for a large marina to be constructed on Lake Michigan 
4a4c041e The second lowest bidder recently filed a civil RICO action claiming that misrepresentations were made by the successful bidders using the telephone thereby committing federal wire fraud 
4a4c041f No matter what the determination of the suit the low bidders already have felt the sting of such poisonous words as racketeer 
4a5c0201 Such results are causing some Wall Street professionals to take the January indicator less *seriously* than they used to 
4a5c0202 In putting less emphasis on some of these traditional *barometers* says Eugene Peroni director of technical research for Janney Montgomery Scott Inc\. in Philadelphia 
4a5c0203 They are not the most scientific things around 
4a5c0204 Mr\. Walter would be rich if not for his awful business sense says his brother Daniel a marketing executive 
4a5c0205 My mother says Go help your brother 
4a5c0206 I say The only way I could help him is with a garbage truck to haul away the old computer manuals that litter his apartment 
4a5c0207 Like their economies the currency of the United States and Canada are closely related 
4a5c0208 But as interest rates rise in Canada the Canadian dollar is gaining on its U\. S\. counterpart traders and analysts say 
4a5c0209 And as the Canadian unit rises it lures more foreign investment particularly from Japan which adds to its strength [loud_breath] 
4a5c020a In Viedma meanwhile deputy governor Oscar Machado exudes provincial confidence

4a5c020d He says he expects President Alfonsin to start coming regularly next year 
4a5c020e In more recent times the legal profession has an exclusive club that looked after its own 
4a5c020f Squabbles were settled behind the courthouse

4a5c020h Clients would have thought it scandalous to sue the family or company lawyer 
4a5c020i General Ramos also confirmed for the first time that Philippine authorities were looking into possible foreign involvement in the coup attempt the Associated Press reported

4a5c020m It has already gathered six hundred million to seven hundred million fund officials said 
4a5c020n The fund\'s limited partners include some of the largest most powerful corporations in the world said Peter G\. Peterson Blackstone Group\'s chairman 
4a5c020o Discussing the proposed agreement Norman Bailey a Washington based consultant and former member of the National Security Council said It\'s ridiculous 
4a5c020p It\'s worse than a jerry built house [loud_breath] 
4a5c020q From the banks\' standpoint he characterized the proposed agreement as almost worse than lending themselves the money 
4a5c020r He helped us to look at different options says Alfred S\. Warren the G\. M\. vice president leading the negotiations under Mr\. Johnson 
4a5c020s He was very *refreshing* in some of his thoughts and ideas

4a5c020z Over half a century federal policy has sapped the productivity of the world\'s strongest agriculture industry 
4a5c0210 The real issue is not the dollar amount of U\. S\. food exports but whether those exports are sold at a profit or a loss 
4a5c0211 The sooner politicians stop trying to help farmers the better off the most efficient productive farmers will be 
4a5c0212 Esprit is now a leaner company that operates more conventionally 
4a5c0213 According to Mr\. Federico the operations chief each division now has a budget to follow for the first time 
4a5c0214 The new executives in Esprit\'s senior management including veterans from Calvin Klein and Izod LaCoste have tightened marketing and quality controls

4a5c0219 Until now sanctions backers in Congress have been able to use South Africa for their own domestic political purposes without taking into account the full costs 
4a5c021a The suffering that sanctions have inflicted on blacks and the loss of U\. S\. influence in the region have not impressed them much 
4a5c021b But the next round will do more severe damage on their own constituents 
4a5c021c That will be something to think about as the Senate debates whether to second the scorched earth policy the House has adopted 
4a5c021d Brokerage firms which negotiate rates with the banks and thrifts whose C\. D\.s they sell offer some of the best yields

4a5c030e There is also a securities law issue which had led the Securities and Exchange Commission to file an amicus brief on behalf of Texaco\'s appeal 
4a5c030f Rule ten b\. thirteen says once a tender offer begins the bidder must treat all shareholders alike 
4a5c030g But Pennzoil offered to pay the Getty Museum more for its shares sooner than it would pay other shareholders even if the merger failed 
4a5c030h The S\. E\. C\. said that this plainly violated Rule ten b\. thirteen 
4a5c030i [tongue_click] Even if there was a contract it was void

4a5c0403 Officials say television warnings will follow 
4a5c0404 However the Reagan administration has its own priorities 
4a5c0405 It has been pressuring Germany to cut its interest rates to stimulate economic growth and by implication . create a bigger market for U\. S\. exports 
4a5c0406 This explains the war of words over Germany\'s refusal to cut interest rates for much of last year 
4a5c0407 The dispute can be expected to continue after the present center right coalition government of Chancellor Helmut Kohl records its expected election victory next week

4a6c0304 The remaining offsetting collections of more than three million dollars comes from user fees which also clearly are not taxes 
4a6c0305 A user fee is a specific charge for a direct benefit received 
4a6c0306 Like an asset sale but unlike a tax a user fee does not involve compulsion 
4a6c0307 One characteristic of user fees is that they reveal how much government programs are really worth to direct recipients in the most direct and meaningful way possible 
4a6c0308 [tongue_click] One of the strongest arguments that a government program is worthwhile occurs when it has a user fee and the fee covers costs 
4a6c0309 [tongue_click] The reverse is also true and that is one reason some *beneficiaries* oppose user fees 
4a6c030a The improved results stem largely from gold sales at the company\'s Gold Bar operations in Nevada where production began in January

4a6c0412 Mr\. Carlucci emphasized that it is preferable to keep a smaller force that is adequately paid and ready to fight than to have a larger force that isn\'t 
4a6c0413 It would be a disaster if we repeat the experience of the nineteen seventies where you keep the framework but hollow it out he said 
4a6c0414 In Afghanistan he adds people have stayed in the army because they need to feed their children and because they worry about their families 
4a6c0415 [tongue_click] They join offensives because the Soviets are at their backs with guns 
4a6c0416 Now that they know they haven\'t anyone either to protect them or threaten them it will have an effect on morale 
4a6c0417 But this reliance also raises the stakes in the Farmers race

4a6c041c Friday\'s volume after subtracting a big dividend capture trade was only moderate at around a hundred and fifty million shares 
4a6c041d Why this incredible diversion of effort to crimes that often are not clearly defined by statute and where identifiable victims are seldom found 
4a6c041e Maybe too many of today\'s prosecutors were influenced by the prevailing counterculture suspicions of middle class morality during their law school days 
4a6c041f [tongue_click] But another answer is simpler It is easier to extract plea bargains from traders with a mere mention of R\. I\. C\. O\. than from real felons

4a7c0205 Sears\'s merchandise group alone generated profit of seven hundred sixty five \.POINT seven million dollars in nineteen eighty five 
4a7c0206 Indeed analysts say that in the past Sears may have been hesitant to buy specialty stores because they won\'t quickly contribute to profit

4a7c020q Mr\. Shortell and Doctor Hughes say patient care may have been hurt by cost cutting in several areas such as hospital\'s slashing of nursing staffs 
4a7c020r That view is supported by the American Nursing Association which blames cost containment for *exacerbating* the current nursing shortage 
4a7c020s Many hospitals cut back on nurses in the early nineteen eighties and haven\'t been able to raise salaries enough to lure them back

4a7c040o I don\'t have anything to worry about the former investment banker says 
4a7c040p I have always followed the advice of my lawyer and accountants 
4a7c040q He says that he has cooperated in an inquiry by Florida officials but that he isn\'t aware the matter has been referred to the attorney general\'s office 
4a7c040r In any case he says Sport About\'s problems will be cured by the public offering and are commonplace in any rapidly growing franchise business 
4a7c040s But many clubs don\'t offer team sports at all 
4a7c040t This reflects a Germanic distaste for the idea of competition as a goal in itself and for the American penchant for turning practically everything into a contest 
4a7c040u Beauty pageants are rare here hostile takeovers are unknown in the business world and the government still fixes prices on many products and strictly regulates store hours 
4a7c040v You think that\'s weird 
4a7c040w Think again 
4a7c040x He\'s not alone 
4a7c040y But Eastern excluded a number of high traffic hub cities [misc_noise] from the special program which involves travel from September eleventh to December fifteenth

4a7c0410 In addition tickets must be purchased from August fifteenth to August twenty sixth 
4a7c0411 But the Bush family as a whole gets high marks on the stump 
4a7c0412 After Mr\. Bush lost to Kansas Senator Robert Dole in the Iowa caucus the family rushed to his rescue in New Hampshire 
4a7c0413 They had buried George Bush in the press recalls forty two year old George Bush Junior 
4a7c0414 It was time to resurrect him 
4a7c0415 We give a look like a generation before them lived here says Mr\. Marder 
4a7c0416 That\'s worth money 
4a7c0417 In the past three years alone the company has doubled its profits and tripled its staff he adds 
4a7c0418 Sales are still under twenty million dollars a year he says but they\'re headed up 
4a7c0419 It\'s kind of like eating peanuts isn\'t it said Mr\. Murphy 
4a7c041a Once you start it\'s tough to stop 
4a7c041b The umpteenth sounds of lead smacking metal and a rifle being cocked served as a quick answer to his question 
4a7c041c So what is Wall Street telling the queasy investors that hold shares in generic drug makers 
4a7c041d In essence Don\'t worry 
4a7c041e Take two aspirin and call me in a few years 
4a8c0201 The spokeswoman declined to identify possible uses for the company\'s cash other than the stock buyback 
4a8c0202 But Gary Schneider analyst with Bear Stearns and Company said he expects the company to extend the buyback beyond four million shares

4a8c0206 The percentage change is since year end 
4a8c0207 [tongue_click] Mr\. Berger claims the problem goes beyond simply recovering the cost of improvements 
4a8c0208 Because the Loft\'s Board\'s reimbursement allowances are so low he says banks won\'t make loans for the work 
4a8c0209 He says he financed his improvements by taking a second mortgage on another building that he owns 
4a8c020a The bottom line he says is that these buildings cannot be made safe under these rules 
4a8c020b The job will not get done 
4a8c020c Bond prices still are significantly lower than they were before President Reagan\'s surprise announcement Tuesday morning that Alan Greenspan will replace Paul Volcker as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board 
4a8c020d For example the Shearson Lehman index plummeted about forty points Tuesday and regained about twenty five points since then 
4a8c020e The latest thirty year Treasury bond which now yields eight \.POINT seven three \%PERCENT stood at eight \.POINT six two \%PERCENT late Monday 
4a8c020f Judge them on their personality judge them on anything you want the master of ceremonies tells the crowd

4a8c020h She\'s got tattoos and everything 
4a8c020i The fate of many A\. M\. C\. employees is uncertain 
4a8c020j Mr\. Iacocca said last month Chrysler might be able to keep half of A\. M\. C\.\'s employees 
4a8c020k Mr\. Cappy and Chrysler executives said they still don\'t know how many A\. M\. C\. workers will ultimately lose their jobs 
4a8c020l [tongue_click] U\. S\. utilities could also increase orders of foreign uranium ahead of any total import restrictions analysts say 
4a8c020m [tongue_click] Uranium from South Africa for example has already fallen under anti *apartheid* sanctions 
4a8c020n But last year said the Uranium Institute U\. S\. imports of South African uranium surged three hundred \%PERCENT to more than thirteen \.POINT two million pounds 
4a8c020o Almost sixty \%PERCENT of the deliveries took place in December nineteen eighty six the last month before the embargo took effect 
4a8c020p On the subject of computer reservations systems you hit the nail on the head 
4a8c020q [tongue_click] The nineteen eighty four rules governing the operation of C\. R\. S\. systems led to publication of unrealistic schedules by the airlines to get better screen positions 
4a8c020r This resulted in more delays and a lot of passenger frustration 
4a8c020s In retrospect it is clear that such government interference in C\. R\. S\. systems was counterproductive 
4a8c020t The continuing prospect of lower interest rates sent stock prices up sharply 
4a8c020u The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up twenty eight \.POINT eighteen points at one thousand nine hundred fifty eight \.POINT twenty two 
4a8c020v [tongue_click] Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled two hundred and eleven \.POINT nine million shares up from one hundred and sixty six \.POINT four million shares traded Thursday

4a8c0213 [tongue_click] The F\. B\. I\. meanwhile obtained two additional search warrants and is expected to obtain others this week 
4a8c0214 Law enforcement officials said the first formal charges in the inquiry could come late this summer or in the fall

4a8c0219 Chrysler\'s share of the U\. S\. car market slipped during the quarter of ten \.POINT seven \%PERCENT from eleven \.POINT three \%PERCENT 
4a8c021a The company is increasing its emphasis on trucks where its Jeeps and minivans are among the industry\'s strongest selling vehicles 
4a8c021b In June Chrysler sold more trucks than cars for the first time ever and that pattern may continue 
4a8c021c But the ride could be bumpy 
4a8c021d South Korean political unrest could curb market gains for one thing 
4a8c021e Any severe slump in the U\. S\. market could drag down the Korea Fund too 
4a8c021f Currency losses could also eat into returns though economists expect the South Korean . won will rise in value against the U\. S\. dollar 
4a8c021g And buying a fund for more than its portfolio value can be treacherous some an- analysts say 
4a8c0301 In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday Lear Siegler shares rose one dollar and twenty five cents to eighty three dollars

4a8c0304 The court based its ruling on a section of the law stating that the provision which could result in the highest price shall be applicable 
4a8c0305 The panel noted that since market prices were fairly high when the law was passed this provision set a ceiling above which regulated prices couldn\'t rise 
4a8c0306 Now with market prices low it serves as a price floor below which regulated prices can\'t drop it said 
4a8c0307 But on Tuesday Kidder Peabody\'s Jack Kirnan dropped Chrysler to a hold rating 
4a8c0308 [tongue_click] Vans and trucks are selling well he concedes but Chrysler\'s car sales have been very disappointing 
4a8c0309 He also figures Chrysler will take longer than expected to straighten out American Motors which it acquired Wednesday 
4a8c030a Instead Dayton Hudson\'s earnings have been depressed for more than a year by merchandising problems in its Mervyn\'s department store unit 
4a8c030b Analysts said the trouble stated with Mervyn\'s concentrating too much on opening new stores not enough on providing brand name merchandise 
4a8c030c Top management was slow to recognize the problems some analysts said 
4a8c030d And management has been too optimistic to predict the timing of a turnaround the analysts said 
4a8c030e On the outskirts of Johnstown Pennsylvania bulldozers scoot up and down the steep scooped out mountainside smoothing tons of dirt over mounds of garbage 
4a8c030f This is a landfill but no ordinary one 
4a8c030g At the site are state of the art environmental controls that are treating waste water detecting hazardous wastes and protecting against leaching of toxic substances 
4a8c030h Other representatives of public interest groups say that one of the biggest drawbacks of *reg* negs is the amount of work required usually several months 
4a8c030i It is extremely labor intensive says David Doniger a lawyer of Natural Resources Defense Council 
4a8c030j Pending legislation in Congress would give public interest groups some compensation for joining reg negs 
4a8c030k After deducting nonrecurring items the U\. S\. X\. steel unit nonetheless appeared to turn in one of <the> its most profitable quarters since the nineteen sixties 
4a8c030l On a per ton basis pretax profit doubled to about thirty six dollars from eighteen dollars in the third quarter 
4a8c030m However the performance fell far short of U\. S\. X\. Chairman David Roderick\'s prediction of fifty dollars plus per ton profit 
4a8c030n It is going to be very difficult to manage says a key player in the battle 
4a8c030o It is not a question of money because Generale de *Belgique* is rich now 
4a8c030p It\'s a problem of culture and style of management 
4a8c030q New campaign co chairman Laxalt may serve as intermediary with the Reagans even after eight years Bush still feels awkward talking to them 
4a8c030r Some strategists think Reagan\'s recent rash of patently partisan moves has been a mistake 
4a8c030s One explanation the desire of chief of staff Duberstein earlier viewed as a Dole supporter to integrate himself with Bush 
4a8c030t The public filings show that a film called Camro Associates acquired a one \%PERCENT nonvoting stake in the Seemala of nineteen eighty four 
4a8c030u Seemala disclosed the Camro stake in a public S\. E\. C\. filing that year Seemala didn\'t identify the investors in Camro 
4a8c030v [tongue_click] [loud_breath] But a separate nineteen eighty four filing by Camro in California identifies Camro as a general partnership made up of Mr\. Milken and twenty six other Drexel employees 
4a8c030w In deciding to leave Johnson and Swanson Mr\. Swanson said that he was looking for a smaller setting where he could offer more personalized legal counsel 
4a8c030x He said he will start a solo practice specializing in family business matters and advising trustees with a goal of expanding to as many as ten lawyers 
4a8c030y Both he and Mr\. Johnson said his departure is on friendly terms 
4a8c030z At the same time the region has become a mecca for developers its rate of population and job growth has slowed leaving some markets severely overbuilt 
4a8c0310 Such Sun Belt hot spots as Atlanta Nashville and Palm Beach County Florida are s- all struggling [loud_breath] 
4a8c0311 [tongue_click] In the latter the office vacancy rate has hit thirty two \%PERCENT and single family housing permits are forecast to drop seventeen \%PERCENT this year 
4a8c0312 Actually something rather like this does happen but only among certain elite groups that debate such detailed issues 
4a8c0313 And the depth and openness of this debate unquestionably is a major source of strength in our political system 
4a8c0314 The elites moreover articulate choices and call a nation to its ideals 
4a8c0315 Some of the most thoughtful students of democratic government believe that the upbringing and training of democratic political elites are the key to the system\'s success 
4a8c0316 [tongue_click] To be sure the deficit has declined in the past few years 
4a8c0317 But that decline is entirely the result of rising surplus in the Social Security trust fund 
4a8c0318 That money should be invested to help defray the future retirement costs of the baby boomers instead it is being used to paper over the deficit 
4a8c0319 That\'s yet another symptom of Mr\. Darman\'s national now now ism 
4a8c031a Pursuing a tip police seized the pair of the drugs with a street value in Munich of about three hundred thousand dollars

4a8c0401 There aren\'t many sellers around one broker said 
4a8c0402 He attributed much of the day\'s gain to a squeeze on market makers who didn\'t have a stock to sell 
4a8c0403 Several market makers were said to have been expecting the rise on Wall Street to end and had consequently been hoping to sell shares in London 
4a8c0404 Monday\'s sharp gain on the New York exchange and Tuesday\'s higher opening there caught them off guard 
4a8c0405 By yesterday Texaco\'s efforts to resolve the security issue had taken on the intensity of a corporate survival mission 
4a8c0406 A horde of Texaco litigators joined by the company\'s highest ranking executives had established a headquarters in Houston that one Texaco lawyer dubbed the war room 
4a8c0407 Throughout the day they were supplied with data from another team at Texaco headquarters in White Plains New York 
4a8c0408 I don\'t choose to live this way 
4a8c0409 Eating is my pastime and eating in Texas is an adventure 
4a8c040a But last fall my doctor told me to change my diet at least until I lowered my cholesterol level 
4a8c040b The recapitalization was proposed to thwart a takeover effort by British Printing and Communication Corporation 
4a8c040c The Oxford England publishing and printing concern controlled by Robert Maxwell filed a suit in federal court in New York this week to block the recapitalization 
4a8c040d A court victory would pave the way for Mr\. Maxwell to make a new offer for Harcourt 
4a8c040e Manga fits nicely into a life style that provides little time or opportunity to actually live one\'s fantasies 
4a8c040f For example students whose days actually are spent studying become comic book secret agents and soldiers 
4a8c040g And a frequent manga theme is a boy\'s love affair with his buxom teacher

4a8c040l He asked for a thirty million dollar loan even though Henderson is one of Wall Street\'s best capitalized specialist firms 
4a8c040m He was stunned by the response 
4a8c040n They stated they were in no position to make commitments Mr\. Maguire says 
4a8c040o Holders of about two or three dozen of the initial run of three hundred and fifty thousand ten dollar notes complained to the Reserve Bank that the Cook portrait vanished 
4a8c040p But examination of the allegedly faulty notes showed evidence of vigorous rubbing and willful damage a Reserve Bank *spokesman* says 
4a8c040q One complainer turned in a note that he said had shriveled when left in the sun on a car dashboard 
4a8c040r [tongue_click] The bank did its own dashboard test and proved it couldn\'t have happened

4a8c040w The normally plodding Sears is now copying Ward\'s specialty store scheme 
4a8c040x [tongue_click] On Wednesday it agreed to buy Western Auto Supply Company its third such venture into specialty retailing in recent months 
4a8c040y Later this year Sears plans to open self contained appliance and home shops to compete with Ward 
4a8c040z Sears is also following Ward\'s foray into selling more branded merchandise especially in appliances 
4a8c0410 And it is branching out of malls to open smaller neighborhood stores that could whittle away Ward\'s customer base 
4a8c0411 So far we\'ve found that federal employees have dealt with this issue [loud_breath] with a great deal of sensitivity and common sense 
4a8c0412 But there is a need for clarity 
4a8c0413 These guidelines will serve as *reassurance* to our managers 
4a8c0414 It has now been eleven nights since the arrest of Francis Seow *former* solicitor general and law society president in Singapore 
4a8c0415 While Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew\'s government has admitted holding Mr\. Seow it has kept him totally incommunicado 
4a8c0416 It has refused requests to see him from both his family and his lawyer 
4a8c0417 Daniel J\. Gilmartin was named president and chief operating officer of Frank\'s Nursery and Crafts Detroit a unit of this specialty retailer

4a8c041a His best pitch is his sinker and it\'s a great one 
4a8c041b But he\'s got to pinpoint it to make it effective and that\'s really difficult to do inning after inning and game after game said Dempsey 
4a8c041c He was able to stay in groove longer than any pitcher I\'ve seen 
4a8c041d It\'s study and attitude and concentration and who knows what else 
4a8c041e All I know is that wherever I put my glove tonight Thursday is mostly where the ball went 
4a8c041f There are also broker finders that get fees merely for matching borrowers and lenders of stock

4a9c0201 So while the subsidies are a great help most farmers could probably manage without them 
4a9c0202 Yet because farmers have so much influence politicians continue to support what is in effect a welfare system for farmers 
4a9c0203 By keeping food costs high the system hurts the more numerous but less powerful city dwellers 
4a9c0204 Mr\. Rifkin\'s modus operandi is the highly publicized lawsuit 
4a9c0205 He sues constantly usually in federal court in Washington D\. C\. to block the progress of biotechnology

4a9c020a The right wing underworld isn\'t always on the side of the landowner as the attacks on the Sumitomo companies suggest 
4a9c020b A year ago Sumitomo Realty received a bomb threat at its Tokyo headquarters and Mr\. Ando the chairman found a cardboard box burning on his doorstep

4a9c020s Last December the U\. N\. didn\'t attempt to solicit bids 
4a9c020t It simply extended its contract with National Carting 
4a9c020u Soliciting bids in this particular industry is not the way to go a U\. N\. spokesman says implying that it is futile 
4a9c020v The impact will be enormous 
4a9c020w The Republicans\' strongest case against the Democratic nominee his naivete on national security issues will disappear 
4a9c020x The suspicion of a selection based entirely on political [<door_slam] instead of substantive grounds will be undercut 
4a9c020y And a message that the current vice president is largely irrelevant will be strongly delivered 
4a9c020z The public findings show that a firm called Camro Associates acquired a one \%PERCENT nonvoting stake in Seemala in nineteen eighty four 
4a9c0210 Seemala disclosed the Camro stake in a public S\. E\. C\. filing that year Seemala didn\'t identify the investors in Camro

4a9c0212 Even after finding a buyer completing a foreclosure sale is hardly routine 
4a9c0213 Brokers at Merrill Lynch Realty recall a sale that was delayed for a month by a one million dollar Internal Revenue Service lien on the property 
4a9c0214 Another sale was delayed when the lender discovered that the owner had died between the time the property was posted for foreclosure and the foreclosure was completed 
4a9c0215 [tongue_click] We were at the closing table when this all came out says Wanda Hutchins the Merrill Lynch agent 
4a9c0216 Invalid foreclosures are one of the biggest problems we have 
4a9c0217 Mr\. Smilow said that the company won\'t have to sell any additional assets to finance a new buy out

4a9c021d People familiar with the situation say talks between Goldman Sachs and the S\. E\. C\. haven\'t begun yet nor have talks between Mr\. Freeman and the S\. E\. C\. 
4a9c021e And an attorney for the firm Lawrence Pedowitz maintains that Goldman itself was blameless in Mr\. Freeman\'s wrongdoing 
4a9c021f The firm had state of the art compliance policies and procedures in effect at the time of the incident Mr\. Pedowitz says 
4a9c021g I don\'t believe they were in any respect [<door_slam] inadequate

4a9c0302 We\'re trying to urge the entire industry to stabilize prices so that they don\'t fluctuate as much as the dollar says spokesman Neil Martin 
4a9c0303 Even so some prices those for many luxury hotels in Italy and France for example have been soaring 
4a9c0304 In the past Filipinos in many rural areas preferred the disciplined terror of the N\. P\. A\. to the random excesses of the country\'s military 
4a9c0305 With the change of government last year a mild improvement in military behavior and the detection of the Mindanao slaughters some Filipinos are changing their minds 
4a9c0306 Diplomats and political analysts say they don\'t know if the trend . presages significant popular resistance to the Communists or just additional turmoil in the Philippine countryside 
4a9c0307 The S\. E\. C\. sanctions against the firm and Mr\. Blinder were handed down in December

4a9c030h Democrats like House Majority Leader James Wright and Majority Whip Tony Coelho believe they can convince Americans that President Reagan has been too kind to the rich 
4a9c030i How that political statement is received by the American people and how it plays in the nineteen eighty eight elections could determine the nature of future tax increases

4a9c030u It\'s a situation where we are learning our way with the Allante the spokesman said 
4a9c030v The car is doing the things that we want it to do for us as far as getting visibility for the division and being an image car 
4a9c030w Since it\'s been a new entity for Cadillac and our dealers we weren\'t quite sure what the actual sales volume would be 
4a9c030x Agfa Gevaert is a Ridgefield Park New Jersey maker of photographic equipment and supplies that is owned by Bayer A\. G\. of West Germany 
4a9c030y Agfa Gevaert announced last week it would seek to acquire the eighty nine \%PERCENT of Matrix it didn\'t already own for ten dollars a share 
4a9c030z Matrix said at that time that its board reviewed the offer but the results of that review weren\'t announced 
4a9c0310 The advertisement announcing the tender offer says a merger agreement was reached between the two firms last week 
4a9c0311 And it doesn\'t appear that cable owners will resist the change 
4a9c0312 A spokesman for the National Cable Television Association said We don\'t oppose the proposal in principle 
4a9c0313 We take the position that the more people in the cable market the better 
4a9c0314 Many people criticize ads that glorify junk 
4a9c0315 Some singled out as contradictory a cooking oil ad telling people how to cut down on cholesterol but featuring fried chicken and french fries 
4a9c0316 It\'s also dishonest some said to omit information or hide it in small print 
4a9c0317 [tongue_click] They noted that ads for high fiber cereals neglect to mention their salt and sugar content 
4a9c0318 [tongue_click] The Micro Channel is our strategy said Bill Lowe the head of I\. B\. M\.\'s P\. C\. division 
4a9c0319 We\'ve been consistently saying that since April nineteen eighty seven when the P\. S\. two line was introduced 
4a9c031a [tongue_click] If we kept changing directions I could see people questioning that 
4a9c031b We give a look like a generation before them lived here says Mr\. Marder 
4a9c031c That\'s worth money 
4a9c031d In the past three years alone the company has doubled its profits and tripled its staff he adds 
4a9c031e Sales are still under twenty million dollars a year he says but they\'re headed up 
4a9c0401 On the Big Board volume rose to two hundred twenty \.POINT five million shares from one hundred sixty eight \.POINT six million Thursday 
4a9c0402 But the activity was less than on previous triple witching days and much of the [<door_slam] trading was packed into the opening and closing minutes of the session 
4a9c0403 More than thirty one million shares changed hands in the final minute [door_slam] 
4a9c0404 Several factors contribute to British investors\' regard for these service companies 
4a9c0405 U\. S\. and British accounting standards differ for the good will arising from acquisitions yielding higher reported earnings for British companies 
4a9c0406 Some analysts suggest U\. K\. investors have few high growth industries to choose from and so look favorably on service companies 
4a9c0407 That leaves retail brokerage firms with a stark choice 
4a9c0408 They can move onto the institutional firms\' turf and fight for a top spot in investment banking 
4a9c0409 Or they can settle onto the second rank of the securities business perhaps forever 
4a9c040a Assets of two hundred general purpose funds rose one \.POINT one five billion dollars to seventy \.POINT three six billion dollars 
4a9c040b Assets of ninety three broker dealer funds fell three hundred sixty one \.POINT seven million dollars to one hundred eight \.POINT zero one billion dollars 
4a9c040c Assets of one hundred three institutional funds fell five hundred thirty one \.POINT one million dollars to sixty six \.POINT one three billion dollars 
4a9c040d The rivals have disputed each other\'s circulation claims for years 
4a9c040e According to recent industry statistics the Post\'s daily circulation is about three hundred ten thousand the Chronicle\'s approximates four hundred twenty five thousand 
4a9c040f The Post claims to have roughly forty \%PERCENT of the Houston advertising market 
4a9c040g You didn\'t have people hitting the silks on this said John Keefe an analyst for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc\. New York 
4a9c040h You had to expect higher redemptions given all the difficulty in the market 
4a9c040i But it was contained fairly well 
4a9c040j The purchasing managers sounded more optimistic than most economists in several recent surveys 
4a9c040k [door_slam>] Many economists fear the stock market\'s collapse on October nineteenth will make shoppers more cautious especially on such major purchases as autos and homes 
4a9c040l Some also fear the stock market\'s woes may persuade companies to postpone [<door_slam] capital spending plans until a clearer picture of the economy\'s health emerges 
4a9c040m Nevertheless most economists still contend there is no evidence of a recession coming anytime soon 
4a9c040n [tongue_click] To punish currency speculators the government is allowing people to exchange a maximum of ten million old cordobas 
4a9c040o Anything over that can\'t be exchanged but must be deposited in a bank account 
4a9c040p The moves took effect yesterday 
4a9c040q Today\'s games rely on computer generated images 
4a9c040r As computer chips have become more powerful the images have become more complicated and vivid but still aren\'t realistic 
4a9c040s Under development however are games in which the players interact with videotape scenes 
4a9c040t The Japanese firms including ourselves have been good members of the primary dealer community said Toshio Mori chairman of Nikko\'s U\. S\. unit 
4a9c040u We are not a disturbing force in this market and I don\'t see any advantage in kicking three Japanese firms out from being primary dealers 
4a9c040v What is the advantage for U\. S\. markets and the U\. S\. economy 
4a9c040w Equicor . was launched in nineteen eighty six by Equitable and Hospital Corporation to provide employee benefit programs and to manage health care products for corporations 
4a9c040x After posting two years of losses it broke even in the first quarter of this year 
4a9c040y Executives of both Equitable and Hospital Corporation said they expect the venture to be profitable this year 
4a9c040z Estimates of the makeup of the feedlot population vary widely 
4a9c0410 Most analysts expect the government to report that the number of young cattle placed on feedlots fell in July for the second consecutive month from a year earlier 
4a9c0411 However some expect a rise 
4a9c0412 In any case a return to market discipline is inevitable 
4a9c0413 Financial history has witnessed a thousand booms and busts 
4a9c0414 Within recent memory we have seen the junk equities of the sixties the heated Third World lending of the seventies and the thrift crisis of the eighties 
4a9c0415 These problems of the recent past pale in scope next to the pervasiveness and [door_slam>] total dollars involved in the current craze 
4a9c0416 If the participants in this craze awaken now the correction may still be within tolerable limits for the country 
4a9c0417 If not all of America will pay the penalty because the debt is huge and widely held and the banking structure\'s integrity would be at stake 
4a9c0418 One stumbling block to increased competition is the vertical integration and cross ownership in the industry 
4a9c0419 Cable systems often have demanded a stake in the channels they transmit 
4a9c041a [door_slam] An entrepreneur is reluctant to start an alternative cable system if he knows he will find it difficult to gain access to programming 
4a9c041b Quite possibly some of the antitrust aspects of these arrangements deserve a look so it can be -(de)termined whether they act to further [<door_slam] inhibit competition in the industry 
4aac0201 Mr\. Davidoff couldn\'t be reached for comment 
4aac0202 His lawyer Paul Rooney said Mr\. 
4aac0203 Davidoff deeply regrets his involvement in the Boesky company\'s failure to remain at all times in compliance with the Securities and Exchange Commission\'s net capital rules 
4aac0204 Mr\. Rooney emphasized that Mr\. Davidoff wasn\'t charged with insider trading 
4aac0205 Willful violation of the capital rule carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar fine 
4aac0206 Stock exchanges commodity markets many banks and some businesses will be closed in the U\. S\. Monday in observance of Washington\'s Birthday 
4aac0207 Federal offices will be closed and there won\'t be any regular mail deliveries 
4aac0208 [tongue_click] Many state and local government offices also will be closed 
4aac0209 They have put in a lot of money but is that enough 
4aac020a Nobody knows said Mr\. Bray 
4aac020b In October we thought there would be enough but between October and now it\'s proven to be not enough 
4aac020c Who knows how much it will be 
4aac020d Purolator jumped five and a half to forty and three eighths 
4aac020e Emery Air Freight began a forty dollar a share tender offer for eighty three \%PERCENT of Purolator\'s common

4aac020g Now the issue is in the House\'s lap 
4aac020h The temporary ban on new banking powers is a provision in the Senate version of a bill to recapitalize the insolvent Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp\. 
4aac020i The House F\. S\. L\. I\. C\. measure doesn\'t have any other provisions 
4aac020j Mitsubishi has an influential name which is one reason for the reputation dealers said 
4aac020k But it also benefited from having launched the bonds just ahead of a number of scheduled deals by other Japanese banks getting into the market before overcrowding takes place 
4aac020l Because the bank convertibles generally appeal to a more conservative market segment they haven\'t been affected by the problems of the equity warrant sector 
4aac020m To do the job S\. C\. I\. has assembled what analysts call a crack management team 
4aac020n President Eugene Sapp runs the company on a day to day basis and he does so in a no frills atmosphere 
4aac020o For example company cars planes and country club memberships are taboo 
4aac020p Mr\. Patrick and anyone else giving the matter serious thought knows that regulatory bodies can\'t manage enterprises hard as they try 
4aac020q Even the appointed managers of unregulated companies in competitive industries have a hard time controlling costs 
4aac020r And they don\'t have a perverse incentive to do the opposite 
4aac020s Following the Wilson affair the panel did conduct several staff inquiries in reaction to news stories 
4aac020t One yielded reprimands of Reps\. 
4aac020u Daniel Crane Republican Illinois and Gerry Studds Democrat Massachusetts in nineteen eighty three for sexual affairs with House pages 
4aac020v Rep\. George Hansen Republican Idaho drew a reprimand in nineteen eighty four after a felony conviction for falsifying his financial disclosures 
4aac020w American Standard said it is very pleased by Black and Decker\'s withdrawal 
4aac020x It declined to elaborate 
4aac020y If Black and Decker should resume its pursuit sources close to the American Standard said the company is prepared to resist again 
4aac020z His inability to recover from October\'s market plunge was traced to a hostile bid from two f- rival financiers for Bell Resources Limited which is controlled by Bell Group 
4aac0210 The bid forced Mr\. Holmes a Court to call off a proposed merger of the Bell companies 
4aac0211 That was the turning point said Darryl Smalley a director at the Perth brokerage Hartley Poynton Limited 
4aac0212 As a result the government is talking of higher farm prices 
4aac0213 But higher farm prices would add to an already steep inflation rate 
4aac0214 So Beijing officials reportedly talk of tying wages to inflation an idea reminiscent of the wage indexation tried in some Latin American nations several years ago with disastrous results 
4aac0215 The Army wants to stop buying the trucks which are designed to haul up to ten tons of ammunition mortars and rockets to some prospective battlefield 
4aac0216 It wants to concentrate instead on developing a new sixteen ton truck 
4aac0217 But Mr\. Aspin won\'t let that happen 
4aac0218 At his behest and against the Pentagon\'s wishes Congress continues to pour money into the truck program 
4aac0219 But when the subject is farming he can\'t mask his disappointment 
4aac021a I thought I\'d be in a heck of a lot better position by now he says 
4aac021b Before the drought I thought we had a good shot at a good year 
4aac021c The plywood and insulation maker said it declared a dividend of one share of a new issue of preferred stock for each of its common shares outstanding 
4aac021d The rights give holders the ability to purchase company shares at a steep discount in various hostile takeover circumstances 
4aac021e The distribution is payable to holders of record September nine and expires August thirty one nineteen ninety eight 
4aac0301 Power Financial is a financial services concern that is sixty nine \%PERCENT held by Power Corp\. of Canada a Montreal based holding company 
4aac0302 Montreal Trustco is the parent of Montreal Trust Company 
4aac0303 A Canadian trust company is similar to a U\. S\. savings and loan association 
4aac0304 That decision came easily 
4aac0305 Now he\'s working amid the metal folding chairs in his transition office in the austere chamber of the Senate Education Committee 
4aac0306 His first budget must go to the printer two days after he\'s inaugurated 
4aac0307 However one source close to the companies said he wouldn\'t rule out the possibility of Limited buying I\. Magnin 
4aac0308 Limited Chairman Leslie H\. Wexner has said he is interested in operating a specialty department store 
4aac0309 Limited operates such stores as Limited Limited Express Lane Bryant Henri Bendel and Victoria\'s Secret 
4aac030a Bullion dealers say the five houses fixing the gold price have to respond to the needs of the market and requirements of British financial legislation 
4aac030b As a group the five bullion firms transact less business than outside market makers several London bullion traders say 
4aac030c Unlike gold futures markets in New York and Chicago however the London gold market doesn\'t publish trading statistics 
4aac030d Mr\. Icahn couldn\'t be reached for comment and it was unclear what intentions he might ultimately harbor toward Tenneco 
4aac030e His position in the company is understood to be one of more than twenty similar stakes he has amassed in a variety of concerns 
4aac030f As previously reported he also controls an eleven \.POINT four \%PERCENT stake in U\. S\. X\. Corporation a Pittsburgh based oil and steel concern 
4aac030g In Amsterdam stocks closed lower in volatile trading 
4aac030h Selected issues ended off their intraday lows though after Wall Street\'s lower opening proved less severe than some Dutch forecasters anticipated dealers said 
4aac030i Volatile trading throughout the session *produced* wide price fluctuations as Dutch institutions bargain hunted while overseas investors tended to sell shares 
4aac030j The announcement would cap a highly publicized search for a possible new home 
4aac030k It also would represent a major victory for New York City which has been fighting to keep companies from fleeing the city 
4aac030l N\. B\. C\. had been considering moving some or all of its facilities to New Jersey 
4aac030m Fred M\. Gibbons thirty eight resigned as Software Publishing\'s chairman and succeeds Ms\. Bedke as president 
4aac030n He also was named chief executive officer a post which wasn\'t filled when Mr\. Gibbons stepped down from both positions in August 
4aac030o Since then the two executives had been sharing day to day operational management Mr\. Gibbons said 
4aac030p Mr\. McMillin said the two retailing units could fetch between three hundred and fifty million dollars and four hundred and fifty million dollars 
4aac030q But speculation in retailing circles put the potential price tag at about two hundred million dollars to two hundred and fifty million dollars 
4aac030r It\'s the worst time to sell a retailer said one industry executive 
4aac030s They missed the high in August when publicly traded specialty retailers were selling at multiples as high as thirty five times earnings 
4aac030t Now they\'re trading at ten to twelve times earnings 
4aac030u And according to Texaco it could all add up to securities law violations by Mr\. Icahn 
4aac030v To announce that you\'re in serious negotiations with a serious partner if you\'re not is a serious violation Mr\. *Boies* said 
4aac030w Mr\. Icahn however ticked off numerous details about the extent of his negotiations with the third parties 
4aac030x These details he said were indications that talks were serious as far as he was concerned 
4aac030y Unconvinced the Harrisburg City Council in April passed an ordinance requiring local employers with ten or more employees to give up to twelve weeks of unpaid parental leave 
4aac030z Harrisburg is believed to be the first U\. S\. city to pass such a statute and it is much stricter than any state legislation 
4aac0310 For instance Wisconsin passed a parental leave law in April which provides only six weeks of unpaid leave and exempts companies with fewer than fifty employees 
4aac0311 Meritor also joined the Federal Home Loan Bank system last month 
4aac0312 It can borrow intermediate term funds from the bank system which would allow Meritor to more closely match its assets and liabilities 
4aac0313 Its deposits are still insured by Federal *Deposit* Insurance Corp\. 
4aac0314 Helped by Wednesday\'s Wall Street rally and improved commodity prices stock prices posted robust gains in Sydney 
4aac0315 Turnover remained thin 
4aac0316 An early spurt of domestic led demand drove prices to their best levels during the first hour of activity 
4aac0317 They drifted for the remainder of the session and closed just short of their peaks 
4aac0318 People close to the situation say the company and pilots\' union were hoping to hammer out an agreement that other labor groups would find acceptable 
4aac0319 But Mr\. Schroeder\'s letter said the machinists will neither accept a fait accompli nor be stampeded into unnecessary or imprudent action 
4aac031a He also said the machinists\' union will oppose any transaction that doesn\'t guarantee job protection for its members 
4aac031b In Houston a Coastal spokesman said the fight isn\'t over 
4aac031c We anticipate asking for a rehearing or appealing to the Supreme Court the spokesman said 
4aac031d He added We were quite surprised by the reversal 
4aac031e We thought we had a solid case 
4aac0401 Mr\. Regan asked yesterday whether he plans to resign told reporters No absolutely not 
4aac0402 The former Merrill Lynch and Company chairman added further that if I\'m ineffective or not helping this president obviously I would resign 
4aac0403 But in this case I don\'t feel I have any *particular* culpability 
4aac0404 Four other companies are vying to share the booster rocket business with Morton Hercules Inc\. Aerojet General Corp\. United Technologies Corp\. and Atlantic Research Corp\. 
4aac0405 A Hercules representative contended at the hearing that the competition could lower the cost of the booster rocket as much as one third 
4aac0406 An official of United Technologies\' Chemical Systems division said the company has studied ways of terminating the booster rockets in the event of a malfunction

4aac040i But analysts say manufacturing is improving 
4aac040j Another barometer of the economy\'s future course called the long leading composite is compiled by Columbia University\'s Center for International Business Cycle Research 
4aac040k The Columbia composite has signaled recessions on the average by fourteen months a somewhat longer lead time than for the Commerce index 
4aac040l It is of no surprise accordingly that the Columbia composite reached a peak before the Commerce index in July 
4aac040m Since then the composite has fallen with little interruption 
4aac040n Without such decisive action by the Federal Reserve financial obligations to those who had properly hedged their portfolios would have been broken 
4aac040o Unlike the old days the ensuing scramble for cash would have focused on securities firms rather than the banking system 
4aac040p The Fed properly shifted its emphasis to avert a breakdown in the payments system associated with securities transactions 
4aac040q The company said life insurance and property and casualty insurance operations had record first quarter results 
4aac040r It said that finance unit earnings rose forty one \%PERCENT and that its leasing unit had record results because of high utilization rates 
4aac040s Consumer lending along with tax and title operations declined reflecting lagging but now improving real estate sales the company said 
4aac040t Analysts say there is a strong chance that Kao will take advantage of an earlier U\. S\. acquisition

4aac0418 Scientists in general must come to terms with their reliance on Congress for financial support 
4aac0419 Space scientists now compete for attention with other big science projects such as mapping the human genome or the super collider 
4aac041a In the process already established scientists in basic research feel slighted 
4aac041b Witness the recent dispute over continuing N\. I\. H\.\'s artificial heart program 
4aac041c But the lawmakers actually spent only about five hundred million dollars of the money authorized under the legislation this *fiscal* year 
4aac041d And so far hardly any of the promised additional two \.POINT three billion dollars has been forthcoming

4abc0201 A smaller market share still means substantial growth when the asset pool is vastly expanded notes George Collins president of T\. Rowe Price 
4abc0202 Nonetheless the firm has been paying more attention to the consumer aspects of the business 
4abc0203 Retail clients currently account for about fifty seven \%PERCENT of the total twenty two billion dollars of assets under management at T\. Rowe Price 
4abc0204 In nineteen seventy eight retail business accounted for about thirty five \%PERCENT of the firm\'s assets

4abc020f Net nineteen eighty six sales after redemptions were one hundred forty eight \.POINT eight billion dollars 
4abc020g A spot survey here showed that many executives think both gross and net sales for the industry this year may range from flat to down thirty \%PERCENT from last year 
4abc020h Although substantial new taxes are unlikely this year the current debate is important 
4abc020i Democrats like House Majority Leader James Wright and Majority Whip Tony Coelho believe they can convince Americans that President Reagan has been too kind to the rich 
4abc020j How that political statement is received by the American people and how it plays in the nineteen eighty eight elections could determine the nature of future tax increases 
4abc020k L\. T\. V\. has said repeatedly since its filing that it would fight any creditor move to either reorganize the unit separately or force its sale 
4abc020l Creditors on the other hand have discussed the idea almost since the day of L\. T\. V\.\'s filing

4abc0215 But nothing is imminent 
4abc0216 While the federal government bemoans the deteriorating quality of U\. S\. education states such as South Carolina have been acting to turn the situation around 
4abc0217 New Jersey for instance has launched alternative certification for teachers opening up the field to many talented people with no formal education training 
4abc0218 Minnesota allows students to attend any public school in the state that will have them taking money away from schools that lose kids 
4abc0219 Massachusetts is piloting a school based management program that takes power away from central district offices and gives teachers more authority in staffing and instructional methods 
4abc021a The seeds of NatWest\'s investment banking problems were sown months before the deregulation of Britain\'s financial markets 
4abc021b Rivals such as Barclays and S\. G\. Warburg Group P\. L\. C\. assembled powerhouse conglomerates of brokerage trading and fixed income securities firms 
4abc021c But NatWest then pushing to dislodge Barclays as Britain\'s top commercial bank was more reluctant to commit itself to a similar position in investment banking

4acc040j Before Friday it seemed that only an unexpected break in the Delaware court case could have extracted Henley from the dilemma it now faces 
4acc040k Thus the case was closely watched 
4acc040l But it also raised important issues of corporate law 
4acc040m The most important of these was a contention that Santa Fe\'s board acted illegally last December when it lowered the threshhold for a shareholder rights plan to twenty \%PERCENT 
4acc040n Previously the rights or poison pill were triggered automatically only if fifty \%PERCENT of the stock were in hostile hands 
4acc040o The legitimate right of government to prescribe penalties for fraud is well understood in law when a good or service is involved 
4acc040p Laws against fraud should be no less applicable to plant closings or mass layoffs 
4acc040q In short government should seek to ensure that employers live up to their legal obligations and should provide for legal remedies when they do not

4adc0202 Mellon\'s interim chief executive Nathan Pearson told shareholders at the bank\'s annual meeting Monday that he expects Mellon to return to profitability this year 
4adc0203 But several profitable Mellon businesses including a trust operations and data processing could be swamped by continued losses from energy and real estate loans 
4adc0204 And yet this hapless fellow had the guts to sue his father and the ambition to grab for control of the corporation that bears his name 
4adc0205 He is most elusive 
4adc0206 In nineteen eighty two he toured New York\'s takeover houses blithely chatting about Getty\'s problems 
4adc0207 Was he naively seeking advice or was he subtly showing that he was willing to go outside the firm for allies to oust the current management 
4adc0208 Two desirable results arise from placing corporate governance decisions as close to the shareholders as possible 
4adc0209 First the decision makers closest to the issue are likely to have the best information with which to make decisions 
4adc020a Second the opportunity arises for experimentation with different rules of corporate governance 
4adc020b Mr\. Trump wasn\'t available for comment yesterday 
4adc020c Industry sources have disputed his claim that he holds that large a Golden Nugget stake as well as any takeover threat

4adc020e He wasn\'t available for comment yesterday 
4adc020f What\'s more a further drop in the dollar could have the very result Mr\. Baker seeks to avoid higher interest rates 
4adc020g In order to keep persuading foreign investors to hold cheaper dollars the Federal Reserve must keep U\. S\. interest rates higher than those abroad 
4adc020h An even weaker dollar could require higher rates 
4adc020i Certainly government controlled television has had a role in that transformation 
4adc020j Mr\. Roh\'s strategies say Koreans have ten times more television sets some ten million than in the last presidential elections in nineteen seventy one 
4adc020k Thus a recent Kim Young Sam rally that attracted a crowd of one million at his home town of Pusan was a secondary news item on the nightly news

4adc020z And there\'s tremendous competition for attention not only from other magazines but from items like candy tobacco and razor blades Mr\. Bishop adds 
4adc0210 That\'s why magazine executives say covers have to reach out and grab buyers 
4adc0211 Fed officials are particularly pleased with the dollar\'s new found strength 
4adc0212 They see it as a vote of confidence in their conduct of monetary policy it reduces the threat of inflation and eases pressure for further interest rate increases 
4adc0213 Economist David Hale says the dollar\'s strength is dimming the prospect of an eighty nine recession as well as an eighty eight financial crisis

4adc0316 In the first week of January the world central banks intervened massively to support the dollar and backed up the interventions with adjustments in basic monetary policy

4aec0405 And most analysts expect the earnings growth to continue albeit at a more modest rate in nineteen eighty eight 
4aec0406 Macho nonsense of this type about world trade in the nation\'s highest deliberative body helps explain why confidence in the U\. S\. dollar has not been rock solid of late

4afc020x [tongue_click] Frankfurt share prices retreated across the board in moderately active trading as the day earlier decline on Wall Street and weaker dollar prompted widespread profit taking

4afc021e The suggested retail price for Cinderella is twenty six ninety nine and for E\. T\. twenty four ninety five

4afc0311 May I ask a question about 
4afc0312 [tongue_click] While former executive branch officials face jail for non crimes [tongue_click] Congress is abusing the judicial process in seeking immunity from libel suits 
4afc0313 [tongue_click] The U\. S\. Court of Appeals for the D\. C\. Circuit held last November that congressmen can be sued for statements made outside Congress 
4afc0314 Lawyer Steven Ross whose boss is House Speaker Jim Wright appealed to the entire circuit with no success 
4afc0315 [tongue_click] But Robert Bork has left the court so Mr\. Ross will try again 
4afc0316 The circuit has never granted a second try but Mr\. Ross seems to think it\'s worth another shot 
4afc0317 [tongue_click] The clincher critics say is the comparison with Fords built after nineteen eighty 
4afc0318 [tongue_click] For them the death count is down as much as fivefold and more like other cars\' 
4afc0319 For nineteen eighty and later vehicles Ford redesigned certain transmission parts

4afc031f [tongue_click] If Congress doesn\'t act soon the Treasury won\'t be able to issue new long term bonds until early next year 
4afc0401 [tongue_click] The lack of market depth yesterday enabled several large buy orders to spark the dollar rally 
4afc0402 [tongue_click] One New York trader said he witnessed the currency\'s [<door_slam] value jump as his bank executed a purchase order for two hundred fifty million in several chunks 
4afc0403 When there are very few players that kind of order will move the market [<door_slam] said the trader who asked not to be identified [other_mouth_sound] 
4afc0404 [tongue_click] The biggest danger economists say is a free fall of the dollar 
4afc0405 That would force the U\. S\. to raise interest rates to attract the foreign capital needed to finance its current account deficit and indirectly its budget deficit 
4afc0406 Higher rates in turn could plunge the U\. S\. and possibly the world into a recession that could threaten the international financial system 
4afc0407 The review committee tries to offer a menu of small medium and large capitalization stocks 
4afc0408 Some of its most successful picks were quite small companies when first recommended 
4afc0409 Money managers minding billion dollar portfolios on the other hand often avoid smaller stocks because they can\'t purchase [loud_breath] [door_slam] a significant stake without affecting the price 
4afc040a [tongue_click] Some experts say that because of sweeping technological changes the telecommunications industry couldn\'t be re regulated even if people wanted 
4afc040b But the continuing decontrol in this area also shows that the regulatory resurgence is selective 
4afc040c While rules are revived to deal with publicized concerns such as air and rail safety the *government* pullback continues in such areas as consumer protection and antitrust enforcement 
4afc040d Two desirable results arise from placing corporate governance decisions as close to the shareholders as possible 
4afc040e [tongue_click] First the decision makers closest to the issues are likely to have the best information with which to make decisions 
4afc040f [tongue_click] Second the opportunity arises for experimentation with different rules of corporate governance 
4afc040g [tongue_click] The *Iran* Contra committee ended its hearings yesterday in a torrent of members\' speeches about lies and deceit 
4afc040h [tongue_click] Congress now turns to its rewrite of the Gramm Rudman law which has targeted the fiscal nineteen eighty eight deficit of one hundred eight billion 
4afc040i The target will be raised because members it seems are not prepared to keep the spending cut promises made when it was set 
4afc040j [tongue_click] Nevertheless some analysts say the Fed already may be tightening credit slightly 
4afc040k They point to recent increases in the federal funds rate which is the rate on reserves that banks lend each other overnight 
4afc040l [tongue_click] The funds rate averaged about seven and five eighths \%PERCENT yesterday and Tuesday up from an average of seven \.POINT four three \%PERCENT in the week ended October seventh 
4afc040m [tongue_click] These analysts argue that the increase was engineered by the Fed 
4afc040n Brazil unilaterally stopped paying interest on an estimated sixty seven billion of foreign bank debt last February twentieth 
4afc040o It cited weakened foreign exchange and gold reserves 
4afc040p [tongue_click] Since then its medium *term* and long term foreign bank debt has climbed to more [door_slam>] than seventy billion dollars including interest arrears

4afc040w [tongue_click] A merger with Macy which is roughly half the size of Federated could be attractive to the larger retailer\'s executives 
4afc040x Macy\'s smaller size could leave the Federated officers with operating power in a combined concern 
4afc040y And feelings at Federated have run higher against Campeau which surprised the company with a hostile bid last month [loud_breath] 
4afc040z However Campeau\'s bid is all cash and the Macy bid isn\'t 
4afc0410 Institutionalized auditing would also help reduce tax evasion 
4afc0411 If accounting becomes institutionalized it would enable the state to collect taxes more efficiently says Hakan Once a manager of Arthur Young\'s office in Istanbul 
4afc0412 [tongue_click] Nearly half of all taxable revenue goes untaxed according to Turkey\'s federal tax authority 
4afc0413 But American Express insists it has no intention of doing that 
4afc0414 The answer is no 
4afc0415 Not while I\'m here says Edwin Cooperman president of American Express\'s consumer card group 
4afc0416 [tongue_click] The same mentality affected the physical structures of the stores Mr\. Garcia said 
4afc0417 He owns thirty seven Burger Kings in Florida but he refuses to put up the building that is currently approved by Burger King

4agc0201 The computer also can display a pattern showing how people normally place the tongue to produce say an s\. sound 
4agc0202 A deaf person can then try to match the pattern by placing the tongue against the electronic palate 
4agc0203 With careful coaching and trial and error children like Miss Gilroy can learn how to make sounds that require placing the tongue against the roof of the mouth 
4agc0204 Holiday was also vulnerable because it hadn\'t much changed and consumers had 
4agc0205 They were more sophisticated and widely traveled 
4agc0206 They demanded more and instead of getting better many Holiday Inns had gone downhill 
4agc0207 Some were quite vehement in resisting any change 
4agc0208 If a company did this I wouldn\'t follow them anymore said one New York analyst 
4agc0209 Issuers of abbreviated annual reports are really showing contempt for the typical shareholder said another 
4agc020a The U\. S\. cotton industry is cost competitive with the major producing countries but ninety five \%PERCENT of foreign cotton production is subsidized

4agc020d International Lease Finance Corporation is offering five hundred shares of transferable preferred stock at one hundred thousand dollars each 
4agc020e The shares carry an initial annual dividend rate of four \.POINT six two five \%PERCENT 
4agc020f A new rate will be set June eighth and every forty nine days thereafter through a Dutch auction said Salomon Brothers Incorporated head underwriter 
4agc020g In a Dutch auction the shares are bought and sold at face value only the dividend rate is subject to change

4agc020s But Mr\. Trotman said Mr\. el Sayed isn\'t involved in the Trans Resources bid 
4agc020t But Westin has shown unspectacular albeit steady earnings in recent years as competition has heated up in the luxury hotel market 
4agc020u In nineteen eighty six it had operating earnings of fifty five million dollars about four million dollars less than it earned in nineteen eighty two 
4agc020v Revenue in nineteen eighty six was four hundred ninety one \.POINT six million dollars 
4agc020w Chairman Greenspan inherited from his predecessor Paul Volcker a monetary policy that had been quite erratic 
4agc020x The Fed allowed the money supply to v- grow very rapidly through nineteen eighty six 
4agc020y Then in early nineteen eighty seven the central bank tightened up sharply 
4agc020z For the first few months of this year I thought policy might be all right says Milton Friedman of the Hoover Institution 
4agc0210 You could say that it was offsetting the excessively easy policy of nineteen eighty six 
4agc0211 But the restraint continued and in early October before the market crash Mr\. Friedman predicted a recession would start in six to nine months 
4agc0212 The clincher critics say is the comparison with Fords built after nineteen eighty 
4agc0213 For them the death count is down as much as fivefold and more like other cars\' 
4agc0214 For nineteen eighty and later vehicles Ford redesigned certain transmission parts 
4agc0215 Among the seventy eight bond funds tracked for the association Wardley Global Select Sterling Bond Fund turned in the quarter\'s best return of eleven \.POINT four \%PERCENT 
4agc0216 Reflecting the strength of the pound British bond funds performed best as a group with a seven \.POINT one \%PERCENT median return 
4agc0217 Funds heavily invested in U\. S\. and Swiss bonds yielded the quarter\'s poorest returns 
4agc0218 But the ride could be bumpy 
4agc0219 South Korean political unrest could curb market gains for one thing 
4agc021a Any severe slump in the U\. S\. market could drag down the Korea Fund too 
4agc021b Currency losses could also eat into returns though economists expect the South Korean won will rise in value against the U\. S\. dollar 
4agc021c And buying a fund for more than its portfolio value can be treacherous some analysts say

4agc0308 Even when complaints are filed they can be difficult to verify 
4agc0309 Agencies generally don\'t use undercover testers posing as prospective tenants as they do in race discrimination complaints they fear that the tester could be attacked

4agc0310 Mr\. Mignanelli meanwhile says he\'s backing Chiat one hundred \%PERCENT and believes that more people now recognize the Nissan name 
4agc0311 Congress also needs to take steps to improve its own ability to protect secrets 
4agc0312 Current procedures almost require an operation\'s cover to be blown before the operation can be discussed outside of committee 
4agc0313 If Congress had adequate security laws and procedures with stiff penalties for violations . the end result probably would be more frank discussion not less 
4agc0314 But the proposal by Texaco\'s largest shareholder which could lead to history\'s largest acquisition involves numerous contingencies

4agc0404 Adds Rob Maguire of Maguire Thomas Partners a Los Angeles based office developer It\'s a terrific location

4agc0407 Did their large potentially unfriendly positions in Harris encourage Harris officials to complete a sale 
4agc0408 Were they working together separately or in concert with Drexel officials to bring about a sale of Harris 
4agc0409 In addition to the war of nerves over discounts retail executives said this Christmas season has been characterized by the absence of a big hit in the toy department 
4agc040a But retailers have seen strong sales of big ticket items to well heeled customers 
4agc040b They are buying to beat the new tax law which will end the deduction of sales tax and some interest expenses 
4agc040c The law even comes with its own Catch twenty two 
4agc040d You\'ll never again be able to fill out your own tax return Roger tells me 
4agc040e But the law also says you probably no longer can deduct the cost of hiring professional help 
4agc040f In addition to several checking accounts and a money market fund he still keeps an old fashioned savings account 
4agc040g The reason 
4agc040h To be fair to the bank Mr\. Merritt says

4agc0415 The report doesn\'t predict any imminent crash 
4agc0416 Indeed its detailed analysis cites several positive factors 
4agc0417 Solid user demand generated by Hong Kong\'s robust economy and rising incomes is one factor

4ahc020b Mr\. Cash of Harvard adds There is a shortsightedness on the part of the suppliers

4ahc0213 One explanation the desire of chief of staff Duberstein earlier viewed as a Dole supporter to ingratiate himself with Bush 
4ahc0214 There are too many cu- cases where customs officers had given their opinion the classification of goods off the top of their heads

4ahc0302 It bought Brooks in September for ninety five million dollars a bit less than book value and took on its debt of sixty seven million dollars 
4ahc0303 The payment consisted mostly of marketable securities apparently bought with the proceeds of the Drexel financing and a promissory note 
4ahc0304 Brooks itself borrowed money to fund the thirty million cash portion 
4ahc0305 But while Eureka projects are more easily approved the vagueness of their funding is one reason many European companies have been skeptical about the program\'s value 
4ahc0306 Another is its loose organization with no central system yet established for checking on the progress of individual projects 
4ahc0307 Most of the projects adopted over the past year haven\'t gotten off the drawing board 
4ahc0308 Bally\'s drive into the hotel casino industry has made health clubs an increasingly awkward fit analysts said and thus the most likely candidate for divestiture 
4ahc0309 By shedding the health club line Bally could focus on its remaining operations gambling machines state lotteries and amusement centers 
4ahc030a Analysts also question the fit of the company\'s theme parks though saying a sale of that operation could follow 
4ahc030b Some were quite vehement in resisting any change

4ahc030v Nevertheless some analysts say that the Fed already may be tightening credit slightly 
4ahc030w They point to recent increases in the federal funds rate which is the rate on reserves that banks lend each other overnight 
4ahc030x The funds rate averaged about seven and five eighths \%PERCENT yesterday and Tuesday up from an average of seven \.POINT four three \%PERCENT in the week ended October seven 
4ahc030y These analysts argue that the increase was engineered by the Fed 
4ahc030z Tax talk by James Baker and Howard Baker riles administration conservatives 
4ahc0310 If the president signs off on significant taxes there\'ll be a lot of screaming and shouting says a White House aide 
4ahc0311 But despite the rhetoric any tax bill accepted by the White House is likely to do little to reduce the red ink 
4ahc0312 Severe new taxes proposed by the House on takeovers also appear doomed 
4ahc0313 But others notably Wells Fargo Investment Advisers pressed on 
4ahc0314 We felt that the futures market reflected actual trading levels at the time says Fred Grauer the head of the Wells Fargo and Company subsidiary 
4ahc0315 Many stock prices hadn\'t been updated in several minutes he explains and it was likely that subsequent stock trades would be at even lower levels 
4ahc0316 By day\'s end Wells sold fourteen thousand futures contracts amounting to nearly two billion dollars 
4ahc0317 The guide looks down and pulls at his socks 
4ahc0318 Later he says when the Russians liberated Smolensk a new commission found German bullets in the skulls of the officers 
4ahc0319 And the method by which they where shot in the backs of the heads was a German method 
4ahc031a And they found German weapons 
4ahc031b That is why the Russians said it was done by the Nazis in nineteen forty one 
4ahc031c And that is everything I know 
4ahc0401 Stan Weinstein the editor of the Professional Tape Reader which also ranked near the bottom of the survey disagrees with several assumptions in Mr\. Hulbert\'s ranking method 
4ahc0402 For example Mr\. Weinstein dislikes the way Mr\. Hulbert calculates entry and exit prices 
4ahc0403 He says Mr\. Hulbert should use prices midway in Mr\. Weinstein\'s recommended *ranges* for stock purchases or sales 
4ahc0404 Mr\. Hulbert customarily uses market prices either the opening price or the average price for the day shortly after the recommendation was made 
4ahc0405 It is a mission that remains relevant in the post segregation era 
4ahc0406 Many current Morehouse students were offered scholarships by predominantly white schools but came here instead

4ahc0408 I\'ve always felt a strong responsibility to the black community he says 
4ahc0409 Moreover a Western firm has to make some calculation of whether Mr\. Gorbachev will succeed in his efforts to activate the Soviet work force 
4ahc040a Past experience and current reports indicate that his chances aren\'t good

4ahc041e When the Federal Reserve earlier this month raised the discount rate it didn\'t increase its popularity 
4ahc041f G\. O\. P\. politicians publicly damned the move with faint praise and privately worried that the Fed was creating a recession that would wipe out George Bush

4aic0304 He also relied heavily on advertising rather than on direct mailing which is by far the most common way for newsletter publishers to solicit subscribers 
4aic0305 This unusual strategy evolved from a small ad placed in a business magazine

4aic0314 But freedom isn\'t an accident 
4aic0315 It is the result of painstaking work to maintain the structure of liberty against inevitable erosion at the hands of the government 
4aic0316 I thought that my work for the A\. C\. L\. U\. was an integral part of maintaining freedom for everyone

4aic0318 In my ministry we have discussed the alternatives of independence

4aic0402 These days it\'s impossible to pick up the papers and read about West German fears of reigniting inflation 
4aic0403 You have to pinch yourself t- to remember that the inflation running near zero in April is now running below zero 
4aic0404 The E\. M\. S\. apparently must be realigned and the franc devalued to accommodate the German taste for deflation 
4aic0405 That hardly matters says Sir Geoffrey noting that with all the traitor spies that preceded him there wasn\'t much left to tell

4aic040h This was the case that upheld Indiana\'s law *regulating* corporate takeovers which went much further than federal laws to protect targets at the expense of the bidders 
4aic040i The result is a crush of anti takeover laws in a dozen states so far 
4aic040j The administration opposes the bill and no similar legislation has been introduced in the Senate 
4aic040k The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee\'s subcommittee on civil service will hold hearings o- on the measure late this year or early in nineteen eighty eight a spokesman said

4aic0416 The seeds of NatWest\'s investment banking problems were sown months before the deregulation of Britain\'s financial markets 
4aic0417 Rivals such as *Barclays* and S\. G\. Warburg Group P\. L\. C\. assembled powerhouse conglomerates of *brokerage* trading and fixed income security firms [door_slam]

4ajc0201 Commercial banks are seeking this kind of business because some of their lines lending to blue chip corporations for example have dried up 
4ajc0202 [tongue_click] Big companies now issue their own paper 
4ajc0203 The old Glass Steagall arguments aimed at limiting risk and dangers that big banks would end up controlling industry look more and more dated 
4ajc0204 Investment banks provide billions in bridge loans for corporate restructurings and takeovers 
4ajc0205 Investment banks seeking more cash will be able to team up with commercial banks without having to look abroad as Goldman Sachs did to find Japan\'s Sumitomo Bank 
4ajc0206 That line may be wearing thin with private banks 
4ajc0207 They would like to see more evidence of sound policy moves 
4ajc0208 Otherwise why keep pouring good money after bad 
4ajc0209 In the February twenty second accord the U\. S\. and its allies asserted that the dollar had declined enough 
4ajc020a They pledged to intervene jointly in the foreign exchange markets to keep exchange rates at about their current levels 
4ajc020b The dollar remained stable for about four weeks after the accord was reached but then began to slump against the Japanese yen 
4ajc020c Central banks intervened and eventually helped arrest the slide

4ajc020z Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value 
4ajc0210 Thus higher bidding narrows the investor\'s return while lower bidding widens it

4ajc0301 Speculation heats up on Volcker\'s future 
4ajc0302 Some believe his odds of being reappointed this summer are enhanced by the weakened position of White House Chief of Staff Regan who wants Volcker out

4ajc031b [tongue_click] The victory celebration of those who opposed the plant may be short lived 
4ajc031c Without this plant Long Island stands a very good chance of major shortages in electrical supplies during its ever increasing peak demand periods 
4ajc031d This lack of reliability will be a signal to business and industry that Long Island is not a desirable place to locate 
4ajc031e Meanwhile local state and national taxpayers will be joining Litco ratepayers in footing the bill for the unused facility

4ajc040y Commission regulations prohibit the sale of pacifiers with strings and require a label warning against this practice

4ajc0413 [tongue_click] Another condition is that Topeka Group a unit of Duluth Minnesota based Minnesota Power and Light Company exercise its option to buy Deltona\'s utility subsidiaries 
4ajc0414 Based on current book value the subsidiaries would fetch thirty two \.POINT five million [<door_slam] in cash plus preferred stock in one of the utility units 
4ajc0415 Topeka said it intends to exercise the option 
4ajc0416 Given the price of the stock it\'s a good use of the cash said William R\. Young an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert *Incorporated* 
4ajc0417 They\'re definitely undervalued

4ajc0419 A shortage of energy and raw materials is already wreaking havoc in many of China\'s major industries 
4ajc041a A factory that makes Nike shoes in Guangdong Province has to run a generator three days a week to stay in operation 
4ajc041b The plant\'s Taiwanese joint venture partners are stockpiling coal and oil for power in case their supplies get cut off 
4ajc041c Many nearby Chinese factories simply shut down two or three days a week for want of energy 
4ajc041d Moreover two thousand workers at the Tianjin aluminum products factory recently were ordered home because the company couldn\'t get enough raw materials

4akc0216 For the nineteen eighty seven third quarter the magazine group had pretax earnings of six \.POINT two million dollars on revenue of fifty nine \.POINT five million 
4akc0217 The expected earnings drop reflects one fewer issue in the quarter of Family Circle 
4akc0218 Also the company cited development costs for three new magazines 
4akc0219 That fight while remarkable for its bitterness typifies the core problem in the nationwide push to contain medical costs Who gets less 
4akc021a Doctors want to maintain their authority and their incomes 
4akc021b Hospitals are fighting to hang onto revenue more than a third of which comes from Medicare 
4akc021c And patients don\'t want to see services decrease 
4akc021d But the health care system now consumes about one million dollars a minute and all agree it needs taming 
4akc021e Analysts say there are all sorts of reasons why the I\. P\. O\.s on one market might outperform those on another over a particular period 
4akc021f For one thing smaller stocks have outperformed larger issues for much of the span covered in N\. A\. S\. D\.\'s statistics 
4akc021g So that probably helped the new issues on the O\. T\. C\. market which are generally smaller than those headed for the Big Board 
4akc0301 In nineteen eighty some government employees C\. I\. A\. had to give up First Amendment rights 
4akc0302 Now it is suggested that officials give up Fifth Amendment rights

4alc0203 He figures that he gets a much better return that way than by putting money in the bank 
4alc0204 He is credited with drilling the presidents of Trust Company\'s eighteen Georgia banks on those fundamentals setting ambitious profit targets and holding the banks strictly accountable for reaching them 
4alc0205 Now Sun\'s twenty six Florida banks get the same treatment from Mr\. Williams 
4alc0206 There\'s a lot of autonomy but you\'ve got to earn it says Thomas S\. Clark the marketing director at Sun\'s Polk County bank 
4alc0207 Just what Shuwa has in mind isn\'t clear 
4alc0208 A spokesman in the United States says the idea is to create a clearinghouse for the sales of United States properties both Shuwa\'s and those owned by others 
4alc0209 Shuwa says it isn\'t aiming to sell to individual investors but to institutions and large investors 
4alc020a Still the sales office is unusual for institutional business moreover it will be on the Ginza an address closely associated with retail shopping

4alc0210 We seem to be ready to take a little rest said one participant 
4alc0211 I don\'t think people are either screamingly worried or screamingly excited about this market said another

4alc0213 New campaign co chairman Laxalt may serve as *intermediary* with the Reagans even after eight years Bush still feels awkward talking to them 
4alc0214 Some strategists think Reagan\'s recent rash of patently partisan moves has been a mistake 
4alc0215 One explanation the desire of the chief of staff *Duberstein* earlier viewed as a Dole supporter to integrate himself with Bush 
4alc0216 Mr\. Taylor will remain president a post he has held since May first

4alc0304 Yesterday Kodak climbed two and three quarters to seventy five and three eighths 
4alc0305 It reported first quarter profit rose to seventy nine cents a share from twenty two cents a share 
4alc0306 But there appear to be some major catches 
4alc0307 Many banks that cut rates have small numbers of cards outstanding 
4alc0308 In other cases lower rates are available only to the most creditworthy customers 
4alc0309 And certain rate reductions are being offset by higher annual fees and elimination of interest free grace periods

4alc030t Most funerals are terribly dignified affairs

4alc040e John Jennings vice president of science and technology of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers\' Association said Doctor Peck may have two scientists below him handling drug review 
4alc040f Two portals instead of one . headed by two fine scientists may mean speedier handling of new drug applications Doctor Jennings said 
4alc040g But if that door is just painted on he added it may not change a lot 
4alc040h The agency said in an order that the staff recommended on August twentieth that the one \.POINT three billion dollar sale be approved

4amc0204 Mr\. Meese announced that the diversion was up to thirty million dollars 
4amc0205 The correct figure turned out to be about three million dollars but this was a comparatively small mistake 
4amc0206 The big problem was that in its haste to rush the story out the White House never thought through its own political legal and constitutional position [door_slam] 
4amc0207 Of course the administration had made mistakes and now had to get the story out 
4amc0208 [door_slam] But it didn\'t need to roll over

4amc030c Where can we find some clues to the answer or at least a possible answer to this question 
4amc030d I would suggest that we look at one Marxist Leninist state that already has gone quite far down the revisionist road 
4amc030e I refer to the curiously neglected instance of Yugoslavia 
4amc030f Those lands have become worth much more than the transportation and energy concern needs for the railroad [loud_breath] and the company had been trying to free itself <from> <the> from the liens

4amc030h A judge a- approved the agreement in November and it became final January twelfth 
4amc030i [sniff] A federal district court and an appeals court both in Richmond upheld the plan

4amc030k Last July the appeals court struck down the plan ruling that affirmative action must be based on evidence that the city itself had discriminated in the past 
4amc030l [tongue_click] Past societal bias isn\'t sufficient basis to justify the plan the appeals court said in an opinion written by Judge J\. Harvie Wilkinson the third

4aoc020s Among its reasons Provigo\'s board cited the fact that *Unigesco* and Empire are already Provigo\'s main shareholders and said the offer won\'t change their effective control 
4aoc020t Provigo also said holders who don\'t accept the offer still will be able to sell their shares on the open market 
4aoc020u [loud_breath] The board concluded that whether or not a holder accepts the offer is a personal investment decision 
4aoc020v The total cut would correspond to the amount of coffee sold and not exceed eighteen thousand bags 
4aoc020w One bag equals sixty kilos

4aoc020y Analysts say there is a strong chance that Kao will take advantage of an earlier U\. S\. acquisition 
4aoc020z Last year it bought High Point North Carolina based High Point Chemical Corporation for an undisclosed sum 
4aoc0210 High Point produces raw materials for toiletries and personal care products 
4aoc0211 So far the administration has ignored these appeals and so have Mr\. Reed and other bankers 
4aoc0212 [loud_breath] It seems that the principles enunciated at the beginning of this decade by Messrs\. 
4aoc0213 Wriston and Theobald still prevail if not in lending the bank\'s money at least in suggesting that other investors put up the cash 
4aoc0214 [loud_breath] And Mr\. Bush pledges to move forward on an issue that has become increasingly important to him in recent years a pact *eliminating* chemical and biological weapons 
4aoc0215 It isn\'t going to be easy because of verification problems Mr\. Bush says 
4aoc0216 But that really is a passion of mine 
4aoc0217 The decision frees Interior officials to formally open oil company bids to lease up to five \.POINT six million acres in a salmon rich area near the Bering Sea

4aoc021b Freddie Mac passes through actual prepayments on a swap mortgage issues while it estimates prepayments on the Cash issues 
4aoc021c Prepayments on Freddie Mac Cash issues are much more volatile from month to month than prepayments on the swap issues 
4aoc021d The investors should have been told said Paul Bernstein an attorney for one of the shareholders 
4aoc021e He said the alleged omissions makes the prospectus misleading 
4aoc021f The suits seek damages of the difference between the offering price and the market price when the suits were filed 
4aoc0301 The latest results indicate the toll that declining hospital use is taking on Humana even though the company has moved to cut costs 
4aoc0302 [loud_breath] A slight increase in the length of stay by hospital patients wasn\'t enough to fully offset a four \.POINT three \%PERCENT decline in admissions 
4aoc0303 Patient days or the total days spent by patients in Humana hospitals fell three \.POINT four \%PERCENT 
4aoc0304 G\. M\.\'s profit plunged seventy \%PERCENT in the fourth quarter partly from the cost of plant closings and other efficiency moves

4aoc030d Any government bailout poses several risks 
4aoc030e One is [door_slam] that the administration may upset the industry\'s competitive balance 
4aoc030f [tongue_click] While big unionized steelmakers are stumbling minimills small plants that make steel from scrap instead of iron ore are flourishing 
4aoc030g By rescuing the big steelmakers some economists say the administration would *implicitly* . say it\'s wrong for market forces to work 
4aoc030h Whatever we think about the current government in Iran it is among the planet\'s most vital territories 
4aoc030i [loud_breath] Our shared enemy has five divisions on Iran\'s northern border

4aoc030k The warm water port the czars dreamed of is within reach 
4aoc030l We will have a lot more than some Kuwaiti tankers to worry about if the Soviets get their paws on the oil spigot to Western Europe and Japan

4aoc030o He takes North Korea for the serious threat that it is 
4aoc030p National security is a big concern for South Koreans and if they think Mr\. Roh can best provide it that\'s a perfectly good reason to vote for him 
4aoc030q Mr\. Roh also favors a freer economy to keep South Korean development rolling 
4aoc030r [loud_breath] Not long after the Northwest announcement the institute wired a press release to media organizations detailing the large number of passenger complaints about Northwest\'s service

4aoc030u March typically benefits from seasonal factors that *boost* U\. S\. exports

4aoc030w Many economists believe that at the very least the underlying trend continues to call for gradual improvement 
4aoc030x But the biggest stumbling block may be the managers themselves 
4aoc030y Many of them can\'t handle criticism from subordinates 
4aoc030z In fact even proponents acknowledge that many managers who receive appraisals just shove the results in a drawer 
4aoc0310 The two laboratories that Nichols purchased are in Lincoln Nebraska and *Sioux* City Iowa

4aoc0314 David *Meister* F\. N\. N\.\'s president acknowledged the company has been in discussion with other media concerns but he declined to identify them 
4aoc0315 [other_mouth_sound] We\'ve spoken to virtually every company you can imagine plus a half dozen more you wouldn\'t think of Mr\. *Meister* said 
4aoc0316 He denied industry speculation that F\. N\. N\. is looking to sell the company 
4aoc0317 We\'re not interested in selling and we\'re not soliciting anything he said 
4aoc0318 However he added that\'s not to say we wouldn\'t entertain any reasonable offer for at least a piece of F\. N\. N\. 
4aoc0319 None of this means Japanese industrial management will be transformed overnight 
4aoc031a [tongue_click] Change will come slowly because Japanese society still has a l- strong tendency to hammer down any nail that sticks up 
4aoc031b There may be a growing Japanese self confidence in Japan but there are relatively f:ew Japanese entrepreneurs 
4aoc031c There may be sca:ds of money in Japan but there is precious little venture capital

4aoc0410 But though reform is essential if the debtor . countries are to have an economic future 
4aoc0411 A large part of the *Third* *World* debt in Venezuela it was ninety \%PERCENT went to finance capital flight 
4aoc0412 Until the countries can persuade their own citizens to invest at home new capital from abroad isn\'t likely to rush in or ultimately to be very useful 
4aoc0413 Peter DaPuzzo head of retail trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton also looks for a sharp upward move in stock prices given a few ifs 
4aoc0414 One is if investors don\'t get spooked at the anniversary of the crash 
4aoc0415 Another is if the Federal Reserve eases interest rates 
4aoc0416 And a third is if George Bush wins the presidential election 
4aoc0417 The injunction had been sought by Johnson and Swanson a Dallas law firm that represents twelve companies in the federal court proceeding where several cases are consolidated 
4aoc0418 Carl Taylor an attorney in the firm\'s Washington office estimated that twenty five to thirty companies are protected by the injunction 
4aoc0419 The court order doesn\'t affect hundreds of other companies that are challenging the tax in state court but aren\'t involved in the federal case 
4aoc041a Getting the deal right is the key 
4aoc041b Unlike warrants on the Japanese stock . deals for U\. S\. companies aren\'t really covered by the ownership of underlying shares 
4aoc041c Instead underwriters use what they call a dynamic hedge

4apc0313 Some money managers are pursuing undervalued stocks such as technology issues while others may be standing aside or selling 
4apc0314 The result has been heavy volume a large amount of block trading and narrow spreads between buying and selling prices

4apc0415 A simpler way to reduce bank debts that is more advantageous to borrowers are straight buy backs in the growing secondary loan market 
4apc0416 Buy backs helped clear up the Latin American debt problems in the nineteen thirties 
4apc0417 In March Bolivia bought back just under half its six hundred seventy million dollars . bank debt at eleven cents for each dollar of debt 
4apc0418 That caused problems that reached down to individual franchises

4aqc0205 But when L\. B\. O\. companies sell stock the big winners usually are a tight circle of executives and investment bankers who earlier bought control 
4aqc0206 Profits often exceed ten times these investors\' original stake

4aqc021e One of Mr\. Hook\'s most remarkable parables still stays fresh in my mind 
4aqc021f He told of an old man dying in the springtime who called his sons to his bedside 
4aqc021g My treasure he said is buried somewhere on this farm 
4aqc021h You have only to dig to find it

4aqc0302 Our dependence upon violence to resolve conflict is a short run solution to a long term problem

4aqc030e Congress now turns to its rewrite of the Gramm Rudman law which had targeted the fiscal nineteen eighty eight deficit at a hundred and eight billion dollars

4aqc030g Petroleum Helicopters Incorporated said it plans to offer two \.POINT six million to three million shares of its nonvoting common stock before year end 
4aqc030h The provider of helicopter services for companies engaged in offshore oil and natural gas exploration said proceeds will be used to reduce long term debt

4arc040g Mr\. Bowman said he sent a letter to Dayton Hudson officials questioning their rejection of the Dart Group bid 
4arc040h I\'d characterize us as upset he said 
4arc040i I wouldn\'t be doing my fiduciary responsibility if I didn\'t ask them what was going on 
4arc040j Implied in the piece was that I should have asked about Senator Kennedy\'s behavior in the hearings 
4arc040k I did poll on the fairness of the Judiciary Committee to Judge Bork and a fifty six \%PERCENT to twenty \%PERCENT majority thought the committee had been fair 
4arc040l I would also point out that after the Chappaquiddick episode our poll for Time magazine was widely viewed as the most blunt and unsparing of Senator Kennedy

4arc040r They\'re very independent and very jaded 
4arc040s Academy members have seen thousands of pictures he adds and you can\'t hustle them 
4arc040t Then there are differences in how corporate directors are required to act 
4arc040u In Britain directors\' legal duty is to shareholders Dutch law obligates directors to protect the company\'s interest including employees customers and creditors 
4arc040v Dutch law is so hostile to unfriendly bids that none has succeeded there since nineteen sixty 
4arc040w The cost of installing sprinkler systems is high 
4arc040x One Los Angeles fire official estimated that full systems cost from one dollar to three dollars per square foot

4arc0413 But Mr\. Parcher is also considered abrasive at times 
4arc0414 He rubs some people wrong says Leonard Marks who has tried cases against him 
4arc0415 He\'s very outspoken 
4arc0416 The indictments allege that Messrs\. 
4arc0417 Martino and Orloff approved more than five hundred thousand dollars for work done largely by Hanley Worldwide 
4arc0418 They received payments in cash and in the form of clothes club memberships and payment of personal bills according to the charges 
4arc0419 Under previous administrations corporate bailouts and restructurings were common 
4arc041a But some led to charges of corruption that are now being investigated in the opposition controlled National Assembly 
4arc041b President Roh Tae Woo\'s government doesn\'t want to provoke similar suspicions nor does it want to appear to be shoring up another failing company at taxpayers\' expense 
4arc041c Mr\. Reischauer an economist also sought to make a moral issue of the deficit 
4arc041d It\'s unseemly to have the richest nation of the world drawing the resources of the rest of the world to support consumption he said 
4arc041e Instead of lending money to the U\. S\. he said that Western Europe and Japan should be investing it in underdeveloped countries 
4asc0201 Mr\. Webster went out of his way to dismiss allegations that Lieutenant Colonel North or others may have destroyed important documents before investigators secured them 
4asc0202 We have found no indications to date that any evidence was lost Mr\. Webster said 
4asc0203 There\'s nothing that we have found that indicates we lost anything 
4asc0204 We do take exception however to your editorial\'s comments on the situation 
4asc0205 The committee\'s recommendation is not cause for an ad hominem attack on Doctor Robert Temple one of the F\. D\. A\.\'s leading physician scientists 
4asc0206 Doctor Temple is not responsible for the opinion of an outside advisory committee nor will the decision on T\. P\. A\. be made by the office he heads 
4asc0207 He also relied heavily on advertising rather than on direct mailing which is by far the most common way for newsletter publishers to solicit subscribers 
4asc0208 This unusual strategy evolved from a small ad placed in a business magazine 
4asc0209 The nine hundred fifty dollar ad generated enough subscriptions to pay for itself in a week so Mr\. Kobren began advertising in other publications

4asc020r Jordan and Djibouti did but have since restored relations 
4asc020s For two years after his nineteen eighty one election he put into effect the Socialist program of fast reflation and wholesale nationalization 
4asc020t As inflation soared and the franc nose dived his approval rating plunged 
4asc020u Then he changed course completely 
4asc020v His nineteen eighty three austerity program was applauded by even his right wing opponents 
4asc020w After naming four Communists to his original cabinet he broke with the Communists in nineteen eighty four and destroyed them as a political force 
4asc020x We never had one before Mr\. Timbers said 
4asc020y A certain percentage of our clients would like to have that option 
4asc020z It\'s not necessarily a market call 
4asc0210 Mr\. Timbers says he\'s fairly ambivalent about the price of gold near term 
4asc0211 He does see however higher inflation of five \%PERCENT or so in nineteen eighty nine up from four \%PERCENT this year 
4asc0212 A gold option could be a nice alternative for fixed income investors should inflation fears arise Mr\. Timbers says 
4asc0213 Rates on short term Treasury bills also were little changed 
4asc0214 The rate on the latest three month bill fell to five \.POINT seven one \%PERCENT bid from five \.POINT seven two \%PERCENT Wednesday 
4asc0215 But the rate on the latest six month bill climbed to six \.POINT oh four \%PERCENT bid from six \.POINT oh three \%PERCENT 
4asc0216 The bill which is expected to be enacted in the next few days also would prevent states from setting other credit card disclosure requirements 
4asc0217 Bankers had sought that to avoid having to meet a plethora of differing disclosure standards 
4asc0218 We\'re very happy with the pre emption said Barbara Munson manager of congressional relations for the Consumer Bankers Association a trade group 
4asc0219 They like many dealers blame V\. W\.\'s decline on Mr\. Phillips and his low profile style of management 
4asc021a But Jack Price an Albuquerque New Mexico V\. W\. dealer said Mr\. Phillips\'s calm approach helped lead the company through its difficult times 
4asc021b His defenders also noted that many European auto makers have struggled in the U\. S\. recently because of the declining value of the dollar 
4asc021c Mr\. Phillips was unavailable to comment on his job change yesterday company officials said 
4asc021d In Philips Sun has won a European ally that it hopes will provide an edge over competitors 
4asc021e Motorola Incorporated M\. I\. P\. S\. Computer Systems Incorporated and Hewlett Packard Company are jockeying to woo computer makers to their own R\. I\. S\. C\. chips 
4asc021f The chips are rapidly gaining popularity among computer makers and the one that gets the most converts could become a de facto standard in tomorrow\'s computer industry 
4asc0301 The court has ordered Mr\. Ward and Guinness\'s former chairman Ernest Saunders to return the money 
4asc0302 It also has frozen as much as eight \.POINT four million dollars of their assets 
4asc0303 But the two men\'s lawyers are asking that the order granted temporarily be lifted pending the outcome of a full trial 
4asc0304 The court was split on both the Williams Act and commerce clause 
4asc0305 Justice Lewis Powell acknowledged that the nineteen eighty two case of Edgar versus 
4asc0306 M\. I\. T\. E\. suggested that any state law that favored targets more than did the Williams Act would be invalid because Congress had preempted local regulations 
4asc0307 The court backtracked here to say state laws might be O\. K\. if they help the Williams Act\'s purpose by heaping even more burdens on acquirers 
4asc0308 He took the tag number of their car Mr\. Clifton recalled referring to Mr\. McGee 
4asc0309 And he came and got me and said Hey this is the real thing

4asc030d Belvedere 
4asc030e One of the network\'s prime time news programs Our World also was canceled 
4asc030f But at least one defense industry analyst called the price somewhat stingy 
4asc030g It\'s fair but on the low end of what I would consider the reasonable range said Robert M\. Hanisee of Seidler Amdec Securities of Los Angeles 
4asc030h When I heard the price I was shocked 
4asc030i I thought it would sell in the low thirties

4asc030n There\'s no mindless attempt to say we\'re going to tax private corporations out of existence he says 
4asc030o That\'s silly you don\'t do that 
4asc030p You want them to do well 
4asc030q At first some medical professionals had reservations about such corporate initiative 
4asc030r A hospital official recalls this attitude You make beer cans 
4asc030s Don\'t tell us how to practice medicine 
4asc030t Last month however the hospital started to discount room rates for Alcoa employees 
4asc030u It also agreed to use MedisGroups and then disclose certain clinically related data to the company 
4asc030v And many doctors at the hospital have agreed to cap their fees 
4asc030w We\'ve always wondered how to square Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega\'s rough words with his soft treatment in the Democratic controlled U\. S\. Congress 
4asc030x Maybe he has too because he\'s upped the ante 
4asc030y He has now branded not only the Republicans but also the Democrats as imperialists because both parties have talked recently about helping the Contras 
4asc030z What do the Democrats become if they actually vote the bandages 
4asc0310 Helped by Wednesday\'s Wall Street rally and improved commodity prices stock prices posted robust gains in Sydney 
4asc0311 Turnover remained thin

4asc0317 Where do you go around here to have a good cry said the likable seeming thirty five year old in the press tent afterward 
4asc0318 Choking back sobs he remarked It\'s only a game right 
4asc0319 When asked he said that even the outlet of going home and kicking his dog wasn\'t available

4asc031b In some cases consumers can choose among as many as fifteen generic versions of a brand name prescription drug 
4asc031c We aren\'t picking on any particular manufacturer said Irene Caro acting F\. D\. A\. district director in Los Angeles 
4asc031d We are just selecting a range of manufacturers who are making these generic products 
4asc0401 The F\. D\. P\. is the one party that has at least been grappling seriously with the concept of supply side tax cuts 
4asc0402 The F\. D\. P\.\'s Otto Lambsdorff a former economics minister has helped move the F\. D\. P\. ahead of the Kohl Stoltenberg combine on this issue 
4asc0403 In an interview last month Mr\. Lambsdorff called for considerable tax cuts which hopefully can begin in nineteen eighty seven 
4asc0404 Ideally Mr\. Lambsdorff would be given an opportunity to argue his views inside the government 
4asc0405 The most recent trigger price for suspending quotas one \.POINT five zero zero eight dollars a pound was exceeded December twelve nineteen eighty five 
4asc0406 Quotas were suspended in February nineteen eighty six

4asc0408 The Treasury rules however contain modifications of the S\. E\. C\. rules designed to improve protection of parties involved in repurchase agreements 
4asc0409 In such agreements called repos one party sells government securities to another with the understanding that the seller *will* repurchase them later at a specified price 
4asc040a The proposed modifications would apply to government securities brokers or dealers that are already registered as well as to newly registered entities 
4asc040b Mr\. Botha !also must rule on the fate of the Group Areas Act 
4asc040c Violations of the act are rampant but there were only four prosecutions under it in nineteen eighty six one in nineteen eighty five and none the year before 
4asc040d A recent poll by the Afrikaans newspaper Rapport found that only twenty seven \%PERCENT of surveyed whites want the act retained 
4asc040e More than twenty four \%PERCENT want it scrapped completely while another thirty four \%PERCENT want each local community or property owner to decide who can rent or buy housing [sniff]

4asc040g Many of the some sixty thousand cars and trucks were driven for up to four hundred miles 
4asc040h Lee Iacocca has now called this practice dumb and stupid 
4asc040i That decision is likely to intensify the political heat on Norway\'s minority Labor Party government 
4asc040j Last week it published a critical report on the work at Mongstad but stopped short of calling for resignations 
4asc040k The government has said the cost of replacing senior executives would outweigh the possible significance of the action 
4asc040l Foul weather was also blamed by a spokesman for Pan Am the first place finisher in December 
4asc040m Weather particularly affected flights in the Northeast and Europe where most of Pan Am\'s routes are located he said 
4asc040n He added that Pan Am nonetheless turned in one of the best performances among major carriers 
4asc040o He predicted the next report will show a rebound for the airline in February 
4asc040p The next Olympic stop in September is Seoul and there is reason to doubt it will go as quietly as the Calgary Games 
4asc040q South Korea is in political turmoil its officials have said they expect trouble from their sparring partners to the north and the U\. S\. fleet will patrol offshore 
4asc040r Under such circumstances I can\'t help thinking that any and all security measures will be welcome

4asc040x Attendants in search of other P\. S\. two clones here have to scour carefully 
4asc040y Acer International Corporation of Taiwan shows a machine billed as compatible with the bottom of the line P\. S\. two Model thirty 
4asc040z This avoids all the legal issues an Acer official promises 
4asc0410 But it also avoids most of the new technology in the P\. S\. two family 
4asc0411 A tougher anti Noriega policy need not launch a new round of U\. S\. meddling abroad or even a global anti drug crusade 
4asc0412 Many governments involved in crimes against Americans will always remain outside America\'s reach 
4asc0413 But the U\. S\. has the right and the power to stop General Noriega\'s aggression against its youth and inner cities 
4asc0414 Continuing the current policy of waffling is a confession that for all America\'s squawking official drug trafficking is something we can live with 
4asc0415 The group here in Liberty Center was recruited by a farmer who promised work for three months 
4asc0416 With the promise now meaningless the band has taken refuge at the Migrant Rest Center beyond the usual three day limit 
4asc0417 For that kindness they thank Maria Rodriquez the sixty seven year old former migrant who runs the shelter 
4asc0418 They call her a saint Santa Maria 
4asc0419 Mr\. Bush was dismissive of the National Economic Commission a bipartisan panel that is studying ways to attack the deficit 
4asc041a Many business and political leaders see the commission as providing the political cover necessary for a new president to deal effectively with the deficit problem 
4asc041b But many conservatives worry that commission members will recommend a tax boost as part of a deficit cutting package 
4asc041c In sum both the improvements in income to persons and their distribution bear out neither the thesis of stagnation nor decline in income 
4asc041d Nor any increased polarization in the distribution of income 
4asc041e Quite the opposite 
4atc0201 Although some cabinet members had been expected to step down the mass action took many by surprise 
4atc0202 [loud_breath] Mr\. Benigno said talk of resigning started during a cabinet meeting

4atc0204 I\. R\. E\. has downsized its real estate syndication business and is primarily a savings and loan holding company Mr\. Levan said 
4atc0205 Earnings in the past were somewhat erratic quarter to quarter because the major business was real estate syndication 
4atc0206 Now the S\. and L\. holding company is the main business with down sized real estate syndication 
4atc0207 Core earnings are very consistent 
4atc0208 Nevertheless some analysts say the Fed already may be tightening credit slightly 
4atc0209 They point to recent increases in the federal funds rate which is the rate on reserves that banks lend each other overnight 
4atc020a The funds rate averaged about seven and five eighths \%PERCENT yesterday and Tuesday up from an average of seven \.POINT four three \%PERCENT in the week ended October seven 
4atc020b These analysts argue that the increase was engineered by the Fed 
4atc020c Along with his partner Phil DiLeo Mr\. Kellner has been regarded as one of Wall Street\'s biggest and brightest moneymakers 
4atc020d Kellner DiLeo started in nineteen eighty one with only five million dollars and reportedly has had average annual gains of sixty \%PERCENT before payouts to limited partners 
4atc020e Last year the firm is said to have earned more than sixty million dollars 
4atc020f Analysts said the agreement has been rumored for some time 
4atc020g However they said it was somewhat surprising given that Savannah Electric recently said it was considering forming a holding [<beep] company in order to diversify 
4atc020h A Savannah Electric spokesman said the acquisition by Southern will allow the company to achieve the some of the same results in a more efficient manner 
4atc020i Dealers said activity was slow because of the U\. S\. holiday celebrating the birthday of Martin Luther King Junior 
4atc020j Most U\. S\. banks were closed although several of the larger foreign exchange departments remained open to service corporate and institutional customers and trade with Europe

4atc0211 Just before the October nineteen global equities crash Hongkong Bank economists expressed similar concern about the speculation that then dominated the local stock market 
4atc0212 Their property report recalls the equities crash as a reminder that asset values cannot defy gravity for ever 
4atc0213 This warning now represents a minority view 
4atc0214 Blame it on a local nineteen fifty seven ordinance that bars worldly employment or business except works of necessity and charity on Sunday 
4atc0215 Recreation related businesses such as movie theaters and bowling alleys are also exempt 
4atc0216 The purpose of the ban is to keep down traffic the town says 
4atc0217 We know that these theoretical economic concepts do not always work out perfectly in the real world 
4atc0218 On the other hand we know that they are essential if we are to understand and explain prices interest rates and investment decisions

4atc0302 The new airport will be constructed on a man made island in Osaka harbor 
4atc0303 Access will be by a single double decker bridge for cars and trains making the airport vulnerable to civic unrest of the kind that has plagued Narita 
4atc0304 Falling interest rates good news for other securities markets brought heavy losses to the mortgage backed securities market in the first part of the year 
4atc0305 A lot of high yielding mortgage pools and the securities they backed simply evaporated as homeowners refinanced their high interest mortgages [misc_noise] 
4atc0306 [tongue_click] The spread between U\. S\. Treasury bond rates and mortgage backed security rates widened by almost two percentage points creating severe problems for traders and investors 
4atc0307 The transaction is so risky that Pratt and Whitney a unit of United Technologies Corp\. in effect dropped out of the competition to supply engines for the planes 
4atc0308 As a result General Electric Company is expected to win the order for all the engines 
4atc0309 The engine orders usually account for about twenty \%PERCENT of the total or in this case nearly five hundred million dollars [misc_noise]

4atc030n The dollar\'s decline hadn\'t helped either as retailers who depend on goods from the Far East had to absorb higher costs 
4atc030o Another reason Mr\. Soifer is avoiding Morgan and Citicorp is that their stock prices at times have tended to gyrate more violently than other bank issues

4atc031a Schering Plough said Grupo Ache has an option to buy the rest 
4atc031b The Brazilian operations based in Rio de Janeiro include a pharmaceutical manufacturing plant and offices that employ about nine hundred people 
4atc031c Schering Plough said Grupo Ache would install its own management 
4atc031d The Brazilian facility had nineteen eighty eight sales of seventy million dollars 
4atc0401 A spokeswoman for C\. B\. S\. said there are serious issues and we\'re trying our best to find solutions while operating in a very demanding economic climate 
4atc0402 We\'re continuing to bargain 
4atc0403 Capital Cities A\. B\. C\. declined to comment on the talks 
4atc0404 Next year when Democrats regain control of the Senate prospects will be markedly better that Congress actually will enact trade legislation 
4atc0405 Already congressional Democrats have made trade their top priority 
4atc0406 But Democratic Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas who will be chairman of the Senate Finance Committee next year has been calling for a bipartisan approach 
4atc0407 That decision came easily 
4atc0408 Now he\'s working amid the metal folding chairs in his transition office in the austere chamber of the Senate Education Committee 
4atc0409 His first budget must go to the printer two days after he\'s inaugurated 
4atc040a Many Americans remember when Congress thought poverty was caused by a lack of money so it provided money 
4atc040b It thought unemployment was caused by a shortage of jobs so it created work 
4atc040c Congress thought hunger was solely attributable to lack of food so it made food freely available 
4atc040d But each problem proved to be far more complicated than originally thought 
4atc040e Three decades and more than a trillion dollars later we are seemingly no further along on these social problems than when we started 
4atc040f Or at least that is what we are repeatedly told as Congress requests more money for all its past creations 
4atc040g Senator William Proxmire Democrat of Wisconsin sharply criticized the Fed for dropping the M\. one target 
4atc040h He also contended that it is an extremely dangerous and unwise policy to allow M\. one to expand as rapidly as it has 
4atc040i Last year M\. one which consists of checking deposits plus cash held by the public soared fifteen \.POINT two \%PERCENT 
4atc040j That was far above the Fed\'s target of three to eight \%PERCENT 
4atc040k A Digital spokesman said the court action doesn\'t change the status quo 
4atc040l The part of the ruling that was overturned hasn\'t been in effect since last January when Emulex obtained the stay he said

4atc040t For over half a century federal policy has sapped the productivity of the world\'s strongest agriculture industry 
4atc040u The real issue is not the dollar amount of U\. S\. food [<door_slam] exports but whether those exports are sold at a profit or a loss 
4atc040v The sooner politicians stop trying to help farmers the better off the most efficient productive farmers will be 
4atc040w State workers are another constituency

4atc040z Champion said about two thousand one hundred workers struck its five lumber and plywood plants in the region over the weekend 
4atc0410 *Stamford* Connecticut based Champion has fourteen such plants nationwide the spokesman said 
4atc0411 The International Woodworkers of America and the Western Council of Industrial Workers union struck two Champion mills where the contract recently expired according to a Champion spokesman 
4atc0412 Picket lines erected by those strikers quickly closed the others where contracts either have expired or will expire by July thirty one he added

4atc0415 In Texas it was up three \%PERCENT in nineteen eighty six and eight \.POINT four \%PERCENT in nineteen eighty seven 
4atc0416 Despite yesterday\'s run up traders remained skeptical about the U\. S\. currency\'s potential to climb much further 
4atc0417 The next couple of days it will come off again predicted Reinhard Pfeiffer chief dealer for D\. G\. Bank in Frankfurt 
4atc0418 I don\'t see the dollar at one ninety again 
4atc0419 [tongue_click] If the currency continued to rise he said he expected the Bundesbank to intervene as early as today in Far Eastern markets 
4atc041a Pennzoil jumped three and a half to eighty five and a quarter

4auc0201 [loud_breath] Mr\. Epstein said he set some very short range goals to help Penril get back into the black [loud_breath] 
4auc0202 His plans include restructuring some debt and selling one of the company\'s five divisions to generate enough capital to finance the growth of the other four 
4auc0203 He declined to identify the division that will be sold 
4auc0204 We\'re going to use his statements says Mr\. Viguerie 
4auc0205 [loud_breath] He is really committed to the radical leftist agenda and he\'ll become a real lightning rod 
4auc0206 [tongue_click] Conservatives will respond 
4auc0207 He\'ll become a household word and causes he espouses will automatically get opposition from conservatives and Republicans 
4auc0208 Don\'t make that same mistake 
4auc0209 Read The Corporate Warriors for its own sake an interesting and entertaining account of corporate battles that have some surface similarities to military campaigns 
4auc020a But don\'t confuse the boardroom with the battlefield

4auc020c The Japanese stock market is awash with liquidity Mr\. Grant says 
4auc020d [loud_breath] But in June suddenly with no apparent drainage it went down and kept going down he says 
4auc020e [loud_breath] What is a mystery to Mr\. Grant and many others is that the Tokyo market has since staged a vigorous rebound 
4auc020f [loud_breath] Warranty *dealing* is tricky even for experienced traders adds Harry Sibley Morgan Stanley and Company\'s equity warrant specialist 
4auc020g [loud_breath] It is common for one third of all issues traded to fluctuate at least fifty \%PERCENT in price every day he says 
4auc020h That sort of volatility Mr\. Sibley believes plus a severe shortage of experienced traders in London may restrict the number of additional players in Japanese equity warrants 
4auc020i Tomorrow morning\'s trade report is likely to show a deficit of fifteen billion to sixteen billion according to many analysts 
4auc020j [tongue_click] In June the deficit was fifteen \.POINT seven billion 
4auc020k [tongue_click] However rumors swept through the markets early yesterday that the gap will be as much as nineteen billion 
4auc020l Many analysts contend that the deficit will remain large [loud_breath] depressing the dollar further and heightening investor fear of inflation 
4auc020m Mr\. Icahn couldn\'t be reached for comment and it was unclear what intentions he might ultimately harbor toward Tenneco 
4auc020n His position in the company is understood to be one of more than twenty similar stakes he has amassed in a variety of concerns

4auc020s Moreover some housing specialists say permit activity is a poor indicator of future starts arguing that it reflects current housing activity rather than predicting future activity 
4auc020t They predict that instead of falling housing starts will improve in coming months in reaction to increasing new and existing home sales 
4auc020u [loud_breath] One notable exception to this trend will be the Southwest which has been battered by recession and a housing glut 
4auc020v In July nineteen eighty six Colorado raised its diesel fuel tax fifty seven \%PERCENT to twenty \.POINT five cents a gallon the highest in the U\. S\. 
4auc020w The move was a success as a money raiser 
4auc020x [tongue_click] Diesel fuel tax collections soared ten million in the twelve months after the increase to thirty six \.POINT five million 
4auc020y No he\'s not

4auc0213 In per student payments Cornell ranked seventh at seventy dollars 
4auc0214 The closest to an industrial issue is Kloster Cruise Limited\'s planned offering of one hundred fifty million of non callable five year notes 
4auc0215 [tongue_click] The issue will be one hundred \%PERCENT backed by a letter of credit issued by the Industrial Bank of Japan\'s New York branch 
4auc0216 Therefore it is rated triple A by Moody\'s Investors Service Incorporated and Standard and Poor\'s Corporation 
4auc0217 It is expected to be priced at a spread of zero \.POINT eighty five percentage point above the Treasury five year note 
4auc0218 Moreover fiercely competitive organizations often shy away from courtroom confrontations over business tactics because of questions of image 
4auc0219 [tongue_click] The macho mentality of many corporate board rooms disdains defamation suits because they make a company look whiny says Mr\. Hanson 
4auc021a [tongue_click] Most companies he says are afraid to look as if they can\'t take the competition 
4auc021b Airlines say airspace has become so crowded in Europe that any airline missing an assigned takeoff slot may have to wait an hour for another free slot 
4auc021c Each country in Europe also operates its own air traffic control system and this makes the entire European air system vulnerable to the continent\'s frequent air controller strikes 
4auc021d [tongue_click] Two weeks ago for instance a weekend strike by engineers who control airplanes in flight over France caused horrendous backups on British flights heading through French airspace 
4auc021e Insurance coverage for small medical bills is especially wasteful 
4auc021f Usually it will cost an insurer more than fifty dollars to monitor effectively a fifty dollar physician bill thereby doubling the cost of health insurance 
4auc021g [tongue_click] But failure to monitor encourages patients and doctors to make wasteful decisions without fear of third party scrutiny 
4auc0301 [loud_breath] Contrasts abound on both sides of the causeway 
4auc0302 [loud_breath] Bahraini women can board the bus for the twenty minute ride to Saudi Arabia 
4auc0303 [loud_breath] On the other side Saudi women cannot board unaccompanied by husband brother father or son 
4auc0304 [loud_breath] In Bahrain the women can drive [loud_breath] but not over the causeway to Saudi Arabia where women aren\'t allowed behind the wheel 
4auc0305 [loud_breath] The Hunts and the banks would have plenty of reasons to try to settle their lawsuits 
4auc0306 [tongue_click] So far the Hunts have lost almost every major round in court 
4auc0307 [loud_breath] To block a bank foreclosure the brothers were forced to put Placid and Herbert Hunt\'s trust [loud_breath] under the protection of federal Bankruptcy Court last August 
4auc0308 I\'m positive on the move to his new post Mr\. Rhines said 
4auc0309 I grew up in the semiconductor group

4auc030b B\. O\. C\. designed the plant for enhanced recovery of argon [loud_breath] used in producing steel and other metals and in the electronics industry 
4auc030c When completed in nineteen eighty nine the plant will increase the argon capacity [loud_breath] of the Pacific Northwest by thirty \%PERCENT the company said

4auc030e Circle said Gary L\. Eyler will remain chief executive officer of Overland and Continental and will become chief operating officer of Circle 
4auc030f [tongue_click] Mr\. Eyler owns a controlling interest in Continental 
4auc030g Circle said it expects no major management changes at any of the companies 
4auc030h If its maverick strategy works Security Pacific will be showing another way besides acquisitions for superregional banks to grow 
4auc030i [loud_breath] These banks\' managers including Mr\. Flamson plan to eventually challenge the big New York banks *as* national giants in their own right 
4auc030j [loud_breath] Bolstered by strong equity capital positions superregionals already are growing faster than money center institutions

4auc030o Mr\. Cox wasn\'t named 
4auc030p The head of a rival Eurobond house said Mr\. Cox felt unwanted after all those years in London 
4auc030q Mr\. Cox began considering leaving the firm as long as a year ago 
4auc030r [tongue_click] But his appointment last fall to the firm\'s management committee [loud_breath] deferred any move until the board appointments 
4auc030s [tongue_click] So what is the official interpretation 
4auc030t There really is no script for our Benson and Hedges ads says Kenneth *Olshan* chairman of Wells Rich 
4auc030u We just told the actors to do what they would naturally do at a brunch 
4auc030v We\'re trying to avoid cliches 
4auc030w [tongue_click] In fact Mead based in Dayton Ohio said the sale is part of its strategy to focus on more value added products 
4auc030x For instance it acquired a paper distributorship and an office supply business in nineteen eighty six 
4auc030y Last year it announced a five hundred million dollar expansion [loud_breath] of its coated paperboard operations 
4auc030z [tongue_click] Such businesses are less severely cyclical than commodities based ones 
4auc0310 The following officers directors and large stockholders of companies reported changes in holdings under the Securities Exchange Act of nineteen thirty four 
4auc0311 Those identified as beneficial owners hold at least ten \%PERCENT of a company\'s equity securities 
4auc0312 [tongue_click] Unless otherwise noted changes involved direct holdings of common stock and took place in May nineteen eighty eight 
4auc0313 [tongue_click] Companies are listed where transactions generally aggregate ten thousand shares or one hundred thousand dollars 
4auc0314 Almost unnoticed in discussions of the procurement scandal is the fact that this elaborate indeed tortuous system seems to have worked at least on its own terms 
4auc0315 [tongue_click] Nobody was able to throw a contract directly 
4auc0316 [tongue_click] Instead what some contractors seem to have done is to buy inside information that would allow them to prepare a better proposal 
4auc0317 [loud_breath] Disdain for the C\. word is nothing new in the chemical industry 
4auc0318 [loud_breath] Saint Louis based Monsanto Company dropped chemical from its name in nineteen sixty four when the company diversified into other businesses 
4auc0319 [tongue_click] But Monsanto also wanted to distance itself from public outcry against chemical companies in general 
4auc031a There\'s a school of thought that if you\'ve got that word in your name you\'re a target for trouble a Monsanto official says 
4auc031b [tongue_click] Peter DaPuzzo head of retail trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton also looks for a sharp upward move in stock prices given a few ifs 
4auc031c [tongue_click] One is if investors don\'t get spooked at the anniversary of the crash 
4auc031d [tongue_click] Another is if the Federal Reserve eases interest rates 
4auc031e And a third is if George Bush wins the presidential election 
4auc0401 In addition to the war of nerves over discounts retail executives said this Christmas season has been characterized by the absence of a big hit in the toy department 
4auc0402 [loud_breath] But retailers have seen strong sales of big ticket items to well heeled customers 
4auc0403 They are trying to beat the new tax law which will end the deduction of sales taxes and some interest expenses 
4auc0404 [tongue_click] Falling interest rates good news for other *securities* markets brought heavy losses to the mortgage backed securities market in the first part of the year 
4auc0405 A lot of high yielding mortgage pools and the securities they backed simply evaporated as homeowners refinanced their high interest mortgages 
4auc0406 The spread between U\. S\. Treasury bond rates and the mortgage backed security rates widened by almost two percentage points creating severe problems for traders and investors 
4auc0407 Mr\. Jacobs has announced plans to leave on February first to form a new firm with another partner John F\. Gerard 
4auc0408 [tongue_click] Several staff members plan to leave with him 
4auc0409 Mr\. Jacobs said his departure has nothing to do with the firm\'s problems 
4auc040a I\'m not a big firm kind of guy he said 
4auc040b I don\'t want to live by consensus 
4auc040c I want some beef for a special recipe says the housewife *from* San Francisco

4auc040f That\'s thirty dollars 
4auc040g Two desirable results arise from placing corporate governance decisions as close to the shareholders as possible 
4auc040h First the decision makers closest to the issue are likely to have the best information with which to make decisions 
4auc040i Second the opportunity arises for experimentation with different rules of corporate governance 
4auc040j [tongue_click] Mr\. Beeney then subpoenaed the liquidator demanding the files 
4auc040k [tongue_click] In a letter to Mr\. Wiener he said he was serving the subpoena on *behalf* of Doctor Wynyard whom he identified as the executor of his father\'s estate

4auc040n John Gray a Hongkong Bank executive director confirmed that the bank is shopping for a European acquisition [loud_breath] but maintains that no specific target is in sight yet 
4auc040o [loud_breath] Europe is where the gap is in our global operations he said 
4auc040p Separately Wall Street speculation grew that the media investor Rupert Murdoch was considering acquiring a stake in London based W\. P\. P\. 
4auc040q A Murdoch aide said that Mr\. Murdoch [loud_breath] has been looking for a long time at the company

4auc040s Mr\. Reagan vigorously defended Attorney General Edwin Meese who is under investigation for his role in advancing a Middle East oil pipeline advocated by one of Mr\. Meese\'s friends 
4auc040t [tongue_click] Mr\. Reagan said he couldn\'t remember being told anything about the pipeline and expressed every confidence in Mr\. Meese\'s integrity 
4auc040u [tongue_click] He also criticized the lynch mob atmosphere that has accompanied investigations of his aides 
4auc040v An Eastern spokesman said the filings are without merit 
4auc040w [tongue_click] The fact is that Eastern and Continental are two distinct companies with operations that are quite separate he said 
4auc040x [tongue_click] There really should be no questions about that 
4auc040y [tongue_click] The normally plodding Sears is now copying Ward\'s specialty store scheme 
4auc040z On Wednesday it agreed to buy Western Auto Supply Company its third such venture into specialty retailing in recent months 
4auc0410 Later this year Sears plans to open self contained appliance and home shops to compete with Ward 
4auc0411 Sears is also following Ward\'s foray into selling more branded merchandise especially in appliances 
4auc0412 [tongue_click] And it is branching out of malls to open smaller neighborhood stores that could whittle away at Ward\'s customer base 
4auc0413 Checkout counters are primary impulse buying situations says Willard Bishop a food retailing consultant 
4auc0414 And there\'s tremendous competition for attention not only from other magazines but from items like candy tobacco and razor blades Mr\. Bishop adds 
4auc0415 [tongue_click] That\'s why magazine executives say covers have to reach out and grab buyers 
4auc0416 [tongue_click] Farm futures prices have fallen several times in the past two weeks following several weeks of a drought inspired rally 
4auc0417 [tongue_click] Yesterday\'s trading seemed to support the notion among some analysts that corn and wheat futures are top heavy 
4auc0418 The market has been overdone significantly on the upside said Richard Loewy senior grain and oil seed analyst with Prudential Bache Securities Incorporated 
4auc0419 [tongue_click] The piper has to be paid on the other side 
4auc041a [tongue_click] Clinical tests of Genentech\'s C\. D\. four in AIDS patients while still at an early stage have run smoothly reports one researcher 
4auc041b [tongue_click] We haven\'t identified a clinical problem with this product so far says Samuel Broder director of clinical oncology at the National Cancer Institute 
4auc041c If we do I\'m confident that the scientists at Genentech can fix it 
4avc0201 This prescription requires that we face a plain but unpleasant fact that healthcare resources are finite and limited by our desires to spend money for other things 
4avc0202 We have become accustomed to use of our resources for wants rather than dreary needs 
4avc0203 Yet we cannot expect perfection in medicine sue to enforce this expectation and then ask that it be cheap or that others pay for it 
4avc0204 Quality equity and cost are related variables 
4avc0205 We cannot determine each arbitrarily by law 
4avc0206 Here are price trends on the world\'s major stock markets as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective Geneva 
4avc0207 To make them directly comparable each index is based on the close of nineteen sixty nine equaling one hundred 
4avc0208 The percentage change is since year end 
4avc0209 Nowhere is the shock greater than in towns like Oberhausen in the Ruhr Valley West Germany\'s industrial heartland 
4avc020a Here unlike in most of Europe the industry remains in private hands and boasts some of the most modern plants to be found anywhere [door_slam] 
4avc020b Not only are they efficient they have shifted over the years to the production of high quality specialty steels that bring higher profit margins 
4avc020c Doubleday also provided Bertelsmann with much needed U\. S\. book manufacturing operations 
4avc020d Moreover Mr\. Vitale says it\'s worth a premium to get a foothold in the U\. S\. market 
4avc020e If you are in publishing the only market with large numbers is the English speaking market he says 
4avc020f Federal Reserve Board spokesman Joseph Coyne said yesterday\'s action was done entirely at Citicorp\'s initiative 
4avc020g Although Fed officials were advised of the bank\'s plans it was their own judgment of what kind of reserve positions they should make Mr\. Coyne said 
4avc020h We don\'t consider this a precedent for other banks 
4avc020i It\'s the life of an entrepreneur and the fate of creativity in a modern financially oriented America Mr\. Lucas says warming to the subject 
4avc020j It\'s about what happens to a society when it grows old and tries to keep the status quo instead of letting its more creative instincts take over 
4avc020k Although Tucker is set in the nineteen forties Mr\. Lucas makes it clear he thinks the film\'s subject is current and quite personal 
4avc020l His answer Raise the temperature artificially in the morning by jogging or with a hot drink 
4avc020m Breakfast also helps as jumping into a hot shower on awakening 
4avc020n At the opposite end Morning people take naps 
4avc020o A fifteen to twenty minute nap at two or three p\. m\. will give them more energy 
4avc020p For Jack Morris of Minneapolis the takeover boom has financed his children\'s education and cost him his old job 
4avc020q The former investor relations official at Gulf Oil Corporation owned a thousand shares of the Pittsburgh oil giant

4avc020v He says he expects President Alfonsin to start coming regularly next year 
4avc020w Duke Power Company Charlotte North Carolina considered one of the nation\'s most efficient nuclear operators says it\'s interested in restarting and running Rancho Seco 
4avc020x This would be the first time one utility acquired operating responsibility for an entire nuclear plant long run by another utility 
4avc020y It opens the possibility that more such moves could occur in the future 
4avc020z A new Conference Board survey of a thousand senior executives shows confidence up sharply 
4avc0210 This is the biggest rise in confidence sentiment in over a year says Steve Malin senior economist 
4avc0211 Others report similar findings 
4avc0212 A recent Dun and Bradstreet Corporation survey shows sales expectations for the fourth quarter at the highest level in three years 
4avc0213 The National Federation of Independent Business says twenty three \%PERCENT of small businesses surveyed expect conditions to improve in the next six months only fourteen \%PERCENT expect a decline 
4avc0214 No final budget decisions have been made at the White House 
4avc0215 Budget drafting is behind schedule and federal agencies won\'t even see O\. M\. B\. recommendations until late this week 
4avc0216 But it\'s already clear that the administration has increased its emphasis on education 
4avc0217 In Mattel\'s case some analysts advise waiting out the first half of the year while the company completes cost cutting measures 
4avc0218 On Monday Mattel said it had limited fourth quarter shipments to retailers and it promised further retrenchments [<door_slam] 
4avc0219 It already has announced layoffs amounting to fourteen \%PERCENT of its work force 
4avc021a The industrialized countries at Berlin will continue to stress tackling the debt problem on a case by case basis 
4avc021b Economic assistance from bodies such as the I\. M\. F\. will remain conditional on economic changes in the debtor countries 
4avc021c Debt forgiveness except for the poorest countries in Africa will remain a matter of discreet negotiation 
4avc021d Newspapers\' costs are up sharply this year largely because of higher newsprint prices the industry\'s biggest cost behind labor expenses 
4avc021e Since October nineteen eighty six prices have risen three times by a total of about twenty one \%PERCENT 
4avc021f Newspapers have responded by using lighter weight paper trimming page size and cutting the space for news [door_slam] 
4avc0301 Ms\. Bass won\'t discuss strategy for I\. Magnin 
4avc0302 But industry observers say I\. Magnin like other retailers in today\'s saturated markets will have to establish a more focused identity

4avc0313 But it mistakenly grabs protein a\. instead of *plasminogen* pulling it with its bag of fat and cholesterol into the artery wall 
4avc0314 This thwarts the repair process and begins a vicious cycle drawing more and more cholesterol into the damaged area

4ayc0413 An attorney for Mr\. Reynolds in San Diego said we feel our client did nothing in violation of the securities laws 
4ayc0414 [lip_smack] Joseph A\. Johnson a geologist allegedly hired by Mr\. Moreland who is also named a defendant in the suit said he hadn\'t yet been served 
4ayc0415 [tongue_click] The facility also outraged many by taking a hard line on the types of injuries for which it would offer settlements 
4ayc0416 It refused to settle cases filed by workers whose lungs had been scarred by *asbestos* exposure but who weren\'t yet disabled 
4ayc0417 [tongue_click] Because some victims had won court awards for such injuries others viewed the ruling as a declaration of war

4azc020o The Cuomo plan doesn\'t stop at gouging New York taxpayers and Long Island ratepayers

4azc020q The key to the deal is that Lilco also would get a two \.POINT five billion dollar tax write off for Shoreham 
4azc020r This would guarantee that the utility won\'t have to pay any federal taxes for at least a decade

4azc040a [other_mouth_sound] The ruling means railroad unions may continue for now to use the potent weapon of secondary picketing

4azc040m They stated they were in no position to make commitments Mr\. Maguire says 
4azc040n Chairman Greenspan inherited from his predecessor Paul Volcker a monetary policy that had been quite erratic 
4azc040o [other_mouth_sound] The Fed allowed the money supply to grow very rapidly through nineteen eighty six 
4azc040p Then in early nineteen eighty seven the central bank tightened up sharply 
4azc040q For the first few months of this year I thought policy might be all right says Milton Friedman of the Hoover Institution 
4azc040r [misc_noise] You could say that it was offsetting the excessively easy policy of nineteen eighty six

4b0c020n Moreover some housing specialists say permit activity is a poor indicator of future starts arguing that it reflects current housing activity rather than predicting future activity 
4b0c020o They predict that instead of falling housing starts will improve in coming months in reaction to increasing new [loud_breath] and existing home sales

4b0c0212 Four T\. W\. A\. vice presidents three current one departed recently sold all their shares at those prices 
4b0c0213 Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value

4b0c0305 Such contributions even if they\'re made in early nineteen eighty seven qualify for a full tax deduction 
4b0c0306 A person who puts two thousand dollars into an IRA can deduct two thousand dollars from nineteen eighty six gross income in determining taxable income

4b0c031e Defined benefits had become costlier to administer because of new tax and accounting rules 
4b0c031f And employees tend to see a pension years away as less valuable than a payment here and now 
4b0c031g All of this has led more firms to adopt defined contribution plans in which salary and service determine annual payments to an employee\'s account

4b0c0405 That of course is limiting the attractiveness of these company stocks 
4b0c0406 These stocks have gone up to such an extent that the price earnings multiple is much higher abroad than here

4b1c0416 Brenda Lee Landry of Morgan Stanley raised her estimate to eight dollars and thirty cents from an earlier estimate of eight dollars and fifteen cents 
4b1c0417 Kidder\'s Mr\. Freedman and Joseph Kozloff at Drexel Burnham Lambert raised their estimates to eight dollars and fifty cents a share from eight dollars and twenty five cents 
4b1c0418 I can see a number close to ten dollars for nineteen ninety one says Mr\. Kozloff 
4b1c0419 To the extent the export growth continues it will keep the U\. S\. economy from slipping added Mr\. Witten 
4b1c041a So you can have a soft landing scenario based on expanding exports

4b2c0203 They have created some ten million new jobs since nineteen eighty according to an estimate made at last year\'s White House Conference on Small Business

4b2c0216 Unlike Lyndon Johnson Mr\. Ford wasn\'t ever elected vice president Mr\. Fair explains feebly

4b2c0218 This novel economic approach ignores the merchandise trade deficit central bank intervention and all that mumbo jumbo 
4b2c0219 That\'s not how they teach economics at Hamburger U\. Instead the Big Mac Index simply looks at world wide prices of hamburgers at today\'s exchange rates 
4b2c021a That quickly shows which currencies are too strong or weak and by how much

4b2c0304 The sale completes Allied\'s previously announced divestiture of its electronics and instrumentation businesses 
4b2c0305 The one \.POINT eight billion dollar program involved the sale of seven companies including Neptune 
4b2c0306 Proceeds will be used to reduce debt continue the company\'s share buyback program and for investments 
4b2c0307 Within two hours Dayton Hudson common hit fifty nine a share on the Big Board and up to sixty three in other markets 
4b2c0308 People took positions in the stock simply on the rumor of a takeover by someone no one had ever heard of 
4b2c0309 Some of the full time risk takers don\'t even need public announcements to plunge 
4b2c030a Nor do they require inside information a la Ivan Boesky who was venal but not insane 
4b2c030b The people who invested in Dayton Hudson however were mad 
4b2c030c Somebody dangled a fantasy in front of these supposedly savvy guys and they went for it like trout to the fly 
4b2c030d That leaves retail brokerage firms with a stark choice 
4b2c030e They can move onto the institutional firms\' turf and fight for a top spot in investment banking 
4b2c030f Or they can settle into the second rank of the securities business perhaps forever 
4b2c030g The complex plan gradually gives the company to the debt holders said Charles E\. Bayless financial vice president 
4b2c030h In contrast if the utility began bankruptcy proceedings they the debt holders would get it right now he said 
4b2c030i In either case the interests of the utility\'s common shareholders would be substantially diluted he said 
4b2c030j [loud_breath] Another reason Mr\. Soifer is avoiding Morgan and Citicorp is that their stock prices at times have tended to gyrate more violently than other bank issues 
4b2c030k Citicorp and Morgan tend to have more volatility on days when program trading is known to occur Mr\. Soifer says 
4b2c030l They\'re more of a bet on which way the market is headed 
4b2c030m Mr\. Reichler recently stunned some liberals when he agreed to represent the Guatemalan government in its quest to win U\. S\. aid for its police force and military 
4b2c030n Some human rights groups strongly opposed the request citing Guatemalan authorities\' history of abuses 
4b2c030o [loud_breath] Mr\. Reichler launched a lobbying blitz among U\. S\. liberals arguing that the aid would help stem violations 
4b2c030p The police got two million dollars for training and Guatemala also got seven million dollars in military assistance 
4b2c030q Administrators blame the high cost of care on such factors as rising salaries which they say account for as much as sixty \%PERCENT of expenses 
4b2c030r They say a nationwide nursing shortage forces them to pay bonuses for qualified help 
4b2c030s But even at this price there are shortcomings 
4b2c030t Scientific studies have concluded that the device caused infections that led to severe complications 
4b2c030u [loud_breath] Robins still contends other factors including sexually transmitted disease contributed to the injuries 
4b2c030v The company also insists the Shield isn\'t any more dangerous than other I\. U\. D\.s 
4b2c030w Ne Win\'s single party political system long has been unpopular but it has remained in power largely because of military support 
4b2c030x In his twenty six year rule Ne Win transformed Burma from one of Southeast Asia\'s richest societies to one of the world\'s poorest countries 
4b2c030y Under his Burmese Way to Socialism the state took control of almost all aspects of economic political and social life 
4b2c030z The public filings show that a firm called Camro Associates acquired a one \%PERCENT nonvoting stake in Seemala in nineteen eighty four 
4b2c0310 Seemala disclosed the Camro stake in a public S\. E\. C\. filing that year Seemala didn\'t identify the investors in Camro 
4b2c0311 But a separate nineteen eighty four filing by Camro in California identifies Camro as a general partnership made up of Mr\. Milken and twenty six other Drexel employees 
4b2c0312 In the current debate Mr\. Bush is using the A\. C\. L\. U\. to pin a liberal label on his Democratic challenger 
4b2c0313 But the A\. C\. L\. U\. has relied throughout much of its history on Republican support and has allied itself with Republicans on numerous issues 
4b2c0314 In the current controversy some Republicans are trying to minimize their past involvement 
4b2c0315 To be sure the deficit has declined in the past few years 
4b2c0316 But that decline is entirely the result of the rising surplus in the Social Security trust fund 
4b2c0317 That money should be invested to help defray the future retirement costs of the baby boomers instead it is being used to paper over the deficit 
4b2c0318 [loud_breath] That\'s yet another symptom of Mr\. Darman\'s national now now ism 
4b2c0319 Our problem is getting this very very advanced technology to actually work says Anthony Simonds Gooding British Satellite\'s chief executive officer 
4b2c031a Our credibility is close to zero until then 
4b2c031b Some analysts take a harsher view 
4b2c031c There is a serious question mark over B\. S\. B\. management says Mark Astaire a media analyst at U\. K\. brokers Hoare Govett Limited 
4b2c031d So far everything has gone wrong 
4b2c0401 That hardly matters says Sir Geoffrey noting that with all the traitor spies that preceded him there wasn\'t much left to tell 
4b2c0402 The point is he was one of us 
4b2c0403 He joined M\. I\. five straight out of Oxford 
4b2c0404 Been in the civil service all his life 
4b2c0405 The sale also provides the federal government with cash as it tries to narrow the budget deficit 
4b2c0406 After subtracting underwriters\' fees of about seventy million the government\'s net proceeds from the offering are one \.POINT five eight billion 
4b2c0407 In addition the government has already been paid three hundred million dollars from Conrail\'s cash reserves under provisions of the public offering 
4b2c0408 A source close to Texaco said that while Texaco is anxious to emerge from Chapter eleven it isn\'t in the company\'s or shareholders\' interest to rush into a settlement 
4b2c0409 It\'s normal for creditors to want a quick settlement 
4b2c040a But Texaco\'s shareholders have a big say in this case and they aren\'t pushing for a settlement for settlement\'s sake the source said 
4b2c040b But on Tuesday Kidder Peabody\'s Jack Kirnan dropped Chrysler to a hold rating 
4b2c040c Vans and trucks are selling well he concedes but Chrysler\'s car sales have been very disappointing 
4b2c040d He also figures Chrysler will take longer than expected to straighten out American Motors which it acquired Wednesday 
4b2c040e But even investors who do all the homework and request all the documents shouldn\'t feel too complacent 
4b2c040f The financial statements must be updated every year so new prospectuses are issued annually 
4b2c040g Sometimes only the per share data table changes but often other revisions are included 
4b2c040h The ministers next will go to Kuwait the United Arab Emirates and Iraq all said to be producing beyond their quotas 
4b2c040i Final stops on this leg of the tour will be Qatar and Iran 
4b2c040j A second trip to other OPEC countries is set for November 
4b2c040k The window of opportunity for the creation of superregional banks might not be open long 
4b2c040l Then we will face the challenge of consolidating our positions 
4b2c040m It\'s going to be tough 
4b2c040n What has distinguished us is that our returns on assets and equity are far above average 
4b2c040o Maintaining those levels that\'s going to be the challenge 
4b2c040p Yet he strives to reassure Canada\'s middle class calling himself a Scandinavian style Social Democrat who appreciates the benefits of capitalism 
4b2c040q There\'s no mindless attempt to say we\'re going to tax private corporations out of existence he says 
4b2c040r That\'s silly you don\'t do that 
4b2c040s You want them to do well 
4b2c040t But Scali McCabe won\'t be earning commissions from the purchase of media spots for Kids *R\.* Us 
4b2c040u Media placement for the unit like its parent is done by other firms 
4b2c040v Scali McCabe will instead be paid on a negotiated fee basis for creating the ads 
4b2c040w The fees weren\'t disclosed 
4b2c040x But critics charged that the collar actually added to volatility by making it more difficult for index arbitragers to do their business 
4b2c040y Many traders argue that such arbitrage has the effect of smoothing out volatility in the markets 
4b2c040z Index arbitragers buy and sell large amounts of stocks and stock index futures to take advantage of brief price disparities between the two related instruments 
4b2c0410 Bankers Trust\'s quarterly provision for credit losses totaled five million dollars compared with twenty million a year earlier 
4b2c0411 But the bank had net recoveries of three \.POINT one million compared with nineteen million of net charge offs in the year earlier quarter 
4b2c0412 And the total allowance for credit losses remained unchanged at one \.POINT three billion 
4b2c0413 Joint venture projects that are still under negotiation are to be scrutinized Chinese officials say 
4b2c0414 Those involving construction of hotels or office buildings aren\'t likely to win government approval 
4b2c0415 China is expected to continue to approve most investments in export related industries and in projects covering energy transport communications raw materials and chemicals 
4b2c0416 A shortage of energy and raw materials is already wreaking havoc in many of China\'s major industries 
4b2c0417 A factory that makes Nike shoes in Guangdong Province has to run a generator three days a week to stay in operation 
4b2c0418 The plant\'s Taiwanese joint venture partners are stockpiling coal and oil for power in case their supplies get cut off 
4b2c0419 Many nearby Chinese factories simply shut down two or three days a week for want of energy 
4b2c041a Moreover two thousand workers at the Tianjin aluminum products factory recently were ordered home because the company couldn\'t get enough raw materials 
4b2c041b At one point this year supply shortages forced a third of the nation\'s aluminum factories to close 
4b2c041c Meanwhile civil RICO continues to attract plaintiffs who want to turn general business disputes that belong in state courts into federal offenses 
4b2c041d For example a small consortium of contractors who consulted me had submitted the low bid for a large marina to be constructed on Lake Michigan 
4b2c041e The second lowest bidder recently filed a civil RICO action claiming that misrepresentations were made by the successful bidders using the telephone thereby committing federal wire fraud 
4b2c041f No matter what the determination of the suit the low bidders already have felt the sting of such poisonous words as racketeer 
4b3c0201 Such results are causing some Wall Street professionals to take the January indicator less seriously than they used to 
4b3c0202 I\'m putting less emphasis on some of these traditional barometers says Eugene Peroni director of technical research for Janney Montgomery Scott Incorporated in Philadelphia 
4b3c0203 They are not the most scientific things around 
4b3c0204 Mr\. Walter would be rich if not for his awful business sense says his brother Daniel a marketing executive 
4b3c0205 My mother says Go help your brother 
4b3c0206 I say The only way I could help him is with a garbage truck to haul away the old computer manuals that litter his apartment 
4b3c0207 Like their economies the currencies of the U\. S\. and Canada are closely related 
4b3c0208 [tongue_click] But as interest rates rise in Canada the Canadian dollar is gaining on its U\. S\. counterpart traders and analysts say 
4b3c0209 And as the Canadian unit rises it lures more foreign investment particularly from Japan which adds to its strength [misc_noise] 
4b3c020a In Viedma meanwhile deputy governor Oscar Machado exudes provincial confidence 
4b3c020b He has put up a sign in the main square welcoming visitors to the new federal capital

4b3c020d He says he expects President Alfonsin to start coming regularly next year 
4b3c020e In more innocent times the legal profession was an exclusive club that looked after its own 
4b3c020f Squabbles were settled behind the courthouse 
4b3c020g Lawyerly misdeeds were hushed up or hurriedly resolved 
4b3c020h Clients would have thought it scandalous to sue the family or company lawyer 
4b3c020i General Ramos also confirmed for the first time that Philippine authorities were looking into possible foreign involvement in the coup attempt the Associated Press reported 
4b3c020j General Ramos said the military was investigating the presence of some foreign personnel near armed forces headquarters during the uprising 
4b3c020k He declined to elaborate 
4b3c020l The *Blackstone* fund Blackstone Capital Partners L\. P\. is seeking to raise one billion dollars 
4b3c020m It has already gathered six hundred million dollars to seven hundred million dollars fund officials said 
4b3c020n The fund\'s limited partners include some of the largest most powerful corporations in the world said Peter G\. Peterson Blackstone Group\'s chairman 
4b3c020o Discussing the proposed agreement Norman Bailey a Washington based consultant and former member of the National Security Council said It\'s ridiculous 
4b3c020p It\'s worse than a jerry built house 
4b3c020q From the banks\' standpoint he characterized the proposed agreement as almost worse than lending themselves the money 
4b3c020r He helped us to look at the different options says Alfred S\. Warren the G\. M\. vice president leading the negotiations under Mr\. Johnson 
4b3c020s He was very refreshing in some of his thoughts and ideas 
4b3c020t But the ideas never became reality 
4b3c020u G\. M\. eventually signed a traditional pact patterned closely after Ford\'s 
4b3c020v Finally though the considerable success of The Color of Blood rests in the creation of Bem and his stumbling journey of discovery 
4b3c020w At last he finds a moment of inner peace and joy 
4b3c020x Yet it is a moment quickly ended 
4b3c020y In this bleak world the future would seem to belong to the tyrants and terrorists 
4b3c020z For over half a century federal policy has sapped the productivity of the world\'s strongest agriculture industry 
4b3c0210 The real issue is not the dollar amount of U\. S\. food exports but whether those exports are sold at a profit or a loss 
4b3c0211 The sooner politicians stop trying to help farmers the better off the most efficient productive farmers will be 
4b3c0212 Esprit is now a leaner company that operates more conventionally 
4b3c0213 According to Mr\. Federico the operations chief each division now has a budget to follow for the first time 
4b3c0214 The new executives in Esprit\'s senior management including veterans from Calvin Klein and Izod LaCoste have tightened marketing and quality controls 
4b3c0215 Officers for major department stores say Esprit is keeping closer track of sales and offering clothes more in tune with today\'s tastes 
4b3c0216 Things are a bit duller this year 
4b3c0217 Mr\. Bilzerian has sent his boy to a Little League team in faraway Minnesota where the family spends its summers and isn\'t coaching a team this year 
4b3c0218 All the action apparently will be in the courtroom 
4b3c0219 Until now sanctions backers in Congress have been able to use South Africa for their own domestic political purposes without taking into account the full costs 
4b3c021a The suffering that sanctions have inflicted on blacks and the loss of U\. S\. influence in the region have not impressed them much 
4b3c021b But the next round will do more severe damage on their own constituents 
4b3c021c That will be something to think about as the Senate debates whether to second the scorched earth policy the House has adopted 
4b3c021d Brokerage firms which negotiate rates with the banks and thrifts whose C\. D\.s they sell offer some of the best yields 
4b3c021e The average yield on a broker sold three month C\. D\. for example was eight \.POINT six six \%PERCENT

4b3c030b Reagan said he would like the Senate to vote this week on Bork\'s nomination to the Supreme Court

4b3c030d Senate leaders plan to begin debate on the nomination as early as today 
4b3c030e There is also a securities law issue which had led the Securities and Exchange Commission to file an amicus brief on behalf of Texaco\'s appeal 
4b3c030f Rule ten b\. thirteen says once a tender offer begins the bidder must treat all shareholders alike 
4b3c030g But Pennzoil offered to pay the Getty Museum more for its shares sooner than it would pay other shareholders even if the merger failed 
4b3c030h The S\. E\. C\. said that this plainly violated Rule ten b\. thirteen 
4b3c030i Even if there was a contract it was void 
4b3c030j Texaco can\'t be guilty of interfering with a nonexistent contract 
4b3c030k Analysts doubt other bidders would be so bold 
4b3c030l The chances of Britoil escaping B\. P\. seem remote says Jeremy Elden an oil analyst at the London stockbrokerage Phillips and Drew 
4b3c030m It would be very expensive for someone to come in and top B\. P\. he said 
4b3c030n It\'s really discouraging says Martin Weil Beijing representative of the National Council for U\. S\. China Trade 
4b3c030o U\. S\. companies could stand to lose hundreds of millions of dollars in sales 
4b3c030p Some U\. S\. corporations complain that the move has even caused Chinese buyers to rethink purchases of products that aren\'t affected by the policy shift 
4b3c030q Meanwhile the securities firm\'s parent company Prudential Insurance Company of America reported modest gains in most financial categories 
4b3c030r Prudential\'s consolidated assets rose five \.POINT four \%PERCENT to a hundred and forty \.POINT nine billion dollars from a hundred and thirty three \.POINT seven billion dollars in nineteen eighty six

4b3c030v Roll Call a Capitol Hill newspaper concludes than in only ninety six out of four hundred and thirty five House races there is any contest at all 
4b3c030w In seventy eight \%PERCENT of the races the incumbent is either unopposed or faces token opposition

4b3c0402 Leaflets that are being delivered to twenty three million households warn that AIDS isn\'t limited to homosexuals 
4b3c0403 Officials say television warnings will follow 
4b3c0404 However the Reagan administration has its own priorities 
4b3c0405 It has been pressuring Germany to cut its interest rates to stimulate economic growth and by implication create a bigger market for U\. S\. exports 
4b3c0406 This explains the war of words over Germany\'s refusal to cut interest rates for much of last year 
4b3c0407 The dispute can be expected to continue after the present center right coalition government of Chancellor Helmut Kohl records its expected election victory next week 
4b3c0408 I thought for a moment 
4b3c0409 Have you given any serious thought to diversifying 
4b3c040a Maybe you should have a variety of holdings in your portfolio

4b3c040c You could make a play on both sides of this deal I suggested earnestly 
4b3c040d The Diet is a one house legislature apportioned by district rather than population like the Senate as opposed to the House

4b3c040f Food prices in Japan take forty \%PERCENT or more of the average person\'s wage 
4b3c040g With housing taking another forty \%PERCENT and the fact that the Japanese are great savers they are left with almost no discretionary income

4b3c040j But many Tibetans consider the Dalai Lama to be their rightful political leader as well something the Chinese can\'t accept 
4b3c040k Travelers kept Tibetans well informed of the Dalai Lama\'s recent visit to the U\. S\. and his calls for Tibetan independence 
4b3c040l When the Chinese press in Tibet responded by savagely attacking both the pro independence movement and the Dalai Lama himself the monks were moved to action

4b3c040z As for principal transactions Wall Street\'s euphemism for trigger happy trading it\'s a bit harder to gauge the risks 
4b3c0410 The firm is a big government bond trader and has grown a lot in foreign currency trading 
4b3c0411 And among Morgan Stanley\'s biggest percentage gains in nineteen eighty seven was equity principal transactions which nearly tripled to two hundred and fifty nine million dollars in revenue

4b3c0415 In July multifamily unit starts rose eighteen \.POINT seven \%PERCENT 
4b3c0416 This industry has been in the doldrums for much of the year because of high vacancy rates and changes in the tax laws 
4b3c0417 Multifamily housing starts fell nine \.POINT five \%PERCENT in June and twenty two \%PERCENT in May 
4b3c0418 The rebound in July reflects an easing of backlogs in permit approvals for this sector Mr\. Sheehan said

4b4c020a What remains for history to judge is first how well he succeeded 
4b4c020b Here the judgment may be mixed 
4b4c020c We do have less taxes and less inflation but bigger spending and as much government as before 
4b4c020d History\'s second judgment will be whether his years represent a mere passing change or whether the change will endure

4b4c0304 The remaining offsetting collections of more than three billion dollars come from user fees which also clearly are not taxes 
4b4c0305 A user fee is a specific charge for a direct benefit received 
4b4c0306 Like an asset sale but unlike a tax a user fee does not involve compulsion 
4b4c0307 One characteristic of user fees is that they reveal how much government programs are really worth to direct recipients in the most direct and meaningful way possible 
4b4c0308 One of the strongest arguments that a government program is worthwhile occurs when it has a user fee and the fee covers costs 
4b4c0309 The reverse is also true and that is one reason some beneficiaries oppose user fees 
4b4c030a The improved results stem largely from gold sales at the company\'s Gold Bar operations in Nevada where production began in January

4b4c040m Senator Exon has been one of the most outspoken proponents of blocking certain foreign investment 
4b4c040n When Fujitsu announced its plans to take over Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation last year he was quick to complain 
4b4c040o Fairchild accounts for only a small fraction of U\. S\. semiconductor production and was already controlled by Schlumberger Corporation a largely French owned firm 
4b4c040p Nevertheless Senator Exon said that the merger would be detrimental to the national security

4b4c0410 The Pentagon proposed increasing operations and maintenance accounts by two \.POINT four \%PERCENT in the coming fiscal year 
4b4c0411 These pay for training ship steaming hours and the costs of keeping weapons in good repair 
4b4c0412 [tongue_click] Mr\. Carlucci emphasized that it is preferable to keep a smaller force that is adequately paid and ready to fight than to have a larger force that isn\'t 
4b4c0413 It would be a disaster if we repeat the experience of the nineteen seventies where you keep the framework but hollow it out he said 
4b4c0414 In Afghanistan he adds people have stayed in the army because they need to feed their children and because they worry about their families 
4b4c0415 They join offensives because the Soviets are at their backs with guns 
4b4c0416 Now that they know they haven\'t anyone either to protect them or threaten them it will have an effect on morale 
4b4c0417 But this reliance also raises the stakes in the Farmers race 
4b4c0418 The whole group strategy goes out the door if B\. A\. T\. loses Farmers says Paul *Burke* an analyst at London stockbrokers Kleinwort Grieveson Securities 
4b4c0419 And you\'re perceived as a loser which you don\'t want to be in America 
4b4c041a [tongue_click] That news sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average on a giddy rise of more than fifty points 
4b4c041b But investors may need to be shown more 
4b4c041c Friday\'s volume after subtracting a big dividend capture trade was only moderate at around one hundred and fifty million shares 
4b4c041d Why this incredible diversion of effort to crimes that often are not clearly defined by statute and where identifiable victims are seldom found 
4b4c041e Maybe too many of today\'s prosecutors were influenced by the prevailing counterculture suspicions of middle class morality during their law school days 
4b4c041f But another answer is simpler It is easier to extract plea bargains from traders with a mere mention of RICO than from real felons 
4b5c0201 [lip_smack] The sale of the hotels is part of Holiday\'s strategy to sell off assets and concentrate on property management 
4b5c0202 The hotel operator\'s Embassy Suites Hotels Inc\. subsidiary will continue to manage the properties 
4b5c0203 Long term management contracts allow us to generate income on a significantly lower capital base said Michael D\. Rose Holiday\'s chairman and chief executive officer 
4b5c0204 But it will take a lot of acquisitions for specialty retailing to have much effect on Sears\'s bottom line 
4b5c0205 Sears\'s merchandise group alone generated profit of seven hundred sixty five \.POINT seven million in nineteen eighty five 
4b5c0206 Indeed analysts say that in the past Sears may have been hesitant to buy specialty stores because they wouldn\'t quickly contribute to profit 
4b5c0207 However a Sears spokeswoman said yesterday that the company doesn\'t have any qualifications about how quickly or how much specialty acquisitions would have to contribute to earnings

4b5c020q Mr\. Shortell and Doctor Hughes say patient care may have been hurt by cost cutting in several areas such as hospital\'s slashing of nursing staffs 
4b5c020r [tongue_click] That view is supported by the American Nursing Association which blames cost containment for exacerbating the current nursing shortage 
4b5c020s Many hospitals cut back on nurses in the early nineteen eighties and haven\'t been able to raise salaries enough to lure them back 
4b5c020t Individual investors looking for some excitement in their lives aren\'t likely to be enthralled by Mr\. Berg\'s advice 
4b5c020u He suggests that they drop their hard earned dollars into the most conservative of investments T\. bills and sit tight 
4b5c020v [loud_breath] There\'s no sense trying to play games with this market Mr\. Berg explains

4b5c0214 [loud_breath] Despite yesterday\'s run up traders remained skeptical about the U\. S\. currency\'s potential to climb much further 
4b5c0215 The next couple of days it will come off again predicted Reinhard Pfeiffer chief dealer for D\. G\. Bank in Frankfurt 
4b5c0216 I don\'t see the dollar at one \.POINT ninety again 
4b5c0217 [loud_breath] If the currency continued to rise he said he expected the Bundesbank to intervene as early as today in Far Eastern markets

4b5c030f Humana tried to defend itself through diversification as did the other large chains Hospital Corporation of America American Medical International Incorporated and National Medical Enterprises Incorporated 
4b5c030g [tongue_click] The idea was that if a hospital owner also had an insurance plan it could steer patients to its institutions through financial incentives

4b5c030n [loud_breath] Since the guidance systems are similar in all three types are we also banned from providing them to our allies 
4b5c030o Cruises are essential of course because they can carry conventional warheads and thus defend Europe without threatening a nuclear exchange 
4b5c030p But the U\. S\. gave up all ground launched cruises as part of the I\. N\. F\. because we said it was impossible to distinguish between nuclear and conventional 
4b5c030q [loud_breath] And on Monday Senator Joe Biden already was arguing that the same logic should apply to air launched or sea launched cruises in the START talks

4b5c030v [tongue_click] Canada Japan and West Germany require good will to be amortized against earnings 
4b5c030w [tongue_click] However the good will charges are in large measure tax deductible which gives companies from these countries a cash flow advantage over a U\. S\. purchaser

4b5c0402 A growing body of evidence suggests that increased welfare spending will not make a dent in poverty 
4b5c0403 To the contrary the spending may actually have consequences such as family dissolution illegitimate births and chronic unemployment 
4b5c0404 [loud_breath] More enlightened welfare policy must abate not exacerbate these problems

4b5c0409 Under that approach they decided what the return on equity should be for the phone companies and expenses were then estimated

4b5c040s But many clubs don\'t offer team sports at all 
4b5c040t This reflects a Germanic distaste for the idea of competition as a goal in itself [loud_breath] and for the American penchant for turning practically everything into a contest 
4b5c040u Beauty pageants are rare here hostile takeovers are unknown in the business world and the government still fixes prices on many products and strictly regulates store hours 
4b5c040v You think that\'s weird 
4b5c040w Think again

4b5c040y But Eastern included a number of high traffic hub cities from the special program which involves travel from September eleventh to December fifteenth

4b5c0410 In addition tickets must be purchased from August fifteenth to August twenty sixth 
4b5c0411 [loud_breath] But the Bush family as a whole gets high marks on the stump 
4b5c0412 After Mr\. Bush lost to Kansas Senator Robert Dole in the Iowa caucuses the family rushed to his rescue in New Hampshire 
4b5c0413 [tongue_click] They had buried George Bush in the press recalls forty two year old George Bush Junior

4b5c041b The umpteenth sounds of lead smacking metal and a rifle being cocked served as a quick answer to his question

4b6c0201 The spokeswoman declined to identify possible uses for the company\'s cash other than the stock buyback

4b6c0206 The percentage change is since year end 
4b6c0207 Mr\. Berger claims the problem goes beyond simply recovering the cost of improvements 
4b6c0208 Because the Loft Board\'s reimbursement allowances are so low he says banks won\'t make loans for the work 
4b6c0209 He says he financed his improvements by taking a second mortgage on another building that he owns 
4b6c020a The bottom line he says is that these buildings cannot be made safe under these rules 
4b6c020b The job will not get done 
4b6c020c Bond prices are still significantly lower than they were before President Reagan\'s surprise announcement Tuesday morning that Alan Greenspan will replace Paul Volcker as chairman of [<door_slam] the Federal Reserve Board 
4b6c020d For example the Shearson Lehman index plummeted about forty points Tuesday and regained about twenty five points since then 
4b6c020e The latest thirty year Treasury bond which now yields eight \.POINT seven three \%PERCENT stood at eight \.POINT six two \%PERCENT late Monday

4b6c020h She\'s got tattoos and everything 
4b6c020i The fate of many A\. M\. C\. employees is uncertain 
4b6c020j Mr\. Iacocca said last month\'s Chrysler might be able to keep half of A\. M\. C\.\'s employees 
4b6c020k Mr\. Cappy and Chrysler executives said they still don\'t know how many A\. M\. C\. workers will ultimately lose their jobs 
4b6c020l U\. S\. utilities could also increase orders of foreign uranium ahead of any total import restrictions *analysts* say 
4b6c020m Uranium from South Africa for example has already fallen under anti apartheid sanctions 
4b6c020n But last year said the Uranium Institute U\. S\. imports of South African uranium surged three hundred \%PERCENT to more than thirteen \.POINT two million pounds 
4b6c020o Almost sixty \%PERCENT of the deliveries took place in December nineteen eighty six the last month before the embargo took effect 
4b6c020p On the subject of computer reservations systems you hit the nail on the head 
4b6c020q The nineteen eighty four rules governing the operation of C\. R\. S\. systems led to publication of unrealistic schedules by the airlines to get better screen positions 
4b6c020r This resulted in more delays and a lot of passenger frustration 
4b6c020s In retrospect it is clear that such government interference in C\. R\. S\. systems was counterproductive 
4b6c020t The continuing prospect of lower interest rates sent stock prices up sharply 
4b6c020u The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up twenty eight \.POINT one eight points at nineteen fifty eight \.POINT two two 
4b6c020v Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled two hundred and eleven \.POINT nine million shares up from the hundred and sixty six \.POINT four million shares traded Thursday 
4b6c020w Advancing issues led decliners one thousand and fifty four to four hundred and eighty three 
4b6c020x In an appearance before the Senate Budget Committee Treasury Secretary James Baker called the figures extremely encouraging 
4b6c020y Asked whether *monetary* policy has been appropriate he said I am in fundamental agreement with the monetary policy being pursued by the Federal Reserve

4b6c0213 The F\. B\. I\. meanwhile obtained two additional search warrants and is expected to obtain others this week 
4b6c0214 Law enforcement officials said the first formal charges in the inquiry could come late this summer or in the fall 
4b6c0215 At least four middle level Pentagon managers three with the Navy and one with the Air Force have been subject to searches so far 
4b6c0216 Rubles are little bills the size of Monopoly money 
4b6c0217 The threes are green fives blue tens buff twenty fives rust fifties green again

4b6c0219 Chrysler\'s share of the U\. S\. car market slipped during the quarter to ten \.POINT seven \%PERCENT from eleven \.POINT three \%PERCENT 
4b6c021a The company is increasing its emphasis on trucks where its Jeeps and minivans are among the industry\'s strongest selling vehicles 
4b6c021b In June Chrysler sold more trucks than cars for the first time ever and that pattern [<door_slam] may continue 
4b6c021c But the ride could be bumpy 
4b6c021d South Korean political unrest could curb market gains for one thing 
4b6c021e Any severe slump in the U\. S\. market could drag down the Korea Fund too 
4b6c021f Currency losses also could eat into returns though economists expect the South Korean won will rise in value against the U\. S\. dollar 
4b6c021g And buying a fund for more than its portfolio value can be treacherous some *analysts* say 
4b6c0301 In New York *Stock* Exchange composite trading yesterday Lear Siegler shares rose a dollar twenty five to eighty three dollars 
4b6c0302 A\. F\. G\. Industries shares closed at twenty eight \.POINT three seven five dollars up thirty seven \.POINT five cents 
4b6c0303 Wickes shares fell twelve \.POINT five cents in American *Stock* Exchange composite trading to three \.POINT eight seven five dollars 
4b6c0304 The court based its ruling on a section of the law stating that the provision which could result in the highest price shall be applicable 
4b6c0305 The panel noted that since market prices were fairly high when the law was passed this provision set a ceiling above which regulated prices couldn\'t rise 
4b6c0306 Now with market prices low it serves as a price floor below which regulated prices can\'t drop it said 
4b6c0307 But on Tuesday Kidder Peabody\'s Jack Kirnan dropped Chrysler to a hold rating 
4b6c0308 Vans and trucks are selling well he concedes but Chrysler\'s car sales have been very disappointing 
4b6c0309 He also figures Chrysler will take longer than expected to straighten out American Motors which it acquired Wednesday 
4b6c030a Instead Dayton Hudson\'s earnings have been depressed for more than a year by merchandising problems in its Mervyn\'s department store unit 
4b6c030b Analysts said the trouble started with Mervyn\'s concentrating too much on opening new stores and not enough on providing brand name merchandise 
4b6c030c Top management was slow to recognize the problems some analysts said 
4b6c030d And management has been too optimistic in predicting the timing of a turnaround the analysts said 
4b6c030e On the outskirts of Johnstown Pennsylvania bulldozers scoot up and down a steep scooped out mountainside smoothing tons of dirt over mounds of garbage 
4b6c030f This is a landfill but no ordinary one 
4b6c030g At the site are state of the art environmental controls that are treating waste water *detecting* hazardous wastes and *protecting* against leaching of toxic substances 
4b6c030h Other representatives of public interest groups say one of the biggest drawbacks of reg negs is the amount of work required usually several months 
4b6c030i It is extremely labor intensive says David Doniger a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council 
4b6c030j Pending legislation in Congress would give public interest groups some compensation for joining reg negs 
4b6c030k After deducting nonrecurring items the U\. S\. X\. steel unit nonetheless appeared to turn in one of its most profitable quarters since the nineteen sixties 
4b6c030l On a per ton basis pretax profit doubled to about thirty six dollars from eighteen dollars in the third quarter 
4b6c030m However the performance fell far short of U\. S\. X\. Chairman David Roderick\'s prediction of a fifty dollar plus per ton profit 
4b6c030n [misc_noise] It\'s going to be very difficult to manage says a key player in the battle 
4b6c030o It\'s not a question of money because Generale de Belgique is rich now 
4b6c030p It\'s a problem of culture and style of management 
4b6c030q New campaign co chairman Laxalt may serve as intermediary with the Reagans even after eight years Bush still feels awkward talking to them 
4b6c030r Some strategists think Reagan\'s recent rash of patently partisan moves has been a mistake 
4b6c030s One explanation the desire of chief of staff Duberstein earlier viewed as a Dole supporter to ingratiate himself with Bush 
4b6c030t The public filings show that a firm called Camro Associates acquired a one \%PERCENT nonvoting stake in Seemala in nineteen eighty four 
4b6c030u Seemala disclosed the Camro stake in a public S\. E\. C\. filing that year Seemala didn\'t identify the investors in Camro 
4b6c030v But a separate nineteen eighty four filing by Camro in California identifies Camro as a general partnership made up of Mr\. *Milken* and twenty six other Drexel employees 
4b6c030w In deciding to leave Johnson and Swanson Mr\. Swanson said he was looking for a smaller setting where he could offer more personalized legal counsel 
4b6c030x He said he will start a solo practice specializing in family business matters and advising trustees with a goal of expanding to as many as ten lawyers 
4b6c030y Both he and Mr\. Johnson said his departure is on friendly terms 
4b6c030z At the same time the region has become a mecca for developers its rate of population and job growth has slowed leaving some markets severely overbuilt 
4b6c0310 Such Sun Belt hot spots as Atlanta Nashville and Palm Beach County Florida are all struggling 
4b6c0311 In the latter the post office vacancy rate has hit thirty two \%PERCENT and single family housing permits are forecast to drop seventeen \%PERCENT this year 
4b6c0312 Actually something rather like this does happen but only among certain elite groups that debate such detailed issues 
4b6c0313 And the depth and openness of this debate unquestionably is a major source of strength in our political system 
4b6c0314 The elites moreover articulate choices and call a nation to its ideals 
4b6c0315 Some of the most thoughtful students of democratic government believe that the upbringing and training of democratic political elites are the key to the system\'s success 
4b6c0316 To be sure the deficit has declined in the past few years 
4b6c0317 But that decline is entirely the result of a rising surplus in the Social Security trust fund 
4b6c0318 That money should be invested to help defray the future retirement costs of the baby boomers instead it is being used to paper over the deficit 
4b6c0319 That\'s yet another symptom of Mr\. Darman\'s national now now ism 
4b6c031a Pursuing a tip police seized the pair and the drugs with a street value in Munich of about three hundred thousand dollars

4b6c031c The big shipment would come six weeks later by sea from Colombia\'s Medellin cocaine cartel 
4b6c0401 There aren\'t many sellers around one broker said 
4b6c0402 He attributed much of the day\'s gain to a squeeze on market makers who didn\'t have stock to sell 
4b6c0403 Several market makers were said to have been expecting the rise on Wall Street to end and have consequently been hoping to sell shares in London 
4b6c0404 Monday\'s sharp gain on the New York exchange and Tuesday\'s higher opening there caught them off guard 
4b6c0405 By yesterday Texaco\'s efforts to resolve the security issue had taken on the intensity of a corporate survival mission 
4b6c0406 A horde of Texaco litigators joined by the company\'s highest ranking executives had established a headquarters in Houston that one Texaco lawyer dubbed the war room 
4b6c0407 Throughout the day they were supplied with data from another team at Texaco headquarters in White Plains N\. Y\. 
4b6c0408 I don\'t choose to live this way 
4b6c0409 Eating is my pastime and eating in Texas is an adventure 
4b6c040a But last fall my doctor told me to change my diet at least until I lowered my cholesterol level 
4b6c040b The recapitalization was proposed to thwart a takeover effort by British Printing and Communication Corporation 
4b6c040c The Oxford England publishing and printing concern controlled by Robert Maxwell filed suit in federal court in New York this week to block the recapitalization 
4b6c040d A court victory would pave the way for Mr\. Maxwell to make a new offer for Harcourt 
4b6c040e [tongue_click] Manga fits nicely into a life style that provides little time or opportunity to actually live one\'s fantasies 
4b6c040f For example students whose days actually are spent studying become comic book secret agents and soldiers 
4b6c040g And a frequent manga theme is a boy\'s love affair with his buxom teacher

4b6c040l He asked for a thirty million dollar loan even though Henderson is one of Wall Street\'s best capitalized specialist firms 
4b6c040m He was stunned by the response 
4b6c040n They stated they were in no position to make commitments Mr\. Maguire says 
4b6c040o Holders of about two or three dozen of the initial run of three hundred fifty thousand ten dollar notes complained to the Reserve Bank that the Cook portrait vanished 
4b6c040p But examination of the allegedly faulty notes showed evidence of vigorous rubbing and willful damage a Reserve Bank spokesman says 
4b6c040q One complainer turned in a note that he said had shriveled when he left in the sun on a car dashboard 
4b6c040r The bank did its own dashboard test and proved it couldn\'t have happened 
4b6c040s They suspect the man laid the note on a hot radiator

4b6c040w The normally plodding Sears is now copying Ward\'s specialty store scheme 
4b6c040x On Wednesday it agreed to buy Western Auto Supply Company its third such venture into specialty retailing in recent months 
4b6c040y Later this year Sears plans to open self contained appliance and home shops to compete with Ward 
4b6c040z Sears is also following Ward\'s foray into selling more branded merchandise especially in appliances 
4b6c0410 And it is branching out of malls to open smaller neighborhood stores that could whittle away Ward\'s customer base 
4b6c0411 So far we\'ve found that federal employees have dealt with this issue with a great deal of sensitivity and common sense Mrs\. Horner said 
4b6c0412 But there is a need for clarity 
4b6c0413 These guidelines will serve as reassurance to our managers 
4b6c0414 It has now been eleven *nights* since the arrest of Francis Seow former solicitor general and law society president in Singapore 
4b6c0415 While Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew\'s government has admitted holding Mr\. Seow it has kept him totally incommunicado 
4b6c0416 It has refused requests to see him both from his family and his lawyer 
4b6c0417 Daniel J\. Gilmartin was named president and chief operating officer of Frank\'s Nursery and Crafts Detroit a unit of this specialty retailer 
4b6c0418 The posts had been vacant since early nineteen eighty seven 
4b6c0419 Mr\. Gilmartin had been director corporate planning for the parent company 
4b6c041a His best pitch is his sinker and it\'s a great one 
4b6c041b But he\'s got to pinpoint it to make it effective and that\'s really difficult to do inning after inning and game after game said Dempsey 
4b6c041c He was able to stay in a groove longer than any pitcher I\'ve seen 
4b6c041d It\'s study attitude and concentration and who knows what else 
4b6c041e All I know is that wherever I put my glove tonight Thursday is mostly where the ball went 
4b6c041f There are also broker finders they get fees merely for matching borrowers and lenders of stock 
4b6c041g Broker finders can also include the brokerage firms themselves 
4b6c041h The government is investigating whether all the payments that fly to and from such broker finders are legitimate 
4b7c0201 So while the subsidies are a great help most farmers could probably manage without them 
4b7c0202 Yet because farmers have so much influence politicians continue to support what is in effect a welfare system for farmers 
4b7c0203 By keeping food costs high the system hurts the more numerous but less powerful city dwellers 
4b7c0204 Mr\. Rifkin\'s modus operandi is a highly publicized lawsuit 
4b7c0205 He sues constantly usually in federal court in Washington D\. C\. to block the progress of biotechnology

4b7c020a The right wing underworld isn\'t always on the side of the landowner as the attacks on the Sumitomo companies suggest 
4b7c020b A year ago Sumitomo Realty received a bomb threat at its Tokyo headquarters and Mr\. Ando the chairman found a cardboard box burning on his doorstep 
4b7c020c This occurred when allegations surfaced linking former Sumitomo executives with a loan scandal involving a land shark company

4b7c020r The United Nations whose garbage bill is forty two thousand dollars a month is served by National Carting Company which won the pickup rights eight years ago 
4b7c020s Last December the U\. N\. didn\'t attempt to solicit bids 
4b7c020t It simply extended its contract with National Carting 
4b7c020u Soliciting bids in this particular industry is not the way to go a U\. N\. spokesman says implying that it is futile 
4b7c020v The impact will be enormous 
4b7c020w The Republicans\' strongest case against the Democratic nominee his naivete on national security issues will disappear 
4b7c020x The suspicion of a selection based entirely on political instead of substantive grounds will be undercut 
4b7c020y And a message that the current vice president is largely irrelevant will be strongly delivered 
4b7c020z The public filings show that a firm called Camro Associates acquired a one \%PERCENT nonvoting stake in Seemala in nineteen eighty four 
4b7c0210 Seemala disclosed the Camro stake in a public s- S\. E\. C\. filing that year Seemala didn\'t identify the investors in Camro

4b7c0212 Even after finding a buyer completing a foreclosure sale is hardly routine 
4b7c0213 Brokers at Merrill Lynch Realty recall a sale that was delayed for a month by a one million dollar Internal Revenue Service lien on the property 
4b7c0214 Another sale was delayed when the lender discovered that the owner had died between the time the property was posted for foreclosure and the foreclosure was completed 
4b7c0215 We were at the closing table when this all came out says Wanda Hutchins the Merrill Lynch agent 
4b7c0216 Invalid foreclosures are one of the biggest problems we have 
4b7c0217 Mr\. Smilow said that the company won\'t have to sell any additional assets to finance a new buy out 
4b7c0218 But it will have a lot more debt than it had previously 
4b7c0219 After the buy out is completed he said Playtex Apparel will have total debt of about three hundred fifty million dollars 
4b7c021a Playtex Holdings\' debt will approach one billion dollars 
4b7c021b Mr\. Giuliani didn\'t return phone calls from this newspaper yesterday 
4b7c021c Mr\. Romano acknowledged that the arrest of the men in February nineteen eighty seven was hasty 
4b7c021d People familiar with the situation say talks between Goldman Sachs and the S\. E\. C\. haven\'t begun yet nor have talks between Mr\. Freeman and the S\. E\. C\. 
4b7c021e And an attorney for the firm Lawrence Pedowitz maintains that Goldman itself was blameless in Mr\. Freeman\'s wrongdoing 
4b7c021f The firm had state of the art compliance policies and procedures in effect at the time of the incident Mr\. Pedowitz says 
4b7c021g I don\'t believe they were in any respect inadequate 
4b7c021h There are obviously some things no compliance department can pick up 
4b7c0301 And the commission is attempting to ensure that the weaker dollar doesn\'t keep Americans away 
4b7c0302 [tongue_click] We\'re trying to urge the entire industry to stabilize prices so that they don\'t fluctuate as much as the dollar says spokesman Neil Martin 
4b7c0303 Even so some prices those for many luxury hotels in Italy and France for example have been soaring 
4b7c0304 In the past Filipinos in many rural areas preferred the disciplined terror of the N\. P\. A\. to the random excesses of the country\'s military 
4b7c0305 With the change of government last year a mild improvement in military behavior and the detection of Mindanao slaughters some Filipinos are changing their minds 
4b7c0306 Diplomats and political analysts say they don\'t know if the trend presages significant popular resistance to the Communists or just additional turmoil in the Philippine countryside 
4b7c0307 The S\. E\. C\. sanctions against the firm and Mr\. Blinder were handed down in December 
4b7c0308 The rulings stem from a nineteen eighty underwriting by Mr\. Blinder and his firm of American Leisure Corp\. a casino company in New York 
4b7c0309 The S\. E\. C\. accused the brokerage of fraud in the deal 
4b7c030a The loan is part of a seventy five million dollar plan to expand the mine\'s reserves and allow it to o- keep operating until nineteen ninety four

4b7c030g Although substantial new taxes are unlikely this year the current debate is important 
4b7c030h Democrats like House Majority Leader James Wright and Majority Whip Tony Coelho believe they can convince Americans that President Reagan has been too kind to the rich 
4b7c030i How that political statement is received by the American people and how it plays in the nineteen eighty eight elections could determine the nature of future tax increases

4b7c030o West Germany is playing for the long term says Pierre Lellouche of the French Institute for Foreign Relations 
4b7c030p It believes it can get East Germany back without falling under Soviet domination itself 
4b7c030q Mr\. Lellouche and most other Frenchmen don\'t think this is possible 
4b7c030r How will the company deal with its debt and operations after the change in leadership 
4b7c030s Mr\. 
4b7c030t Stegemeier is going to have to address that after he becomes chief executive officer the company spokesman said 
4b7c030u It\'s a situation where we are learning our way with the Allante the spokesman said 
4b7c030v The car is doing the things that we want it to do for us as far as getting visibility for the division and being an image car 
4b7c030w Since it\'s been a new entity for Cadillac and our dealers we weren\'t quite sure what the actual sales volume would be 
4b7c030x Agfa Gevaert is a Ridgefield Park New Jersey maker of photographic equipment and supplies that is owned by Bayer A\. G\. of West Germany 
4b7c030y Agfa Gevaert announced last week it would seek to acquire the eighty nine \%PERCENT of Matrix it didn\'t already own for ten dollars a share 
4b7c030z Matrix said at that time that its board reviewed the offer but the results of that review weren\'t announced 
4b7c0310 The advertisement announcing the tender offer says a merger agreement was reached between the two firms last week 
4b7c0311 It doesn\'t appear that cable owners will resist the change 
4b7c0312 A spokesman for the National Cable Television Association said We don\'t oppose the proposal in principle 
4b7c0313 We take the position that the more people in the cable market the better 
4b7c0314 Many people criticize ads that glorify junk 
4b7c0315 Some singled out as contradictory a cooking oil ad telling people how to cut down on cholesterol but featuring fried chicken and french fries 
4b7c0316 It\'s also dishonest some said to omit information or hide it in small print 
4b7c0317 They noted that ads for high fiber cereals neglect to mention their salt and sugar content 
4b7c0318 The Micro Channel is our strategy said Bill Lowe the head of I\. B\. M\.\'s P\. C\. division 
4b7c0319 We\'ve been consistently saying that since April nineteen eighty seven when the P\. S\. two line was introduced 
4b7c031a If we kept changing directions I could see people questioning that 
4b7c031b We give a look like a generation before them lived here says Mr\. Marder 
4b7c031c That\'s worth money 
4b7c031d In the past three years alone the company has doubled its profits and tripled its staff he adds 
4b7c031e Sales are still under twenty million a year he says but they\'re headed up 
4b7c0401 On the Big Board volume rose to two hundred and twenty \.POINT five million shares from hundred and eighty six \.POINT six million Thursday 
4b7c0402 But the activity was less than on previous triple witching days and much of the trading was packed into the opening and closing minutes of the session 
4b7c0403 More than thirty one million shares changed hands in the final minute 
4b7c0404 Several factors contribute to British investors\' regard for these service companies 
4b7c0405 U\. S\. and British accounting standards differ for the good will arising from acquisitions yielding higher reported earnings for British companies 
4b7c0406 Some analysts suggest U\. K\. investors have few high growth industries to choose from and so look favorably on service companies 
4b7c0407 That leaves retail brokerage firms with a stark choice 
4b7c0408 They can move into the institutional t- firms\' turf and fight for a top spot in investment banking 
4b7c0409 Or they can settle into the second rank of the securities business perhaps forever 
4b7c040a Assets of two hundred general purpose funds rose one \.POINT one five billion dollars to seventy \.POINT three six billion 
4b7c040b Assets of ninety three broker dealer funds fell three hundred and sixty one \.POINT seven million dollars to hundred and eight \.POINT oh one billion dollars

4b7c040d The rivals have disputed each other\'s circulation claims for years 
4b7c040e According to recent industry statistics the Post\'s daily circulation is about three hundred and ten thousand the Chronicle\'s approximates four hundred and twenty five thousand 
4b7c040f The Post claims to have roughly forty \%PERCENT of the Houston advertising market 
4b7c040g You didn\'t have people hitting the silks on this said John Keefe an analyst for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc\. New York 
4b7c040h You had to expect higher redemptions given all the difficulty in the market 
4b7c040i But it was contained fairly well 
4b7c040j The purchasing managers sounded more optimistic than most economists in several recent surveys 
4b7c040k Many economists fear the stock market\'s collapse on October nineteen will make shoppers more cautious especially on such major purchases as autos and homes 
4b7c040l Some also fear the stock market\'s woes may persuade companies to postpone capital spending gains until a clear picture of the economy\'s health emerges 
4b7c040m Nevertheless most economists still contend there is no evidence of a recession coming anytime soon 
4b7c040n To punish currency speculators the government is allowing people to exchange a maximum of ten million old cordobas 
4b7c040o Anything over that can\'t be exchanged but must be deposited in a bank account 
4b7c040p The moves took effect yesterday 
4b7c040q Today\'s games rely on computer generated images 
4b7c040r As computer chips have become more powerful the images have become more complicated and vivid but still aren\'t realistic 
4b7c040s Under development however are games in which the players interact with videotape scenes 
4b7c040t The Japanese firms including ourselves have been good members of the primary dealer community said Toshio Mori chairman of Nikko\'s U\. S\. unit 
4b7c040u We are not a disturbing force in this market and I don\'t see any advantage in kicking three Japanese firms out from being primary dealers 
4b7c040v What is the advantage for U\. S\. markets and the U\. S\. economy 
4b7c040w Equicor was launched in nineteen eighty six by Equitable and Hospital Corp\. to provide employee benefit programs and to manage health care products for corporations 
4b7c040x After posting two years of losses it broke even in the first quarter of this year 
4b7c040y Executives of both Equitable and Hospital Corp\. said they expect the venture to be profitable this year 
4b7c040z Estimates of the makeup of the feedlot population vary widely 
4b7c0410 Most analysts expect the government to report that the number of young cattle placed on feedlots fell in July for the second consecutive month from a year earlier 
4b7c0411 However some expect a rise 
4b7c0412 In any case a return to market discipline is inevitable 
4b7c0413 Financial history has witnessed a thousand booms and busts 
4b7c0414 Within recent memory we have seen the junk equities of the sixties the heated Third World lending of the seventies and the thrift crisis of the eighties 
4b7c0415 These problems of the recent past pale in scope next to the pervasiveness and total dollars involved in the current craze 
4b7c0416 If the participants in this craze awaken now the correction may still be within tolerable limits for the country 
4b7c0417 If not all of America will pay the penalty because the debt is huge and widely held and the banking structure\'s integrity would be at stake 
4b7c0418 One stumbling block to increased competition is the vertical integration and cross ownership in the industry 
4b7c0419 Cable systems often have demanded a stake in the channels they transmit 
4b7c041a An entrepreneur is reluctant to start an alternative cable system if he knows that he will find it difficult to gain access to programming 
4b7c041b Quite possibly some of the antitrust aspects of these arrangements deserve a look so it can be determined whether they act to further inhibit competition in the industry 
4b8c0201 Surging stock prices in New York and Tokyo and the prospect of lower world wide interest rates fueled the London rally [door_slam>] dealers said 
4b8c0202 Foreign investment has been heavy 
4b8c0203 It\'s not domestic it\'s overseas a dealer said about the day\'s buying 
4b8c0204 For the time being neither side portrays the outlook as quite that grim 
4b8c0205 Analysts say both Spain and the U\. S\. want to avoid confrontation and point out that Washington appears confident of finding a solution 
4b8c0206 Negotiations will continue at least through November and perhaps beyond [<door_slam] and might well achieve a compromise the analysts say 
4b8c0207 For Kodak a five hundred million dollar penalty would represent about a dollar fifty a share after taxes 
4b8c0208 It might be seen as a victory for Kodak says Alex 
4b8c0209 Brown analyst Otis Bradley in a recent report 
4b8c020a Yesterday Kodak climbed two and three quarter to seventy five and three eighths 
4b8c020b It reported first quarter profit rose to seventy nine cents a share from twenty two cents a share 
4b8c020c Grains and Soybeans Prices were mixed amid resistance to trading in tandem with foreign currencies and metals 
4b8c020d Lack of farmer selling and fears of a hot dry summer boosted soybean futures 
4b8c020e The strength in the soybean contract for delivery after the harvest helped September corn rise slightly as did worries about the summer weather 
4b8c020f [tongue_click] Wheat futures were mixed 
4b8c020g [tongue_click] While other OPEC members recognize the advantage of going downstream most lack Kuwait\'s money small population and ability to move fast

4b8c020j [tongue_click] Here are price trends on the world\'s major stock markets as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective Geneva 
4b8c020k To make them directly comparable each index is based on the close of nineteen sixty nine equaling one hundred 
4b8c020l The percentage change is since year end 
4b8c020m He also relied heavily on advertising rather than on direct mailing which is by far the most common way for newsletters publishers to solicit subscribers 
4b8c020n This unusual strategy evolved from a small ad placed in a business magazine 
4b8c020o The nine hundred and fifty dollar ad generated enough subscriptions to pay for itself in a week so Mr\. Kobren began advertising in other publications

4b8c020t Mr\. Hamm who was here to meet with some of his clients among the OPEC countries said supply and demand in the oil market is balanced 
4b8c020u But he said it\'s balanced at fifteen dollars to sixteen dollars a barrel 
4b8c020v That is two dollars to three dollars a barrel less than the exporters were receiving last year 
4b8c020w If there is a reduction in supply as a result of the joint meetings prices will shoot up Mr\. Hamm said

4b8c0216 One of the four businesses included in the lockup option granted to K\. K\. R\. is Macmillan\'s directory division which consists of Who\'s Who and National Register Publishing 
4b8c0217 Thus it wasn\'t immediately clear why International Thomson might be looking at the operation even though it is included in the lockup option 
4b8c0218 A spokesman for K\. K\. R\. also declined comment 
4b8c0219 Standard and Poor\'s Corporation put this personnel services concern\'s seventy four \.POINT eight million dollars of B\. plus rated convertible subordinated debt on CreditWatch with negative implications 
4b8c021a The move follows the disclosure last week that investment banker Gibbons Green van Amerongen Limited plans a two step acquisition of a substantial stake in Robert Half 
4b8c021b A Robert Half official said the company is convinced that our debt coverage will be strong and we don\'t think the risks will be unreasonable 
4b8c021c And says Mr\. Wagner it works 
4b8c021d I\'m optimistic 
4b8c021e It\'s getting better for gays and lesbians 
4b8c021f If you\'d told me ten years ago I\'d be the chair of the Board of Supervisors today I wouldn\'t have believed you 
4b8c0301 [tongue_click] October\'s contracting for transportation and environmental construction surged thirty seven \%PERCENT to an annual rate of forty four \.POINT three nine billion [loud_breath] following a sharp decline in September 
4b8c0302 The rally in public works construction dominated the month\'s activity 
4b8c0303 Modest gains in home building were offset by a decline in nonresidential construction 
4b8c0304 Under the new Financial Services Act British regulators and their designates can compel testimony from witnesses 
4b8c0305 Overall there appears to be more determination to punish insider trading as the investigation of Mr\. Collier an investment banker at Morgan Grenfell shows 
4b8c0306 To help in the Collier probe the government hastened *implementation* of the insider provisions in the new securities law 
4b8c0307 The spokeswoman declined to identify possible uses for the company\'s cash other than the stock buyback 
4b8c0308 But Gary Schneider analyst with Bear Stearns and Company said he expects the company to extend the buyback beyond four million shares 
4b8c0309 He estimated the company\'s breakup value at seventy dollars a share 
4b8c030a [tongue_click] In nineteen eighty some government employees C\. I\. A\. had to give up First Amendment rights 
4b8c030b Now it is suggested that officials give up Fifth Amendment rights 
4b8c030c In nineteen ninety someone is going to suggest that government officials give up their Fourth Amendment rights protecting them from unlawful searches 
4b8c030d Why not 
4b8c030e They may be hiding important documents in their homes 
4b8c030f [tongue_click] The operating rate is still kind of low but it\'s coming back said Priscilla Luce senior economist at Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates in Philadelphia 
4b8c030g There is some cause for optimism

4b8c030t In the two selected areas the state will allow procurement and retail prices to rise to what the open market demands 
4b8c030u The subsidy for consumers is meant to reduce the strain on urban residents 
4b8c030v Farmers of course will get higher prices for their grain from the market which in turn should induce them to increase production 
4b8c030w Grain production throughout China has faltered in recent years in part because state procurement prices were too low

4b8c0313 To be sure on a lot of scores the summit was a success 
4b8c0314 Economic cooperation was advanced with businessmen signing agreements for about thirty contracts and several joint ventures 
4b8c0315 Human rights too may have taken a step forward if Mr\. Gorbachev lives up to his promise to release all political prisoners by year\'s end 
4b8c0316 [loud_breath] One stumbling block to increased competition is the vertical integration and cross ownership in the industry 
4b8c0317 Cable systems often have demanded a stake in the channels they transmit 
4b8c0318 An entrepreneur is reluctant to start an alternative cable system if he knows that he will find it difficult to gain access to programming 
4b8c0319 Quite possibly some of the antitrust aspects of these arrangements deserve <a> a look so it can be *determined* whether they act to further inhibit competition in the industry 
4b8c031a People close to the situation say the company and pilots\' union were hoping to hammer out an agreement that the other labor groups would find acceptable 
4b8c031b But Mr\. Schroeder\'s letter said the machinists will neither accept a fait accompli nor be stampeded into unnecessary or imprudent action 
4b8c031c He also said the machinists\' union will oppose any transaction that doesn\'t guarantee job protection for its members 
4b8c031d An Upjohn spokeswoman said the company planned to market Rogaine to women all along 
4b8c031e However F\. D\. A\. approval for using the drug on men came first because Upjohn didn\'t test the product on enough women initially 
4b8c031f Upjohn said it began testing Rogaine on women in nineteen eighty seven about four years after tests on balding men began 
4b8c0401 Other planned features of the Osaka airport suggest that the planners haven\'t learned the lessons of Narita 
4b8c0402 The new airport will be constructed on a man made island in Osaka harbor 
4b8c0403 Access will be by a single double decker bridge for cars and trains making the airport vulnerable to civic unrest of the kind that has plagued Narita 
4b8c0404 Commercial banks are seeing this kind of business because some of their lines lending to blue chip corporations for example have dried up 
4b8c0405 Big companies now issue their own paper 
4b8c0406 The old Glass Steagall arguments aimed at limiting risk and dangers that big banks would end up controlling industry look more and more dated 
4b8c0407 Investment banks provide billions in bridge loans for corporate restructurings and takeovers 
4b8c0408 Investment banks seeking more cash will be able to team up with commercial banks without having to look abroad as Goldman Sachs did to find Japan\'s Sumitomo Bank

4b8c040q Two desirable results arise from placing corporate governance decisions as close to the shareholders as possible 
4b8c040r First the decision makers closest to the issue are likely to have the best information with which to make decisions 
4b8c040s Second the opportunity arises for experimentation with different rules of corporate governance

4b8c040x The Science and Technology Agency will spend about one hundred million dollars on superconductivity research over the next five years and the Ministry of Education has its own superconductivity programs 
4b8c040y Tokyo\'s municipal government plans to set up a team to help small businesses apply superconductivity research to products 
4b8c040z Car sales apparently have leveled off after disappointing results early in the year followed by a sharp uptick in late January 
4b8c0410 Bigger incentives fueled the rebound and have helped sustain the sales pace 
4b8c0411 Chrysler Corporation for example boosted cash rebates to twenty five hundred dollars on some models 
4b8c0412 Still Mr\. Love thinks he has the worst behind him 
4b8c0413 Permian has bottomed out he says . but he\'s using Intergroup\'s investment bankers to sound out prospective buyers anyway 
4b8c0414 To bolster the balance sheet he\'s also attempting to reach agreement later this year to sell to Japan\'s N\. K\. K\. the other half of its steel holdings 
4b8c0415 [loud_breath] Since nineteen seventy five the commission has allowed companies based in the convention city to contribute to local host committees raising funds to attract the event 
4b8c0416 Then the F\. E\. C\. allowed donations by national corporations with local outlets

4b8c0418 Possibly the league representatives figure any eighteen year old can fill out a simple form 
4b8c0419 That seems a logical conclusion by any group also capable of presuming all eighteen year olds belong in a voting booth 
4b8c041a Or perhaps they assume I\'ll enthusiastically pick up where they enthusiastically leave off 
4b8c041b N\. B\. C\.\'s T\. V\. coverage also gets its share of the blame 
4b8c041c Marketers say it was so bland and skipped so frequently from one event to another that there was little chance for excitement to build [door_slam] 
4b8c041d The constant commercial interruptions which led to ratings that were much lower than expected didn\'t help either 
4b9c0201 As has been the case in recent quarters the company\'s actual results were masked by several special charges 
4b9c0202 Before a six million loss from discontinued operations Phillips had profit from continuing operations of seventeen million or five cents a share

4b9c020y Later this year Sears plans to open self contained appliance and home shops to compete with Ward 
4b9c020z Sears is also following Ward\'s foray into selling more branded merchandise especially in appliances 
4b9c0210 And it is branching out of malls to open smaller neighborhood stores that could whittle away Ward\'s customer base 
4b9c0211 Oil Change Centers numbered one thousand two hundred and twenty seven franchised units at the end of nineteen eighty six 
4b9c0212 That\'s expected to double by year end with revenue reaching seven hundred and seventy two \.POINT seven million the Commerce Department estimates 
4b9c0213 Jiffy Lube International Incorporated Baltimore is the leader with eight hundred and fifty units but competition is *brewing* as other firms look to expand 
4b9c0214 These include some major oil companies interested in brand awareness 
4b9c0215 Blame it on a local nineteen fifty seven ordinance that bars worldly employment or business except works of necessity and charity on Sunday 
4b9c0216 Recreation related businesses such as movie theaters and bowling alleys also are exempt 
4b9c0217 The purpose of the ban is to keep down traffic the town says 
4b9c0218 When the Federal Reserve earlier this month raised the discount rate it didn\'t increase its popularity 
4b9c0219 G\. O\. P\. politicians publicly damned the move with faint praise and privately worried that the Fed was creating a recession that would wipe out George Bush 
4b9c021a Democrat Michael Dukakis was a little uncomfortable but allowed as how he could see the need for the move 
4b9c021b In the position I\'m in I could raise a whole lot of money in ten days more than I would need he says 
4b9c021c But I won\'t do it 
4b9c021d I would be defeated before I would accept campaign contributions 
4b9c021e Ever since he took office three and a half years ago Mr\. Gorbachev has sought to increase foreign trade\'s meager share of the Soviet economy 
4b9c021f Rather than simply import more Western goods he would like to obtain the machinery and know how to enable the Soviets to make the goods themselves 
4b9c021g To do so he opened up the economy to foreign capital and equipment by permitting joint ventures 
4b9c0301 The S\. E\. C\. says its rule prohibits shareholders who participate in a tender offer from making additional profits by simultaneously selling short other stock in the company 
4b9c0302 In a short sale a holder sells borrowed stock that he agrees to replace later 
4b9c0303 In effect the holder is betting that the price of the company\'s stock will drop allowing him to profit by replacing the stock with cheaper stock 
4b9c0304 What if anything will come of all of this in nineteen eighty seven remains to be seen of course 
4b9c0305 The year also may yield answers to some other questions currently puzzling investors Will the economy finally get moving again 
4b9c0306 And if it does will renewed inflation be all but inevitable 
4b9c0307 Will the political realignment in Congress help or hurt efforts to whittle the nation\'s huge trade and budget deficits 
4b9c0308 Du Pont rose four and a quarter to one hundred and eleven and three quarters 
4b9c0309 The company which owns Conoco said it knew of no specific reason for the price gain 
4b9c030a But it noted that the stock seems to be trading as an oil issue 
4b9c030b U\. S\. X\. which owns Marathon Oil rose five eighths to twenty six and five eighths on more than two \.POINT two million shares 
4b9c030c There is no denying that a program of routine testing and contact notification presents some challenges 
4b9c030d Few decisions on AIDS are easy 
4b9c030e But the difficulty of the task cannot discourage us from facing up to our responsibilities 
4b9c030f For what is the alternative 
4b9c030g To go on as we have been 
4b9c030h We cannot do that 
4b9c030i We assume there may be other companies with this kind of problem Mr\. Nagata said 
4b9c030j Other finance professionals however played down the extent of such problems 
4b9c030k One analyst said the scope of Tateho\'s problems is ridiculous 
4b9c030l Most companies are more conservative 
4b9c030m The Philip Morris magazine enjoys by far the highest circulation of any company magazine seven \.POINT two million copies 
4b9c030n The only requirement is that you have to be an adult to receive the magazine says Mary Taylor associate publisher 
4b9c030o That\'s not because of racy articles but because the tobacco industry has been accused of trying to snatch twelve and thirteen year olds 
4b9c030p Philip Morris is even considering selling space to outside advertisers it already ran an ad for Time magazine on a test basis in its winter nineteen eighty seven issue 
4b9c030q Representative Gephardt is at age forty six the embodiment of the cool post Watergate politician 
4b9c030r His hair never seems ruffled his tie would no doubt hang straight down in a typhoon

4b9c030t The phrase Winter Olympics is the only item protected by a trademark that is mentioned in the suit 
4b9c030u It is among more than two hundred words phrases and symbols for which the association has gained trademark protection in Canada 
4b9c030v A spokesman for the U\. S\. Olympic Committee said most such words and symbols are similarly protected in the U\. S\. 
4b9c030w Correspondent banking or providing services to smaller banks is one area that Manufacturers might leave 
4b9c030x The profitability of that business has been declining for years Mr\. Wooden said 
4b9c030y It was through these correspondent banks that Manufacturers got all of these energy loans that have soured 
4b9c030z However one Manufacturers executive said he doubted correspondent banking would be eliminated in light of that business\'s improved performance recently 
4b9c0310 Mr\. Reichler recently stunned some liberals when he agreed to represent the Guatemalan government in its quest to win U\. S\. aid for its police force and military 
4b9c0311 Some human rights groups strongly opposed the request citing Guatemalan authorities\' history of abuses 
4b9c0312 Mr\. Reichler launched a lobbying blitz among U\. S\. liberals arguing that the aid would help stem violations 
4b9c0313 The police got two million for training and Guatemala also got seven million in military assistance 
4b9c0314 The measure was a bold move for a president who has come to view inertia as the best form of security 
4b9c0315 The suspension effectively will slash salaries and cut an estimated eight \.POINT three billion from federal spending this year 
4b9c0316 The aim is to hold the budget deficit to four \.POINT nine \%PERCENT of economic output down from a projected seven \%PERCENT 
4b9c0317 This it is hoped will help stop high inflation from spiraling into hyperinflation 
4b9c0318 In Taipei there were newspaper reports that the Ministry of Finance turned down a proposal to allow business banks to set up branches in other cities 
4b9c0319 Trading volume hit a record at five hundred and twenty four million shares compared with four hundred and forty nine million shares in the previous session 
4b9c031a Traders said banking issues led the market lower in response to the reports 
4b9c031b Unconvinced the Harrisburg City Council in April passed an ordinance requiring local employers with ten or more employees to give up twelve weeks of unpaid parental leave 
4b9c031c Harrisburg is believed to be the first U\. S\. city to pass such a statute and it is much stricter than any state legislation 
4b9c031d For instance Wisconsin passed a parental leave law in April which provides for only six weeks of unpaid leave and exempts companies with fewer than fifty employees 
4b9c0401 The new service differs from the shuttle in several ways 
4b9c0402 It won\'t have the backup planes that the shuttle uses to accommodate passenger overflow 
4b9c0403 The new flights will include advance seat selection and first class and coach service which the shuttle doesn\'t 
4b9c0404 Shuttle flights depart on the hour the new service will operate on the half hour 
4b9c0405 The law even comes with its own Catch twenty two 
4b9c0406 You\'ll never again be able to fill out your own tax return Roger tells me 
4b9c0407 But the law also says you probably no longer can deduct the cost of hiring professional help 
4b9c0408 Cable operators are willing participants in the price cutting programs 
4b9c0409 For one thing because of deregulation which took effect January first the operators have been allowed to raise rates for basic cable service 
4b9c040a In addition the pay networks are cutting the prices they charge operators 
4b9c040b That may signal that equity linked Eurobonds aren\'t going to disappear even if equities fall out of investor favor 
4b9c040c Difficult markets won\'t end the game says a syndication official for one large U\. S\. investment house

4b9c040h With less regulatory and political pressure Conrail was able to abandon about five thousand miles of track between nineteen eighty one and nineteen eighty six 
4b9c040i About half of that has been taken up by short line railroads nonunion railroads that have continued to provide the service at a lesser cost 
4b9c040j They bring the business to us and we handle it as a trunk line 
4b9c040k Mr\. Bergeron and Investcorp say they have ambitious medium term plans for Chaumet 
4b9c040l Long restricted to the high end of the market Chaumet may move into middle range jewelry 
4b9c040m Following a trend in the luxury goods business it could also diversify into watches and other accessories or into the perfume business 
4b9c040n Investcorp executives also say that Chaumet aims to expand geographically particularly in the U\. S\. where it already has a shop in New York and in Asia 
4b9c040o Pratt and Whitney said last week it might lay off employees after the first of the year because of decreased demand for jet engines and parts 
4b9c040p The company declined to discuss how many employees might be laid off or if the loss would be permanent or temporary 
4b9c040q But union officials said the company has tossed around numbers from sixteen hundred to two thousand

4b9c040s Intel the biggest O\. T\. C\. semiconductor maker and by far the largest electronics issue on Nasdaq fell one quarter to twenty three and three quarters 
4b9c040t L\. S\. I\. Logic another big semiconductor concern with some P\. C\. making customers was unchanged at seven and three quarters 
4b9c040u But a raft of smaller electronics issues helped push the Nasdaq electronics group\'s average up more than one \%PERCENT 
4b9c040v But Jay Chiat chairman of Chiat Day isn\'t worried 
4b9c040w We started with the umbrella positioning of the corporate name and we\'re moving into specific product areas he says 
4b9c040x We\'re not changing because of any sales situation 
4b9c040y Mr\. Mignanelli meanwhile says he is backing Chiat one hundred \%PERCENT and believes that more people now recognize the Nissan name 
4b9c040z The plan was carefully constructed to conform with the conservative gradualist principles of the existing Baker plan devised by former secretary Baker 
4b9c0410 That approach features a menu of options by which banks and debtor countries might voluntarily negotiate new loans or reductions in debt 
4b9c0411 The plan opposes government assumption of bank risk or bailouts and stresses new lending over debt relief 
4b9c0412 The gangs are even becoming adept at their own sort of public relations- ~ 
4b9c0413 They buy food for the elderly and sneakers for kids making wary *allies* of both

4b9c0415 South Africa Angola and Cuba ended a round of peace talks without an agreement or a date to meet again 
4b9c0416 But sources said the discussions which involve Namibian independence and peace in Angola have made progress 
4b9c0417 Apparently the three nations are focusing on a U\. S\. proposal that would get Cuban troops out of Angola in two years 
4b9c0418 N\. B\. C\.\'s T\. V\. coverage also gets its share of the blame 
4b9c0419 Marketers say it was so bland and skipped so frequently from one event to another that there was little chance of excitement to build 
4b9c041a The constant commercial interruptions which led to ratings that were much lower than expected didn\'t help either 
4b9c041b If Texaco managers want to be there in the future it would make sense to boost the stock says an influential Texaco holder 
4b9c041c Otherwise he says When their election comes around you could get a big swing in the vote if Mr\. Icahn decides to renew the fight 
4b9c041d Of course there is no way Texaco can guarantee its independence if it gets a takeover bid

4bac020s The Depression wasn\'t just one long slump as the popular image has it but a series of *recoveries* aborted by further recessions

4bbc020a Second the opportunity arises for experimentation with different rules of corporate governance 
4bbc020b Mr\. Trump wasn\'t available for comment yesterday 
4bbc020c Industry sources have disputed his claim that he holds that large a Golden Nugget stake as well as any takeover threat

4bbc020e He wasn\'t available for comment yesterday 
4bbc020f What\'s more a further drop in the dollar could have the very result Mr\. Baker seeks to avoid higher interest rates 
4bbc020g In order to keep persuading foreign investors to hold cheaper dollars the Federal Reserve must keep U\. S\. interest rates higher than those abroad 
4bbc020h An even weaker dollar could require higher rates 
4bbc020i Certainly government controlled television has had a role in that transformation 
4bbc020j Mr\. Roh\'s strategists say Koreans have ten times more television sets some ten million than in the last presidential elections in nineteen seventy one 
4bbc020k Thus a recent Kim Young Sam rally that attracted a crowd of one million at his home town of Pusan was a secondary news item on the nightly news

4bbc020y Checkout counters are primary impulse buying situations says Willard Bishop a food retailing consultant 
4bbc020z And there\'s tremendous competition for attention not only from other magazines but from items like candy tobacco and razor blades Mr\. Bishop adds 
4bbc0210 That\'s why magazine executives say covers have to reach out and grab buyers 
4bbc0211 Federal officials are particularly pleased with the dollar\'s new found strength 
4bbc0212 They see it as a vote of confidence in their conduct of monetary policy it reduces the threat of inflation and eases pressure for further interest rate increases 
4bbc0213 Economist David Hale says the dollar\'s strength is dimming the prospect of an eighty nine recession as well as an eighty eight financial crisis 
4bbc0214 I just wanted to take a minute to thank you for running Alexander Cockburn\'s Viewpoint column 
4bbc0215 His columns often provide a fresh slant on the major issues of the day

4bbc0217 Frankfurt share prices closed mostly lower in moderately active trading Friday as an early rally fizzled amid position squaring before the weekend and uncertainty about the lower dollar 
4bbc0218 The DAX index dropped five \.POINT four nine to twelve hundred and eighty nine \.POINT seven two 
4bbc0219 After opening broadly higher the tide turned at midday when the dollar\'s slide to a three month low began to worry market participants 
4bbc021a The dollar was confined to fairly narrow ranges in Asian and early European trading as market participants concentrated on mark yen trading 
4bbc021b The German currency traded in a range between seventy three \.POINT three yen and seventy three \.POINT six five yen through most of New York trading 
4bbc021c At the New York finish the mark was unchanged at seventy three \.POINT four six yen

4bbc0304 Banks weren\'t the only ones *excluded* from the private talks 
4bbc0305 Stephen D\. Susman one of the Hunts\' lead attorneys said he didn\'t know about the discussions until he started hearing the other banks\' objections 
4bbc0306 But Mr\. Susman said he isn\'t troubled by the meetings 
4bbc0307 It seems like good sense to me 
4bbc0308 Intelligent people in litigation ought to be talking to people to try to resolve it he said 
4bbc0309 The banks sought to eliminate a mismatch between their assets predominantly held in non pound currencies and their capital kept in pounds 
4bbc030a When the pound was weak during the early nineteen eighties the value of Scandinavian Bank\'s capital fell steeply in proportion to its non dollar assets 
4bbc030b The banks that owned Scandinavian Bank had to inject about forty seven \.POINT seven million dollars of additional capital 
4bbc030c The altered memo however never mentioned the president

4bbc0314 In the event this danger was averted 
4bbc0315 After recovering part of its loss in the first few days after October nineteenth the market sputtered out the year with a persisting sense of crisis 
4bbc0316 In the first week of January the world central banks intervened massively to support the dollar and backed up the interventions with adjustments in basic monetary policy 
4bbc0317 The Treasury Bundesbank rift was obviously resolved and international cooperation restored 
4bbc0318 The sense of crisis dissipated and the market started the gradual climb to its current levels

4bbc031d Jeffrey Levine is on leave from the board 
4bbc031e Neither has been charged with any crime 
4bbc0401 This variability in fit has also been evident in the mergers of other Southeastern banking companies 
4bbc0402 Each banking company you mentioned has moved to place its executives in key policy jobs in order to effect the transfer of culture policy and procedures to acquired banks 
4bbc0403 In each case there have been significant departures of officers of the merged banks extending to former C\. E\. O\.s in some instances 
4bbc0404 Border skirmishes are periodic 
4bbc0405 The two countries are engaged in a conventional arms race that has dragged in the U\. S\. and the Soviet Union 
4bbc0406 India and Pakistan also fear the other\'s nuclear policies 
4bbc0407 The U\. S\. Congress is considering a four \.POINT oh two billion dollar defense and economic aid package for Pakistan 
4bbc0408 The Soviet Union has assured New Delhi that any conventional weapon in its arsenal is available to India 
4bbc0409 For investors the partnerships are only as attractive as the underlying buyouts 
4bbc040a Many in the field contend that the buyouts being put together these days are generally overpriced because of several factors 
4bbc040b Among them too much capital chasing too few good candidates which has pushed costs up and returns down to what they see as unacceptable levels 
4bbc040c So home equity loans seem almost sure to be a significant factor in consumer borrowing for some years to come 
4bbc040d The pace of lending may slow as consumers complete the process of substituting one form of borrowing for another 
4bbc040e And who knows consumers may finally get a little more conservative in their borrowing 
4bbc040f The directors didn\'t indicate what the dividend rate will be on the split shares

4bbc040v The shocker was that the judge had ordered a huge damage payment before Carbide\'s liability for damages if any had been established at a trial 
4bbc040w At first glance at least the decision seems to violate any defendant\'s fundamental right to present evidence and to cross examine witnesses against it 
4bbc040x A Carbide spokesman has decried the ruling as a judgment and a decree without trial 
4bbc040y The king\'s request left the delegates in a tight spot 
4bbc040z To ignore Jordan and make a substantial formal cash pledge to the P\. L\. O\. would signal a shift away from moderation difficult for the gulf states to countenance

4bcc0201 In addition to the war of nerves over discounts retail executives said this Christmas season has been characterized by the absence of a big hit in the toy department 
4bcc0202 But retailers have seen strong sales of big ticket items to well heeled customers 
4bcc0203 They are buying to beat the new tax law which will end the deduction of sales taxes and some interest expenses 
4bcc0204 The spokeswoman declined to identify possible uses for the company\'s cash other than the stock buyback 
4bcc0205 But Gary Schneider analyst with Bear Stearns and Co\. said he expects the company to extend the buyback beyond four million shares 
4bcc0206 He estimated the company\'s breakup value at seventy dollars a share 
4bcc0207 The administration has occasionally mouthed complaints about the Private Express Statutes the laws that prohibit free choice in mail service but has done little aside from talk 
4bcc0208 The White House intervened earlier last year to stop the Postal Service from banning private companies from shipping bundles of letters overseas to be deposited directly in foreign mail systems 
4bcc0209 But this was fairly minor 
4bcc020a PaineWebber itself hasn\'t been charged with wrongdoing 
4bcc020b The firm a unit of PaineWebber Group Inc\. released a short statement yesterday in which it said the two men have been suspended indefinitely

4bcc020d Livestock and meats Increased demand from retailers and meatpackers boosted cattle future prices 
4bcc020e The December contract rose one \.POINT oh seven cents a pound to sixty eight \.POINT six two cents at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange 
4bcc020f However analysts don\'t expect the rise in prices which began late last week to be sustained once retailers and packers meet their needs 
4bcc020g It is doubtful beef will support this price after this week said Jerry Abbenhaus an analyst at A\. G\. Edwards and Sons Inc\. in Saint Louis 
4bcc020h Hog futures were mixed as lower cash prices and a fairly large delivery of animals to slaughter weighed against the December contract 
4bcc020i Pork belly prices fell

4bcc031a Further signs of strong U\. S\. economic growth are expected to emerge from a Labor Department report next Friday on the nation\'s employment picture for August 
4bcc031b [tongue_click] If so Federal Reserve officials may raise short term interest rates further within a few weeks several analysts said 
4bcc031c They also predicted that banks will raise their prime or base rates again to ten and a half \%PERCENT or eleven \%PERCENT from the current ten \%PERCENT level 
4bcc0401 As a result many insurance issues are down ten \%PERCENT to twenty five \%PERCENT from their highs reached mostly last spring 
4bcc0402 The bulls argue however that sellers are leaving the party too soon 
4bcc0403 For one thing they say the large premium increases of the past few years have only begun to appear in insurers\' bottom lines 
4bcc0404 For nineteen eighty seven earnings gains of twenty five \%PERCENT to more than fifty \%PERCENT from nineteen eighty six levels are almost a certainty at these companies 
4bcc0405 And most analysts expect the earnings growth to continue albeit at a more modest rate . in nineteen eighty eight 
4bcc0406 Macho nonsense of this type about world trade in the nation\'s highest deliberative body helps explain why confidence in the U\. S\. dollar has not been rock solid of late 
4bcc0407 A White House game of chicken with Germany and Japan played by talking down the dollar hasn\'t helped either

4bdc0312 While former executive branch officials face jail for non crimes Congress is abusing the judicial process in seeking immunity from libel suits 
4bdc0313 The U\. S\. Court of Appeals for the D\. C\. Circuit held last November that congressmen can be sued for statements made outside Congress

4bdc0402 One New York trader said he witnessed the currency\'s value jump as his bank executed a purchase order for two hundred and fifty million dollars in several chunks 
4bdc0403 When there are very few players that kind of order will move the market said the trader who asked not to be identified 
4bdc0404 The biggest danger economists said is a free fall of the dollar 
4bdc0405 That would force the U\. S\. to raise interest rates to attract the foreign capital needed to finance its current account deficit and indirectly its budget deficit 
4bdc0406 Higher rates in turn could plunge the U\. S\. and possibly the world into a recession that could threaten the international financial system 
4bdc0407 The review committee tries to offer a menu of small medium and large capitalization stocks

4bdc040a S:ome experts say that because of sweeping technological changes the telecommunications industry couldn\'t be re regulated even if people wanted

4bdc040c While rules are revived to deal with publicized concerns such as air and rail safety the government pullback continues in such areas as consumer protection and antitrust enforcement 
4bdc040d Two desirable results arise from placing corporate governance decisions as close to the shareholders as possible 
4bdc040e First the decision makers closest to the issue are likely to have the best information with which to make decisions

4bdc040h Congress now turns to its rewrite of the Gramm Rudman law which has targeted the fiscal nineteen eighty eight deficit at a hundred and eight billion dollars 
4bdc040i The target will be raised because members it seems are not prepared to keep the spending cut promises made when it was set 
4bdc040j Nevertheless some analysts say the Fed already may be tightening credit slightly 
4bdc040k They point to the recent increases in the federal funds rate which is the rate on reserves that banks lend each other overnight 
4bdc040l The funds rate averaged about seven and five eighths \%PERCENT yesterday and Tuesday up from an average of seven \.POINT three four \%PERCENT in the week ended October seventh 
4bdc040m These analysts argue that the *increase* was engineered by the Fed

4bdc040w A merger with Macy which is roughly half the size of Federated could be attractive to the larger retailer\'s executives 
4bdc040x Macy\'s smaller size could leave Federated\'s officers with operating power in a combined concern

4bec020w Chairman Greenspan inherited from his predecessor Paul Volcker a monetary policy that had been quite erratic 
4bec020x The Fed allowed the money supply to grow very rapidly through nineteen eighty six 
4bec020y Then in nineteen eighty seven the central bank tightened up sharply 
4bec020z For the first few months of this year I thought policy might be all right says Milton Friedman of the Hoover Institution 
4bec0210 You could say that it was offsetting the *excessively* easy policy of nineteen eighty six 
4bec0211 But the restraint continued and in early October before the market crash Mr\. Friedman predicted a recession would start in six to nine months

4bec0217 Funds heavily invested in U\. S\. and Swiss bonds yielded the quarter\'s poorest returns 
4bec0218 But the ride could be bumpy 
4bec0219 South Korean political unrest could curb market gains for one thing 
4bec021a Any severe slump in U\. S\. market could drag down the Korea Fund too 
4bec021b Currency losses also could eat into returns though *economists* expect the South Korean won will rise in value against the U\. S\. dollar

4bfc0214 There are too many cases where customs officers have given their opinion the classification of goods off the top of their heads

4bfc0304 Brooks itself borrowed money to fund the thirty million cash portion 
4bfc0305 But while Eureka projects are more easily approved the vagueness of the funding is one reason many European companies have been skeptical about the program\'s value 
4bfc0306 Another is its loose organization with no central system yet established for checking on the progress of individual projects 
4bfc0307 Most of the projects adopted over the past year haven\'t gotten off the drawing board 
4bfc0308 Bally\'s drive into the hotel casino industry has made health clubs an inc:reasingly awkward fit analysts said and thus the most likely candidate for divestiture 
4bfc0309 By shedding the health club line Bally could focus on its remaining operations gambling machines state lotteries and amusement centers 
4bfc030a Analysts also question the fit of the company\'s theme parks though saying a sale of that operation could follow

4bfc030w They point to recent increases in the federal funds rate which is the rate on reserves that banks lend each other overnight 
4bfc030x The funds rate averaged about seven and five eighths \%PERCENT yesterday and Tuesday up from an average of seven \.POINT four three \%PERCENT in the week ended October seventh

4bfc030z Tax talk by James Baker and Howard Baker riles administration conservatives 
4bfc0310 [tongue_click] If the president signs off on significant taxes there\'ll be a lot of screaming and shouting says a White House aide 
4bfc0311 But despite the rhetoric any tax bill accepted by the White House is likely to do little to reduce the red ink 
4bfc0312 [loud_breath] Several new taxes proposed by the House on takeovers also appear doomed 
4bfc0313 But others notably Wells Fargo Investment Advisers pressed on 
4bfc0314 We felt that the futures market reflected actual trading levels at the time says Fred Grauer the head of the Wells Fargo and Company subsidiary 
4bfc0315 Many stock prices hadn\'t been updated in several minutes he explains and it was likely that subsequent stock trades would be at even lower levels 
4bfc0316 By day\'s end Wells sold fourteen thousand future contracts amounting to nearly two billion dollars

4bfc0318 Later he says when the Russians liberated Smolensk a new commission found German bullets in the skulls of the officers 
4bfc0319 And the method by which they where shot in the backs of the heads was a German method

4bfc031c And that is everything I know 
4bfc0401 Stan Weinstein the editor of the Professional Tape Reader which also ranked near the bottom in the survey disagrees with several assumptions in Mr\. Hulbert\'s ranking method 
4bfc0402 For example Mr\. Weinstein dislikes the way Mr\. Hulbert calculates entry and exit prices 
4bfc0403 He says Mr\. Hulbert should use prices midway in Mr\. Weinstein\'s recommended ranges for stock purchases or sales 
4bfc0404 Mr\. Hulbert customarily uses market prices either the opening price or the average price for the day shortly after the recommendation was made

4bfc041e When the Federal Reserve earlier this month raised the discount rate it didn\'t increase its popularity 
4bfc041f G\. O\. P\. politicians publicly damned the move with faint praise and privately worried that the Fed was creating a recession that would wipe out George Bush

4bgc0213 [loud_breath] At first the rebels tried to struggle along with their home grown mules 
4bgc0214 But these animals were a scrawny lot by American standards and when they weren\'t worked to death they were gunned down by the Soviets 
4bgc0215 The Turks were nearby but they also had inferior mules 
4bgc0216 The Chinese charged outlandish rates fully twenty five hundred dollars a mule 
4bgc0217 The Egyptians were quickly drained of their supply

4bgc0301 Closed circuit television is the pot at the end of the rainbow for boxing\'s biggest fights

4bgc0303 Meanwhile young heavyweight sensation Mike Tyson promises to generate closed circuit quality fights for years to come 
4bgc0304 [loud_breath] He also relied heavily on advertising rather than on direct mailing which is by far the most common way for newsletter publishers to solicit subscribers 
4bgc0305 This unusual strategy evolved from a small ad placed in a business magazine 
4bgc0306 The nine hundred and fifty dollar ad generated enough subscriptions to pay for itself in a week so Mr\. Kobren began advertising in other publications 
4bgc0307 Of his company\'s one million in operating expenses last year fully half went for marketing

4bgc0311 The study was part of Cornell\'s response to calls by local politicians that it should help more in Tompkins County 
4bgc0312 When the schools were ranked by operating budget or value of buildings Cornell\'s one \.POINT two million dollar payments were found to be near the bottom of the list 
4bgc0313 In per student payments Cornell ranked seventh at seventy dollars 
4bgc0314 But freedom isn\'t an accident 
4bgc0315 It is the result of painstaking work to maintain the structure of liberty against inevitable erosion at the hands of the government 
4bgc0316 [loud_breath] I thought that my work for the A\. C\. L\. U\. was an integral part of maintaining freedom for everyone 
4bgc0317 I now confess my error and embrace Leader Bush\'s perception that the A\. C\. L\. U\. is a politically suspect liberal conspiracy 
4bgc0318 In my ministry we have discussed the alternatives of independence 
4bgc0319 There are already two Germanys and two Koreas 
4bgc031a But after close study we concluded that independence is a dead end 
4bgc031b Who would recognize us 
4bgc031c And in that case what\'s the use of declaring independence 
4bgc031d Then in June came a case involving college students who attempted to throw a Tupperware party at the State University of New York 
4bgc031e They were forbidden by university officials who cited rules prohibiting commercial enterprises on campus 
4bgc031f The students sued the school but the Supreme Court held in favor of the university ban 
4bgc0401 The Bundesbank has refused any further action 
4bgc0402 These days it\'s possible to pick up the papers and read about West German fears of reigniting inflation 
4bgc0403 You have to pinch yourself to remember that the inflation running near zero in April is now running below zero 
4bgc0404 The E\. M\. S\. apparently must now be realigned and the franc devalued to accommodate the German taste for deflation 
4bgc0405 That hardly matters says Sir Geoffrey noting that with all the traitor spies that preceded him there wasn\'t much left to tell 
4bgc0406 The point is he was one of us

4bgc040b One possible goal a regional consortium to help prop up land prices 
4bgc040c The company attributed the earnings increase to growing popularity of its three plus network operating system [loud_breath] which is used with International Business Machines Corporation\'s personal computers and compatible models 
4bgc040d The company also said initial orders for its three plus network operating system for Apple Computer Incorporated\'s Macintosh have been extremely encouraging 
4bgc040e The system for the Macintosh was introduced in August 
4bgc040f The Supreme Court turned its back on the basic wisdom of the Commerce Clause last April [loud_breath] in the case of C\. T\. S\. Corporation versus 
4bgc040g Dynamics Corporation 
4bgc040h This was the case that upheld Indiana\'s law regulating corporate takeovers which went much further than federal law to protect targets at the expense of bidders 
4bgc040i The result is a crush of anti takeover laws in a dozen states so far 
4bgc040j The administration opposes the bill and no similar legislation has been introduced in the Senate 
4bgc040k The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee\'s subcommittee on civil service will hold hearings on the measure late this year or early in nineteen eighty eight a spokesman said

4bgc040m Northgate declined to estimate the size of an expected gain on the sale 
4bgc040n The company said net proceeds of about a hundred and thirty million dollars will be mainly used to finance gold mining acquisitions 
4bgc040o Northgate said it will seek pure gold mines only 
4bgc040p Ocean Spray says it simply can\'t sell pure cranberry juice because it\'s too tart tasting 
4bgc040q So why not explain that fact on the label 
4bgc040r Consumers would automatically assume our product is less nutritious than pure orange or apple juice a spokesman says

4bgc040t Macy is offering seventy seven dollars and thirty cents a share for eighty \%PERCENT of Federated\'s shares plus stock in a combined Federated Macy for the remainder 
4bgc040u The stock component makes it difficult to determine the value of the total bid [loud_breath] which has been widely estimated at about six \.POINT three billion dollars

4bgc0414 No one collects baskets or displays them 
4bgc0415 Baskets are simply used and used until they wear out 
4bgc0416 The seeds of NatWest\'s investment banking problems were sown months before the deregulation of Britain\'s financial markets 
4bgc0417 Rivals such as Barclays and S\. G\. Warburg Group P\. L\. C\. assembled powerhouse conglomerates of brokerage trading and fixed income securities firms 
4bgc0418 But NatWest then pushing to dislodge Barclays as Britain\'s top commercial bank was more reluctant to commit itself to a similar position in investment banking 
4bgc0419 The suit charges that Burger King [<door_slam] only allows black franchises to expand one store at a time while whites are allowed to simultaneously open multiple franchises 
4bgc041a Burger King also makes blacks wait [door_slam>] three to four times longer than whites for approval of a new or expansion franchise the suit says 
4bgc041b The franchises further allege that Burger King falsely and fraudulently misrepresented the sales potential of their stores 
4bgc041c Mr\. Greenspan complied 
4bgc041d What happened there is very similar to what I gather is happening here he said 
4bgc041e Just when the Social Security panel was about to give up the dam broke which led us to a rather surprising end 
4bhc0201 [tongue_click] Commercial banks are seeking this kind of business because some of their lines [door_slam>] lending to blue chip corporations for example have dried up 
4bhc0202 Big companies now issue their own paper 
4bhc0203 The old Glass Steagall arguments aimed at limiting risk and dangers that big banks would end up controlling industry look more and more dated 
4bhc0204 Investment banks provide billions in bridge loans for corporate restructurings and takeovers 
4bhc0205 Investment banks seeking more cash will be able to team up with commercial banks without having to look abroad as Goldman Sachs did to find Japan\'s Sumitomo Bank 
4bhc0206 [tongue_click] That line may be wearing thin with private banks 
4bhc0207 They would like to see more evidence of sound policy moves 
4bhc0208 Otherwise why keep pouring good money after bad 
4bhc0209 [loud_breath] In the February twenty second accord the U\. S\. and its allies asserted that the dollar had declined enough 
4bhc020a [loud_breath] They pledged to intervene jointly in the foreign exchange markets to keep exchange rates at about their current levels 
4bhc020b The dollar remained stable for about four weeks after the accord was reached but then began to slump against the Japanese yen 
4bhc020c Central banks intervened and eventually helped arrest the slide 
4bhc020d [tongue_click] Mr\. Trump had characterized his purchases of U\. A\. L\. stock as an investment in a company with undervalued assets 
4bhc020e He has spoken out frequently against U\. A\. L\. management in recent weeks 
4bhc020f [loud_breath] He has called U\. A\. L\.\'s plan to change its name to Allegis Corporation a waste of money and that Allegis sounds like some new disease 
4bhc020g The recapitalization was proposed to thwart a takeover effort by British Printing and Communication Corporation 
4bhc020h [tongue_click] The Oxford England publishing and printing concern controlled by Robert Maxwell filed suit in federal court in New York this week to block the recapitalization 
4bhc020i A court victory would pave the way for Mr\. Maxwell to make a new offer for Harcourt

4bhc020z Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value 
4bhc0210 Thus higher bidding narrows the investor\'s return while lower bidding widens it 
4bhc0211 The percentage rates are calculated on a three hundred and sixty day year while the coupon equivalent yield is based on a three hundred and sixty five day year 
4bhc0212 [lip_smack] That same organization has remained in place ever since

4bhc0214 They have their own newsletter 
4bhc0215 It has become a kind of private club which Dole supporters say is basically elitist 
4bhc0216 Some wonder whether all the conversions don\'t make Mr\. Beregovoy more of an opportunist than a believer in the market economy 
4bhc0217 [tongue_click] But his aides say he was convinced that he was doing the right thing 
4bhc0218 [loud_breath] Mr\. Beregovoy said I\'m not ashamed of what I do 
4bhc0219 [tongue_click] The company said the results indicate its efforts to improve sales are beginning to pay off

4bhc021b In February it launched radio advertisements featuring comedian Martin Mull and in April it unveiled a new menu 
4bhc021c People close to the situation say the company and pilots\' union were hoping to hammer out an agreement that the other labor groups would find acceptable 
4bhc021d But Mr\. Schroeder\'s letter said the machinists will neither accept a fait accompli nor be stampeded into unnecessary or imprudent action 
4bhc021e [tongue_click] He also said the machinists\' union will oppose any transaction that doesn\'t guarantee job protection for its members 
4bhc0301 [tongue_click] Speculation heats up on Volcker\'s future 
4bhc0302 [tongue_click] Some believe his odds of being reappointed this summer are enhanced by the weakened position of the White House Chief of Staff Regan who wants Volcker out 
4bhc0303 [tongue_click] Yet many insiders doubt that Volcker who is resisting the administration on regulatory matters will be kept barring a financial crisis 
4bhc0304 However one source close to the companies said he wouldn\'t rule out the possibility of Limited buying I\. Magnin

4bhc031a [tongue_click] Recent coverage of the closing of Long Island Lighting Company\'s nuclear power plant brings to light a fascinating irony 
4bhc031b [tongue_click] The victory celebration of those who opposed the plant may be short lived 
4bhc031c Without this plant Long Island stands a very good chance of major shortages in electrical supplies during its ever increasing peak demand periods 
4bhc031d [loud_breath] This lack of reliability will be a signal to business and industry that Long Island is not a desirable place to locate 
4bhc031e Meanwhile local state and national taxpayers will be joining Lilco ratepayers in footing the bill for the unused facility 
4bhc031f These same ratepayers will be forced to pay top market price for electricity imported into their system

4bhc0408 [loud_breath] It might be said by way of rejoinder that congressional liberals will blithely enact all proposed social policies that are popular and then cut the military budget drastically 
4bhc0409 This is possible but unlikely 
4bhc040a [tongue_click] It is a lot easier to form a congressional majority against drastic cuts in defense than against relatively modest expenditures on particular social programs

4bhc040y Commission regulations prohibit the sale of pacifiers with strings and require a label warning against this practice 
4bhc040z [loud_breath] Any further effort to reduce the hazards associated with pacifiers would divert attention and resources from greater dangers and the warnings probably would cause needless worry

4bhc0413 Another condition is that the Topeka Group a unit of Duluth Minnesota based Minnesota Power and Light Company exercise its option to buy Deltona\'s utility subsidiaries 
4bhc0414 Based on current book value the subsidiaries would fetch thirty two \.POINT five million in cash plus preferred stock in one of the utility units 
4bhc0415 Topeka said it intends to exercise the option 
4bhc0416 Given the price of the stock it\'s a good use of the cash said William R\. Young an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Incorporated 
4bhc0417 They\'re definitely undervalued 
4bhc0418 For a premier chemical company to carry such a discount near the end of an economic cycle seems silly to me 
4bhc0419 A shortage of energy and raw materials is already wreaking havoc in many of China\'s major industries 
4bhc041a A factory that makes Nike shoes in Guangdong Province has to run a generator three days a week to stay in operation 
4bhc041b [tongue_click] The plant\'s Taiwanese joint venture partners are stockpiling coal and oil for power in case their supplies get cut off 
4bhc041c Many nearby Chinese factories simply shut down two or three days a week for want of energy [<door_slam] 
4bhc041d Moreover two thousand workers at the Tianjin aluminum products factory recently were ordered home because the company couldn\'t get enough raw materials 
4bhc041e At one point this year supply shortages forced a third of the nation\'s aluminum factories to close 
4bic0201 Richard MacDonald an analyst at First Boston Corporation said the results were in line with expectations

4bic020k To help cut production the U\. S\. is paying farmers an annual rent for ten years to idle erosion prone crop land under a conservation reserve program 
4bic020l What happens now

4bic020r The DeBartolos lost out in the bidding for Allied and Campeau Corporation a Toronto real estate firm 
4bic020s Carter Hawley avoided a takeover through a restructuring 
4bic020t Nevertheless some analysts say the Fed already may be tightening credit slightly 
4bic020u They point to recent increases in the federal funds rate which is the rate on reserves that banks lend each other overnight 
4bic020v The funds rate averaged at seven and five eighths \%PERCENT yesterday and Tuesday up from an average of seven \.POINT four three \%PERCENT in the week ended October seventh

4bic0213 A similar view is held by Greta E\. Marshall investment manager of the California Public Employees\' Retirement System which manages about forty four \.POINT four billion dollars 
4bic0214 I still see no evidence that inflation is picking up substantially she says

4bic0216 For the nineteen eighty seven third quarter the magazine group had pretax earnings of six \.POINT two million dollars on revenue of fifty nine \.POINT five million dollars 
4bic0217 The expected earnings drop reflects one fewer issue in the quarter of Family Circle 
4bic0218 Also the company cited development costs for three new magazines 
4bic0219 That fight while remarkable for its bitterness typifies the core problem of the nationwide push to contain medical costs Who gets less 
4bic021a Doctors want to maintain their authority and their incomes 
4bic021b Hospitals are fighting to hang onto revenue more than a third of which comes from Medicare 
4bic021c And patients don\'t want to see services decrease 
4bic021d But the health care system now consumes about a million dollars a minute and all agree it needs taming 
4bic021e Analysts say there are all sorts of reasons why the I\. P\. O\.s on one market might outperform those on another over a particular period 
4bic021f For one thing smaller stocks have outperformed larger issues for much of the span covered in N\. A\. S\. D\.\'s statistics

4bic0301 In nineteen eighty some government employees C\. I\. A\. had to give up First Amendment rights 
4bic0302 Now it is suggested that officials give up Fifth Amendment rights

4bic030k It would have been better to get these policy changes without the chaos of a declining market said Harvard economist Lawrence Summers 
4bic030l But if the market gets people to do what they should have been doing anyway it might help 
4bic030m To be sure the stock crash does raise the risk of recession 
4bic030n The benefits mentioned above will be overwhelmed if consumers and businesses are badly shaken and decide to sharply reduce their spending 
4bic030o An unusually weak Christmas buying season or widespread shelving of business investment plans could easily cause the market\'s problems to spread throughout the economy 
4bic030p Whether that happens depends far more on psychology than economics 
4bic030q We *emphatically* reject the idea that the executive branch subverted the law undermined the Constitution or threatened democracy 
4bic030r The president is every bit as much of an elected representative of the people as is a member of Congress 
4bic030s In fact he and the vice president are the only officials elected by the whole nation 
4bic030t Stanley Nabi executive vice president of Bessemer said They\'re not reducing their offer if you calculate the offer\'s value as of Thursday\'s close 
4bic030u I figure it was worth sixty five dollars and eighty five cents a share on Thursday 
4bic030v With Friday\'s revision it\'s worth sixty eight dollars a share 
4bic030w The revised terms are no less attractive than the original terms in the post crash market

4bic0311 In a statement *Nymex* effectively told Comex to back off

4bic0317 S\. D\. I\. despite what the Defense Luddites say is not an adventure in technology application 
4bic0318 It is a tool of national policy and as with any tool it is supposed to be used with a specific objective in mind 
4bic0319 The objective lest we forget it is to prevent a global nuclear war 
4bic031a I was shocked says Mr\. Kuhlenschmidt 
4bic031b I said there\'s something wrong here 
4bic031c I thought maybe they started selling ties in sizes 
4bic031d But I looked and there wasn\'t a size on it 
4bic0401 Mr\. Kinnear concedes that Texaco is being battered by its Pennzoil difficulties 
4bic0402 Legal expenses are monstrous 
4bic0403 Financial flexibility is reduced to the point where Texaco can\'t fix a major weakness dwindling oil supplies 
4bic0404 The company hasn\'t been able to get its commercial paper market going and endures increased borrowing costs Mr\. Kinnear says 
4bic0405 Major banks that once were eager to do business now aren\'t 
4bic0406 To raise five hundred million to six hundred million for instance the stock of some *subsidiaries* has been pledged to banks 
4bic0407 But if Texaco spends that money bank liens automatically will be placed on some Texaco assets says Richard Brinkman chief financial officer 
4bic0408 The issue is so sensitive here says bond analyst Daniel Scotto of L\. F\. *Rothschild* Unterberg and Towbin 
4bic0409 We are all concerned that the regulators can sit back and wait for credit to carry the company out into the horizon

4bic040b The Treasury rules however contain modifications of the S\. E\. C\. rules designed to improve protection of parties involved in repurchase agreements 
4bic040c In such agreements called repos one party sells government securities to another with the understanding that the seller will repurchase them at a specified price

4bic040h With less regulatory and political pressure Conrail was able to abandon about five thousand miles of track between nineteen eighty one and nineteen eighty six 
4bic040i About half of that has been taken up by short line railroads nonunion railroads that have continued to provide the service at a lesser cost

4bic040t After high prices and frantic bidding at art auctions last spring about one in four works didn\'t sell at a contemporary art auction at Christie\'s 
4bic040u But at least the market didn\'t crash 
4bic040v But for the longer term figuring out what to do about computerized trading may be an impossible task some investors fear 
4bic040w I\'d love for all this stuff to just go away 
4bic040x But it\'s like nuclear energy says John B\. Carroll the vice president of G\. T\. E\.\'s Corporation\'s investment management unit

4bic0411 To make them directly comparable each index is based on the close of nineteen sixty nine equaling one hundred 
4bic0412 The percentage *change* is since year end 
4bic0413 The company said it didn\'t see any factors that might adversely affect its results for the second half of the year 
4bic0414 Order inflow and order backlog are clearly above the previous year\'s levels B\. S\. A\. F\. said 
4bic0415 It didn\'t provide any details 
4bic0416 Mr\. Papageorge said These were conceptual negotiations 
4bic0417 Ideas were flowing

4bic0419 The two of us were trying to think of a way to satisfy everyone 
4bic041a This hasn\'t been a good year for Sundstrand 
4bic041b The Rockford Illinois aerospace contractor expects to pay out one hundred million dollars in a government contract dispute 
4bic041c It is forecasting lower earnings 
4bic041d An Upjohn spokeswoman said the company planned to market Rogaine to women all along 
4bic041e However F\. D\. A\. approval for using the drug on men came first because Upjohn didn\'t test the product on enough women initially

4bjc0201 Mr\. Kato takes advantage of his company\'s share purchase plan 
4bjc0202 Mitsubishi subsidizes its employees who buy the company\'s shares by paying ten \%PERCENT of the purchase price 
4bjc0203 He figures that he gets a much better return that way than by putting money in the bank 
4bjc0204 He is credited with drilling the presidents of Trust Company\'s eighteen Georgia banks on those fundamentals setting ambitious profit targets and holding the banks strictly accountable for reaching them 
4bjc0205 Now Sun\'s twenty six Florida banks get the same treatment from Mr\. Williams 
4bjc0206 There\'s a lot of [misc_noise>] autonomy but you\'ve got to earn it says Thomas S\. Clark the marketing director at Sun\'s Polk County bank 
4bjc0207 Just what Shuwa has in mind isn\'t clear 
4bjc0208 A spokesman in the U\. S\. says the idea is to create a clearinghouse for the sales of U\. S\. properties both Shuwa\'s and those owned by others 
4bjc0209 Shuwa says it isn\'t aiming to sell to individual investors but to institutions and large investors 
4bjc020a Still the sales office is unusual for institutional business moreover it will be on the Ginza an address closely associated with retail shopping 
4bjc020b The altered memo however never mentioned the president 
4bjc020c Instead it recommended only that the current donors be approached to provide fifteen to twenty million additional dollars 
4bjc020d At the time Saudi Arabia already had contributed thirty two million dollars to the Contras 
4bjc020e Mr\. Junger previously has denied any wrongdoing and has said that he isn\'t responsible for the currency loss 
4bjc020f He was summarily dismissed by the company when the currency loss came to light ending his severance contract that was to run until September

4bjc020q There are many areas geographically and in the skill categories that we lack he said 
4bjc020r He said areas he hopes to fill in include a financial public relations company in New York and acquisitions in the Midwest 
4bjc020s I currently have twenty six conversations in progress although I can\'t guess how many will pan out he said 
4bjc020t However net losses in Eurodollar bond prices were estimated at only one eighth to three eighths point by traders 
4bjc020u The benchmark Canadian nine \%PERCENT bonds due in nineteen ninety six were bid thirty basis points lower 
4bjc020v The Eurodollar bond market still has a [door_slam>] lot of underlying strength said a senior trader for one European bank 
4bjc020w But at another operation in rural northern Illinois there are hardly any minorities to draw from 
4bjc020x We picked that location because we needed the river access there to be successful Mr\. Thompson says 
4bjc020y I know I have a social responsibility 
4bjc020z But I also have a responsibility to my shareholders 
4bjc0210 We seem to be ready to take a little rest said one participant 
4bjc0211 I don\'t think people are either screamingly worried or screamingly excited about this market said another 
4bjc0212 I think the attitude has got to be that *we\'ve* been outperforming the other world markets and now the other markets may be outperforming this one a little 
4bjc0213 New campaign co chairman Laxalt will serve as an intermediary with the Reagans even after eight years Bush still feels awkward talking to them 
4bjc0214 Some strategists think Reagan\'s recent rash of patently partisan moves has been a mistake 
4bjc0215 One explanation the desire of chief staff Duberstein earlier viewed as a Dole supporter to ingratiate himself with Bush 
4bjc0216 Mr\. Taylor will remain president a post he has held since May first 
4bjc0217 He also has served since the beginning of the year as chief operating officer that position will be eliminated next Tuesday 
4bjc0218 Previously he was president of Cigna\'s property casualty group for five years and served as chief financial officer 
4bjc0219 The operation was a pirate 
4bjc021a They had opened without our blessing says Robert Earl president of the U\. S\. operations 
4bjc021b We brought in our discipline and now it\'s doing exceptionally well

4bjc021e Motorola Incorporated MIPS Computer Systems Incorporated and Hewlett Packard Company are jockeying to woo computer makers to use their own RISC chips

4bjc0301 For Kodak a five hundred million dollar penalty would represent about a dollar fifty a share after taxes 
4bjc0302 It might be seen as a victory for Kodak says Alex 
4bjc0303 Brown analyst Otis Bradley in a recent report 
4bjc0304 Yesterday Kodak climbed two and three quarters to seventy five and three eighths 
4bjc0305 It reported first quarter profit rose to seventy nine cents a share from twenty two cents a share 
4bjc0306 But there appear to be some major catches 
4bjc0307 Many banks that cut rates have small numbers of cards outstanding 
4bjc0308 In other cases lower rates are available only to the most creditworthy customers 
4bjc0309 And certain rate reductions are being offset by higher annual fees and elimination of interest free grace periods 
4bjc030a Now the two units are for sale for f:ifty thousand dollars and two hundred and forty thousand dollars maybe half their peak values of three years ago

4bjc030j Does that mean a cabinet post 
4bjc030k Yeah says Mr\. Iacocca 
4bjc030l Maybe 
4bjc030m More likely though Mr\. Iacocca would prefer to be a part of an informal group of presidential advisers 
4bjc030n Earlier this year the sixty three year old executive signed a new four year contract with Chrysler 
4bjc030o And in Tuesday\'s interview Mr\. Iacocca maintained that he wants to lead the company into the nineteen nineties

4bjc030q In the old magazine everything was smooth neat and tidy says Ms\. Wintour 
4bjc030r It was as if no one lived there 
4bjc030s Now the focus will be less on the empty room and more on the personality behind it 
4bjc030t Most funerals are terribly dignified affairs 
4bjc030u Dignified music dignified words and from the florist dignified flower arrangements 
4bjc030v Almost an excess of dignity you might say 
4bjc030w Shortly afterward [door_slam>] N\. B\. C\. said it wouldn\'t move on the Trump site 
4bjc030x Henry Kanegsberg an official of the General Electric Company unit cited community fervor as a big reason 
4bjc030y I live on the West Side and we see what\'s going on there he said 
4bjc030z The resistance is likely to use more conventional warfare 
4bjc0310 It may try to seize strongholds while also relying on inside agents to kill officials in the Afghan government and its intelligence service the Khad 
4bjc0311 The aim would be to demoralize officials and force them into exile 
4bjc0312 But Mr\. Conable\'s own nature isn\'t clear Representative LaFalce argues 
4bjc0313 Barber Conable is an outstanding person he says 
4bjc0314 He had a strong identity here in Congress which he earned 
4bjc0315 But he doesn\'t have his own identity as president of the World Bank 
4bjc0316 He was created by Jim Baker and George Bush in this job 
4bjc0317 His reputation now rests on how he defines himself 
4bjc0318 Unisys placed six employees on leave while they are being investigated in the Pentagon procurement scandal 
4bjc0319 The computer company also tightened management control over its use of consultants 
4bjc031a Separately Unisys disclosed two more federal inquiries into its defense business that are unrelated to the scandal 
4bjc031b Where do you go around here to have a good cry said the likable seeming thirty five year old in the press tent afterward 
4bjc031c Choking back sobs he remarked It\'s only a game right 
4bjc031d When asked he said that even the outlet of going home and kicking his dog wasn\'t available

4bjc040d The railroad went bankrupt in nineteen seventy and in nineteen seventy two it hired Mr\. Cobb to run Arvida 
4bjc040e John Jennings vice president of science and technology of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers\' Association said Doctor Peck may have two scientists below him handling drug review 
4bjc040f Two portals instead of one headed by two fine scientists may mean speedier handling of new drug applications Doctor Jennings said 
4bjc040g But if that door is just painted on he added it may not change a lot 
4bjc040h The agency said in an order that the staff recommended on August twentieth that the one \.POINT three billion dollar sale be approved 
4bjc040i But the F\. C\. C\. says it wants to review the recommendation and halted the sale until it concludes that review
