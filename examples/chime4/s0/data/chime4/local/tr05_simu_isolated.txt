029_029C0203_BUS.CH1_SIMU THE PROPOSED ACQUISITION BY BALLY IS WIDELY PERCEIVED AS AN EFFORT TO SCUTTLE A TAKEOVER ATTEMPT BY MR. TRUMP
029_029C0204_STR.CH1_SIMU ALL INDICATIONS SUGGEST THOUGH THAT THE REAGAN NAKASONE SUMMIT WILL NOT BE ABOUT MONETARY POLICIES
029_029C0205_CAF.CH1_SIMU THEY WILL DISCUSS TRADE ISSUES WHICH ARE CERTAINLY IMPORTANT BUT RATHER REMOTE FROM THE IMMEDIATE PROBLEM
029_029C0206_STR.CH1_SIMU ALL OF THE WORLD'S EXPORTS AND IMPORTS COME TO ABOUT TWO TRILLION DOLLARS A YEAR
029_029C0207_STR.CH1_SIMU BUT FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET TRADING AMOUNTS TO ABOUT ONE TRILLION DOLLARS A WEEK
029_029C0208_BUS.CH1_SIMU IT IS THE FINANCIAL MARKETS THAT THE BATTLE OF THE DOLLAR WILL HAVE TO BE FOUGHT
029_029C0209_CAF.CH1_SIMU INVESTORS RANGING FROM U. S. CORPORATIONS TO JAPANESE BUYERS OF U. S. TREASURY BILLS MUST FACTOR IN A RISK PREMIUM FOR DOLLAR VALIDITY
029_029C020A_STR.CH1_SIMU THUS IT IS AT LEAST PLAUSIBLE IF NOT LIKELY THAT DOLLAR VALIDITY IS ONE REASON REAL INTEREST RATES HAVE STAYED HIGH IN THE U. S.
029_029C020B_BUS.CH1_SIMU IT IS CERTAINLY TRUE THAT NO PLAN TO RESTORE STABILITY TO WORLD MARKETS CAN SUCCEED WITHOUT ADDRESSING DOLLAR VALIDITY
029_029C020C_CAF.CH1_SIMU THERE IS A GROWING MIDDLE CLASS OF COLOMBIANS WHO HAVE WORKED THEIR WAY UP AND ARE NOW BUYING THEIR OWN HOMES AND IMPROVING THEIR STANDARDS OF LIVING
029_029C020D_CAF.CH1_SIMU THEY ARE AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE STABILITY OF THE ECONOMY ABHOR VIOLENCE AND ARE USUALLY PRO U. S.
029_029C020E_PED.CH1_SIMU FURTHER THE HOSPITALITY AND KINDNESS OF THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE ARE SUPERB
029_029C020F_STR.CH1_SIMU I FOUND THIS TO BE TRUE NOT JUST IN THE MAJOR CITIES BUT ALSO IN AREAS THAT THE STATE DEPARTMENT CONSIDERED RISKY
029_029C020G_STR.CH1_SIMU THERE IS NO SHORTAGE OF EXAMPLES
029_029C020H_PED.CH1_SIMU GROWING LIFE EXPECTANCY THREATENS TO BANKRUPT SOCIAL SECURITY BUT THE COMPROMISE OF NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE DID LITTLE MORE THAN BURDEN WORKERS BY RAISING THE PAYROLL TAX
029_029C020I_BUS.CH1_SIMU THE GOVERNMENT CONTINUES TO PILE UP GREAT DEFICITS BUT THE BUDGET SUMMIT COMPROMISE OF LAST AUTUMN HARDLY CUTS ANYTHING AT ALL
029_029C020J_BUS.CH1_SIMU SOVIET INFLUENCE IN NICARAGUA THREATENS U. S. SECURITY BUT THE U. S. HOUSE ENGAGES IN A PITCHED BATTLE OVER EVEN SCRAPS OF MILITARY HARDWARE TO THE CONTRAS
029_029C020K_CAF.CH1_SIMU I THINK THE MARKET JUMPED THE GUN ON THE NOTION OF A WEAK ECONOMY AND THE FED EASING MR. FINE SAID
029_029C020L_CAF.CH1_SIMU SO WHAT WE'RE SEEING NOW IS A CONSOLIDATION
029_029C020M_BUS.CH1_SIMU HE EXPECTS LONG TERM TREASURY BOND YIELDS TO HOVER AROUND THE EIGHT AND ONE HALF PERCENT LEVEL IN THE NEAR FUTURE
029_029C020N_CAF.CH1_SIMU THE STANDOFF CASTS DOUBTS ABOUT HOW SINCERE JAPANESE COMPANIES ARE IN THEIR STATED WILLINGNESS TO BUY MORE U. S. MADE CHIPS
029_029C020O_STR.CH1_SIMU IT ALSO COULD STYMIE A NEW NEGOTIATING APPROACH IN WHICH THE INDUSTRIES NOT THE GOVERNMENTS IRON OUT TRADE DISPUTES
029_029C020P_STR.CH1_SIMU THAT COULD DRIVE AMERICAN CHIP MAKERS TO ASK THE U. S. GOVERNMENT FOR MORE PUNITIVE MEASURES AGAINST JAPAN
029_029C020Q_STR.CH1_SIMU DURING ANY REPAIR PROCESS BLOOD CLOTS ARE CONSTANTLY BEING FORMED AND DISSOLVED
029_029C020R_CAF.CH1_SIMU IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE SCIENTISTS SPECULATE THAT DURING ATTEMPTS TO REPAIR THE ARTERY WALL THE BODY AT SOME POINT TRIES TO DISSOLVE A BLOOD CLOT
029_029C020S_CAF.CH1_SIMU BUT IT MISTAKENLY GRABS PROTEIN INSTEAD OF PLASMINOGEN PULLING IT WITH ITS BAG OF FAT AND CHOLESTEROL INTO THE ARTERY WALL
029_029C020T_PED.CH1_SIMU THIS THWARTS THE REPAIR PROCESS AND BEGINS A VICIOUS CYCLE DRAWING MORE AND MORE CHOLESTEROL INTO THE DAMAGED AREA
029_029C020U_STR.CH1_SIMU AND IN FACT MICROSCOPIC BLOOD CLOTS AND BITS OF LP ARE FOUND IN THE MISHMASH OF THE DEPOSITS
029_029C020V_STR.CH1_SIMU IF THE SETTLEMENT IS COMPLETED THE COMPANY WOULD JOIN SHAREHOLDER PLAINTIFFS IN SEEKING DAMAGES AGAINST FOUNDER EDDIE ANTAR AND OTHERS
029_029C020W_CAF.CH1_SIMU CRAZY EDDIE CURRENTLY IS A DEFENDANT IN THE HOLDERS' LITIGATION
029_029C020X_CAF.CH1_SIMU THE NEW MANAGEMENT HAS ACCUSED MR. ANTAR IN COURT AND REGULATORY FILINGS OF ENGAGING IN A POSSIBLE SCHEME TO FALSIFY INVENTORY AND PROFIT REPORTS
029_029C020Y_PED.CH1_SIMU AND IT DOESN'T APPEAR THAT CABLE OWNERS WILL RESIST THE CHANGE
029_029C020Z_BUS.CH1_SIMU A SPOKESMAN FOR THE NATIONAL CABLE TELEVISION ASSOCIATION SAID WE DON'T OPPOSE THE PROPOSAL IN PRINCIPLE
029_029C0210_CAF.CH1_SIMU WE TAKE THE POSITION THAT THE MORE PEOPLE IN THE CABLE MARKET THE BETTER
029_029C0211_PED.CH1_SIMU THE SALE ANNOUNCEMENT WAS NOT WIDELY EXPECTED
029_029C0212_STR.CH1_SIMU BUT DESPITE THE ELEMENT OF SURPRISE THE NEWS HAD LITTLE NET EFFECT ON THE SECONDARY MARKET FOR NEW YORK BONDS
029_029C0213_PED.CH1_SIMU THERE ISN'T ENOUGH SUPPLY FOR THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE SIZABLE OFFERING TO HAVE MUCH IMPACT EXPLAINED ONE TRADER

40D_40DC020R_STR.CH1_SIMU BUT TO IDENTIFY THE PLANE BY NUMBER OR FLIGHT TIME HE ADDED WOULD BE AN ADMISSION OF OUR OWN CULPABILITY IN THE PROBLEM

40E_40EC0207_CAF.CH1_SIMU MUCH OF THE OPTIMISM FUELING WESTERN FINANCIAL FLOWS TO THE SOVIETS IS A REACTION TO MR. GORBACHEV'S GLASNOST
