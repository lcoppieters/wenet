01K_01KO031G_BUS.CH1_SIMU Revenue for the latest quarter rose sixty one \%PERCENT to four hundred seven million dollars from two hundred fifty three million dollars \.PERIOD 
01L_01LC0201_CAF.CH1_SIMU The review committee tries to offer a menu of small medium and large capitalization stocks 
01L_01LC0202_BUS.CH1_SIMU Some of its most successful picks were quite small companies when first recommended 
01L_01LC0203_PED.CH1_SIMU Money managers minding billion dollar portfolios on the other hand often avoid smaller stocks because they can\'t purchase a significant stake without affecting the price 
01L_01LC0204_BUS.CH1_SIMU Still even a major slowdown could permit hefty fund growth considering last year\'s record gross sales to investors of two hundred sixteen billion dollars 
01L_01LC0205_CAF.CH1_SIMU Net nineteen eighty six sales after redemptions were one hundred forty eight point eight billion dollars 
01L_01LC0206_BUS.CH1_SIMU A spot survey here showed that many executives think both gross and net sales for the industry this year may range from flat to down thirty percent from last year 
01L_01LC0207_BUS.CH1_SIMU A loss wasn\'t unexpected given Continental\'s operational difficulties that developed in the quarter 
01L_01LC0208_BUS.CH1_SIMU However the results of Texas Air\'s subsidiaries are the reverse of what many analysts had predicted earlier in the year 
01L_01LC0209_PED.CH1_SIMU Instead of a modest profit at low cost Continental by the second quarter the newly expanded unit has struggled with losses 
01L_01LC020A_CAF.CH1_SIMU Its higher cost sister Eastern Airlines has shown signs of financial progress despite continuing confrontations with its employee unions 
01L_01LC020B_PED.CH1_SIMU Humana tried to defend itself through diversification as did the other large chains Hospital Corporation of America American Medical International Incorporated and National Medical Enterprises Incorporated 
01L_01LC020C_BUS.CH1_SIMU The idea was that if a hospital owner also had an insurance plan it could steer patients to its institutions through financial incentives 
01L_01LC020D_STR.CH1_SIMU The patient pool might shrink but the company could grab a bigger part of it 
01L_01LC020E_PED.CH1_SIMU The Blackstone fund Blackstone Capital Partners L\. P\. is seeking to raise one billion dollars 
01L_01LC020F_PED.CH1_SIMU It has already gathered six hundred million dollars to seven hundred million dollars fund officials said 
01L_01LC020G_CAF.CH1_SIMU The fund\'s limited partners include some of the largest most powerful corporations in the world said Peter G\. Peterson Blackstone Group\'s chairman 
01L_01LC020H_STR.CH1_SIMU In July and August U\. S\. G\. offered early retirement incentives that resulted in the elimination of more than one hundred mostly salaried positions 
01L_01LC020I_CAF.CH1_SIMU The incentives resulted in a nine point nine million dollar pretax charge against third quarter earnings 
01L_01LC020J_CAF.CH1_SIMU The positions eliminated through early retirement are expected to reduce overhead in future years by seven point six million dollars the company said 
01L_01LC020K_STR.CH1_SIMU Northgate declined to estimate the size of an expected gain on the sale 
01L_01LC020L_PED.CH1_SIMU The company said net proceeds of about one hundred thirty million dollars will be mainly used to finance gold mining acquisitions 
01L_01LC020M_PED.CH1_SIMU Northgate said it will seek pure gold mines only 
01L_01LC020N_PED.CH1_SIMU Neither Mr\. Cullinane nor Mr\. Chapman who also is fifty three could be reached for comment 
01L_01LC020O_CAF.CH1_SIMU Westwood Massachusetts based Cullinet disclosed the action in response to questions 
01L_01LC020P_BUS.CH1_SIMU It said it planned a formal announcement today 
01L_01LC020Q_CAF.CH1_SIMU S\. D\. I\. despite what the Defense Luddites say is not an adventure in technology application 
01L_01LC020R_STR.CH1_SIMU It is a tool of national policy and as with any tool it is supposed to be used with a specific objective in mind 
01L_01LC020S_STR.CH1_SIMU The objective lest we forget it is to prevent a global nuclear war 
01L_01LC020T_BUS.CH1_SIMU Within an hour Barclays P\. L\. C\. Lloyds Bank P\. L\. C\. and the London unit of Citicorp increased their base rates 
01L_01LC020U_PED.CH1_SIMU The Barclays boost took effect immediately while the other two banks\' moves were effective at the close of business 
01L_01LC020V_PED.CH1_SIMU Similar increases by National Westminster Bank P\. L\. C\. and Midland Bank P\. L\. C\. go into effect today 
01L_01LC020W_PED.CH1_SIMU Base rates are the benchmark for commercial lending in Britain 
01L_01LC020X_CAF.CH1_SIMU More important than arithmetic however is Mr\. Jackson\'s message 
01L_01LC020Y_STR.CH1_SIMU Speaking to black aspirations he represents the best of the American dream 
01L_01LC020Z_PED.CH1_SIMU He might even qualify as a social conservative if not for his endorsement of homosexual rights 
01L_01LC0210_STR.CH1_SIMU So far the administration has ignored these appeals and so have Mr\. Reed and other bankers 
01L_01LC0211_CAF.CH1_SIMU It seems that the principles enunciated at the beginning of this debate by Messrs\. 
01L_01LC0212_BUS.CH1_SIMU Wriston and Theobald still prevail if not in lending the bank\'s money at least in suggesting that other investors put up the cash 
01L_01LC0213_BUS.CH1_SIMU The average daily trading volume in R\. J\. R\. Nabisco options in September was about one thousand contracts Mr\. Moulds said 
01L_01LC0214_PED.CH1_SIMU Last Tuesday more than four thousand options traded on Wednesday the day preceding the announcement seven thousand fifty contracts traded 
01L_01LC0215_STR.CH1_SIMU After the buy out proposal was made public Thursday twenty five thousand eight hundred fifty R\. J\. R\. Nabisco options traded on the C\. B\. O\. E\. 
01L_01LC0216_BUS.CH1_SIMU I was envious of my team\'s snatcher a tall skinny nurse until I saw what she had to endure in the name of esprit de corps

01L_01LC0218_CAF.CH1_SIMU Her torso was taut with tension leaning out beyond the bumpy dragon\'s head upon which she rested her stomach 
01L_01LC0219_PED.CH1_SIMU There are still legislative issues to be resolved on the Senate floor and among four House committees before the bill reaches the House floor 
01L_01LC021A_STR.CH1_SIMU Business groups for example are unhappy at provisions requiring bus companies to install wheelchair lifts and handicapped toilets in new over the road buses 
01L_01LC021B_CAF.CH1_SIMU The groups also criticize the lack of a blanket small business exemption for public accommodations 
01L_01LC021C_PED.CH1_SIMU But many other business objections have already been dealt with in the White House Senate negotiations pretty much eliminating the chances that the measure could yet be derailed 
01L_01LC021D_STR.CH1_SIMU To the extent that export growth continues it will keep the U\. S\. economy from slipping added Mr\. Witten 
01L_01LC021E_STR.CH1_SIMU So you can have a soft landing scenario based on expanding exports

029_029C0202_CAF.CH1_SIMU As previously reported Mr\. Trump is seeking to prevent Bally from buying Golden Nugget Incorporated\'s casino hotel in Atlantic City N\. J\. 
029_029C0203_BUS.CH1_SIMU The proposed acquisition by Bally is widely perceived as an effort to scuttle a takeover attempt by Mr\. Trump 
029_029C0204_STR.CH1_SIMU All indications suggest though that the Reagan Nakasone summit will not be about monetary policies 
029_029C0205_CAF.CH1_SIMU They will discuss trade issues which are certainly important but rather remote from the immediate problem 
029_029C0206_STR.CH1_SIMU All of the world\'s exports and imports come to about two trillion dollars a year 
029_029C0207_STR.CH1_SIMU But foreign exchange market trading amounts to about one trillion dollars a week 
029_029C0208_BUS.CH1_SIMU It is the financial markets that the battle of the dollar will have to be fought 
029_029C0209_CAF.CH1_SIMU Investors ranging from U\. S\. corporations to Japanese buyers of U\. S\. treasury bills must factor in a risk premium for dollar validity 
029_029C020A_STR.CH1_SIMU Thus it is at least plausible if not likely that dollar validity is one reason real interest rates have stayed high in the U\. S\. 
029_029C020B_BUS.CH1_SIMU It is certainly true that no plan to restore stability to world markets can succeed without addressing dollar validity 
029_029C020C_CAF.CH1_SIMU There is a growing middle class of Colombians who have worked their way up and are now buying their own homes and improving their standards of living 
029_029C020D_CAF.CH1_SIMU They are an important part of the stability of the economy abhor violence and are usually pro U\. S\.

029_029C020G_STR.CH1_SIMU There is no shortage of examples 
029_029C020H_PED.CH1_SIMU Growing life expectancy threatens to bankrupt Social Security but the compromise of nineteen eighty three did little more than burden workers by raising the payroll tax 
029_029C020I_BUS.CH1_SIMU The government continues to pile up great deficits but the budget summit compromise of last autumn hardly cuts anything at all 
029_029C020J_BUS.CH1_SIMU Soviet influence in Nicaragua threatens U\. S\. security but the U\. S\. House engages in a pitched battle over even scraps of military hardware to the Contras

029_029C020M_BUS.CH1_SIMU He expects long term Treasury bond yields to hover around the eight and one half percent level in the near future 
029_029C020N_CAF.CH1_SIMU The standoff casts doubts about how sincere Japanese companies are in their stated willingness to buy more U\. S\. made chips 
029_029C020O_STR.CH1_SIMU It also could stymie a new negotiating approach in which the industries not the governments iron out trade disputes 
029_029C020P_STR.CH1_SIMU That could drive American chip makers to ask the U\. S\. government for more punitive measures against Japan 
029_029C020Q_STR.CH1_SIMU During any repair process blood clots are constantly being formed and dissolved 
029_029C020R_CAF.CH1_SIMU It is quite possible scientists speculate that during attempts to repair the artery wall the body at some point tries to dissolve a blood clot 
029_029C020S_CAF.CH1_SIMU But it mistakenly grabs protein instead of plasminogen pulling it with its bag of fat and cholesterol into the artery wall 
029_029C020T_PED.CH1_SIMU This thwarts the repair process and begins a vicious cycle drawing more and more cholesterol into the damaged area 
029_029C020U_STR.CH1_SIMU And in fact microscopic blood clots and bits of Lp are found in the mishmash of the deposits 
029_029C020V_STR.CH1_SIMU If the settlement is completed the company would join shareholder plaintiffs in seeking damages against founder Eddie Antar and others 
029_029C020W_CAF.CH1_SIMU Crazy Eddie currently is a defendant in the holders\' litigation 
029_029C020X_CAF.CH1_SIMU The new management has accused Mr\. Antar in court and regulatory filings of engaging in a possible scheme to falsify inventory and profit reports 
029_029C020Y_PED.CH1_SIMU And it doesn\'t appear that cable owners will resist the change 
029_029C020Z_BUS.CH1_SIMU A spokesman for the National Cable Television Association said We don\'t oppose the proposal in principle 
029_029C0210_CAF.CH1_SIMU We take the position that the more people in the cable market the better 
029_029C0211_PED.CH1_SIMU The sale announcement was not widely expected 
029_029C0212_STR.CH1_SIMU But despite the element of surprise the news had little net effect on the secondary market for New York bonds 
029_029C0213_PED.CH1_SIMU There isn\'t enough supply for the announcement of the sizable offering to have much impact explained one trader
