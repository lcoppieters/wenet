01ic020r WHEN A MAJOR NATIONAL RETAILER WENT THROUGH A COST CUTTING PERIOD A NUMBER OF OLDER EXECUTIVES WERE DISCHARGED AT THE SAME TIME AS THE CONSOLIDATION OF DEPARTMENTS
01ic020s THESE EXECUTIVES BANDED TOGETHER AND INSTITUTED A CLASS ACTION SUIT AGAINST THE FORMER EMPLOYER
01ic020t A VERY SIMILAR CASE OCCURRED WITH ANOTHER NATIONAL RETAILER THAT SOUGHT TO REDUCE ITS OVERHEAD AND OPERATING EXPENSES

01lc0219 THERE ARE STILL LEGISLATIVE ISSUES TO BE RESOLVED ON THE SENATE FLOOR AND AMONG FOUR HOUSE COMMITTEES BEFORE THE BILL REACHES THE HOUSE FLOOR

029c0209 INVESTORS RANGING FROM U. S. CORPORATIONS TO JAPANESE BUYERS OF U. S. TREASURY BILLS MUST FACTOR IN A RISK PREMIUM FOR DOLLAR VALIDITY
029c020a THUS IT IS AT LEAST PLAUSIBLE IF NOT LIKELY THAT DOLLAR VALIDITY IS ONE REASON REAL INTEREST RATES HAVE STAYED HIGH IN THE U. S.
029c020b IT IS CERTAINLY TRUE THAT NO PLAN TO RESTORE STABILITY TO WORLD MARKETS CAN SUCCEED WITHOUT ADDRESSING DOLLAR VALIDITY

029c020s BUT IT MISTAKENLY GRABS PROTEIN INSTEAD OF PLASMINOGEN PULLING IT WITH ITS BAG OF FAT AND CHOLESTEROL INTO THE ARTERY WALL
029c020t THIS THWARTS THE REPAIR PROCESS AND BEGINS A VICIOUS CYCLE DRAWING MORE AND MORE CHOLESTEROL INTO THE DAMAGED AREA

409c020d ONE CHARACTERISTIC OF USER FEES IS THAT THEY REVEAL HOW MUCH GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS ARE REALLY WORTH TO DIRECT RECIPIENTS IN THE MOST DIRECT AND MEANINGFUL WAY POSSIBLE
409c020e ONE OF THE STRONGEST ARGUMENTS THAT A GOVERNMENT PROGRAM IS WORTHWHILE OCCURS WHEN IT HAS A USER FEE AND THE FEE COVERS COSTS
