460c0201 <NOISE> EARLIER THIS WEEK DEFENSE SECRETARY CASPAR WEINBERGER TOLD REPORTERS AT A BREAKFAST MEETING THAT THE B. ONE'S PROBLEMS WEREN'T SERIOUS
460c0202 THERE ARE ALSO PROBLEMS WITH THE NEW PLANES HE SAID
460c0203 THE B. ONE HOWEVER IS A VERY GOOD BOMBER
460c0204 WITH MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS OF REPORTED STOCK *ASSETS* THE INVESTMENT ADVISERS CONTROL A SIZABLE CHUNK OF PENSION ASSETS AND PRIVATE PORTFOLIOS
460c0205 INVESTMENT *ADVISERS* TEND TO BE SMALL PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS WHOSE OWNERS MANAGE THE PORTFOLIOS <NOISE>
460c0206 THEY ARE OFTEN KNOWN FOR A MAVERICK INVESTMENT STRATEGIES AND HIGH FEES
460c0207 BUYING CORPORATE ZEROS FOR AN I. R. A. NEUTRALIZES THEIR MOST OBVIOUS DISADVANTAGE THE TAX TREATMENT
460c0208 WITH RARE EXCEPTIONS SUCH BONDS TRIGGER PERSONAL INCOME TAX EACH YEAR ON THE THEORETICAL ACCUMULATION OR ACCRETION OF INTEREST
460c0209 THAT MEANS INVESTORS PAY TAX ON MONEY THEY HAVEN'T YET RECEIVED
460c020a IF THE BONDS ARE BOUGHT FOR AN I. R. A. HOWEVER NO TAX IS DUE UNTIL THE MONEY IS WITHDRAWN
460c020b AFTER MUCH CONFLICT SECRETARY OF STATE CYRUS VANCE STRUCK A DEAL IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN
460c020c EACH EMBASSY COMPLEX HAD TO BE OCCUPIED SIMULTANEOUSLY
460c020d CONSTRUCTION OF THE SOVIET UNION'S WASHINGTON EMBASSY WAS COMPLETED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE BEFORE WORK ON THE U. S.'S NEW MOSCOW EMBASSY HAD EVEN STARTED
460c020e THE SOVIETS THEN PUSHED TO OCCUPY THEIR NEW SITE BUT THE U. S. RESISTED UNTIL ITS OWN BUILDINGS WERE READY
460c020f AS THE U. S. BUILDINGS WERE COMPLETED IN MOSCOW THE SOVIETS WERE ALLOWED TO MOVE INTO SOME OF THEIR NEW FACILITIES ON MOUNT ALTO
460c020g ONLY THE MAIN AMBASSADORIAL BUILDING AT EACH SITE ARE VACANT
460c020h MR. BEGEL SAID PULLMAN WILL FINANCE THE PURCHASE THROUGH ITS EXISTING CREDIT LINES
460c020i ALSO PULLMAN HAS ABOUT FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN CASH HE SAID
460c020j PULLMAN EARNED SIXTEEN POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN ON *REVENUE* OF FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
460c020k THE RECAPITALIZATION WAS PROPOSED TO THWART A TAKEOVER EFFORT BY BRITISH PRINTING AND COMMUNICATION CORPORATION
460c020l THE OXFORD ENGLAND PUBLISHING AND PRINTING CONCERN CONTROLLED BY ROBERT MAXWELL FILED SUIT IN FEDERAL COURT IN NEW YORK THIS WEEK TO BLOCK THE RECAPITALIZATION
460c020m A COURT VICTORY WOULD PAVE THE WAY FOR MR. MAXWELL TO MAKE A NEW OFFER FOR HARCOURT
460c020n <NOISE> CAPTAIN OVERHEARING THE RADIO DISCUSSION ABOUT RUNWAY OH FIVE I UNDERSTOOD NOTHING
460c020o AND WHAT RUNWAY
460c020p WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
460c020q <NOISE> STILL SECURITIES AND BANKING *REGULATORS* WORRY WHETHER THEY ARE ACTING FAST ENOUGH TO SAFEGUARD AGAINST GROWING RISKS IN THE WORLD'S FINANCIAL MARKETS
460c020r <NOISE> MANY AGREE THERE IS LITTLE TIME TO WASTE IN THE SCRAMBLE TO CREATE BETTER INTERNATIONAL REGULATION
460c020s AS MR. FELDSTEIN SAYS YOU CAN'T JUST LOOK AT THE BUILDING AND SAY IT HASN'T FALLEN DOWN YET SO WE SHOULD BE SAFE
460c020t THEN SECRETARY HAIG TOOK HIS PLAN TO THE WHITE HOUSE
460c020u <NOISE> HE INSISTED THAT THE STATE DEPARTMENT MUST CONTROL THE POLICY AND EVEN ASKED THE PRESIDENT TO ORDER THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT TO SUPPLY PERSONNEL TO HELP PLAN DETAILS
460c020v THE IDEA WAS REJECTED
460c020w NOT LONG AGO TENNECO WAS CONSIDERED AN UNLIKELY *RESTRUCTURING* CANDIDATE
460c020x ITS HEAVY DEBTS AND DEPRESSED ENERGY AND FARM EQUIPMENT BUSINESSES MADE IT APPEAR IMMUNE TO RAIDERS
460c020y BUT THE COMPANY'S IMPROVING BUSINESS PROSPECTS AND ASSET VALUES HAVE CHANGED THAT
460c020z <NOISE> A SOUTH KOREAN AIRLINER VANISHED SOMEWHERE NEAR BURMA AND APPARENTLY CRASHED INTO THE SEA OR THICK JUNGLE OFFICIALS IN SEOUL SAID
460c0210 THE KOREAN AIR JET WITH A HUNDRED FIFTY PEOPLE ABROAD WAS EN ROUTE TO SEOUL FROM BAGHDAD WHEN AVIATION OFFICIALS LOST CONTACT WITH THE PLANE
460c0211 K. A. L. OFFICIALS WOULDN'T RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF HIJACKING OR SABOTAGE
460c0212 BUT OTHERS NOTABLY WELLS FARGO INVESTMENT ADVISERS PRESSED ON
460c0213 WE FELT THAT THE FUTURES MARKET REFLECTED ACTUAL TRADING LEVELS AT THE TIME SAYS FRED GRAUER THE HEAD OF WELLS FARGO AND COMPANY SUBSIDIARY
460c0214 MANY STOCK PRICES HADN'T BEEN UPDATED IN SEVERAL MINUTES HE EXPLAINS AND IT WAS LIKELY THAT SUBSEQUENT STOCK TRADES WOULD BE AT EVEN LOWER LEVELS
460c0215 BY DAY'S END WELLS SOLD FOURTEEN THOUSAND FUTURES CONTRACTS AMOUNTING TO NEARLY TWO BILLION DOLLARS
460c0216 EVENTUALLY THE FLIGHT LANDED AT A NEARBY AIRPORT
460c0217 BUT THE TERMINAL FACILITIES WERE CLOSED SO MR. BARRETT AND FIVE OTHER PASSENGERS HAD TO SCALE A WIRE FENCE TO GET OUT
460c0218 A NEARBY HOTEL PICKED THEM UP AND CHARGED THEM EIGHTEEN DOLLARS AND SEVENTY FIVE CENTS EACH FOR THE VAN RIDE
460c0219 NACCO MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT A FRAGMENTED PORTABLE APPLIANCE INDUSTRY IS UNDERGOING A CONSOLIDATION AND NACCO WANTS TO BE A PLAYER IN THAT PROCESS MR. SMITH SAID
460c021a WE WOULDN'T HAVE ACQUIRED WEAREVER PROCTORSILEX IF THERE WEREN'T AN OPPORTUNITY TO ADD TO IT HE SAID
460c021b ELECTRIC APPLIANCES ARE THE LARGEST PART OF THAT BUSINESS HE SAID
460c021c <NOISE> TODAY THE MUTUAL FUND INDUSTRY IS ON THE ROPES WITH SALES PLUMMETING NINETY SEVEN PERCENT IN A SINGLE YEAR
460c021d THIS ILLUSTRATES THE SAD TRUTH THAT THINGS CAN CHANGE OVERNIGHT IN THE STOCK MARKET
460c021e LIKE SAY THE NIGHT OF OCTOBER EIGHTEENTH NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
460c0301 LAST YEAR SPONSORS OF A STRONG ACID RAIN BILL CLAIMED TO HAVE A TENTATIVE ONE VOTE MAJORITY ON THE COMMITTEE IN FAVOR OF THEIR BILL
460c0302 THE MEASURE WAS CO SPONSORED BY ONE THIRD OF THE HOUSE AND SUPPORT APPEARED TO BE GROWING
460c0303 REPRESENTATIVE DINGELL WHOSE DISTRICT'S STEEL AND AUTO INDUSTRIES OPPOSED THE BILL BOTTLED IT UP IN THE COMMITTEE
460c0304 <NOISE> GORBACHEV DISCUSSED ARMS CONTROL ISSUES WITH OTHER WARSAW PACT LEADERS IN EAST BERLIN
460c0305 WHILE DETAILS WEREN'T DISCLOSED SOVIET OFFICIALS INDICATED THAT THERE WOULD BE NO UNILATERAL WITHDRAWAL OF SOVIET TROOPS FROM EASTERN EUROPE
460c0306 SPOKESMEN SAID THERE WOULD BE NO REPORT ON THE CONFERENCE BEFORE ITS CONCLUSION SCHEDULED FOR TODAY
460c0307 THE SALE ALSO PROVIDES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WITH CASH AS IT TRIES TO NARROW THE BUDGET DEFICIT
460c0308 AFTER SUBTRACTING UNDERWRITERS' FEES OF ABOUT SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS THE GOVERNMENT'S NET PROCEEDS FROM THE OFFERING ARE ONE POINT FIVE EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS
460c0309 IN ADDITION THE GOVERNMENT HAS ALREADY BEEN PAID THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FROM CONRAIL'S CASH RESERVES UNDER PROVISIONS OF THE PUBLIC OFFERING
460c030a BUT THE INCIDENT WASN'T REPORTED
460c030b AS MR. MCGOWAN REMEMBERS IT THE UNITED CAPTAIN WHO NORMALLY FILES SUCH REPORTS SIMPLY SAID LET'S FORGET ABOUT IT
460c030c IT'S NOT WORTH THE TROUBLE
460c030d MR. KAPLAN JOINED *MACMILLAN* IN NINETEEN SIXTY WHEN A COMPANY HE CO FOUNDED THE FREE PRESS WAS SOLD TO THE PUBLISHER
460c030e HE BECAME PRESIDENT OF MACMILLAN PUBLISHING IN NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE AND WAS NAMED MANAGING DIRECTOR OF THE COMPANY'S BRITISH SUBSIDIARY IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR
460c030f HE REASSUMED THE POST OF PRESIDENT IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN AND WAS APPOINTED CHAIRMAN IN NINETEEN EIGHTY
460c030g <NOISE> SECURITIES ANALYSTS HOWEVER REMAIN CONCERNED ABOUT BASIC LOAN DEMAND
460c030h BRENT ERENSEL OF DEAN WITTER REYNOLDS INCORPORATED NOTED LENDING VOLUME GENERALLY ISN'T ROBUST
460c030i MARGINS ARE DOWN BECAUSE OF THE NEW TAX LAW AND THE SUSPENSION OF INTEREST PAYMENTS IN BRAZIL
460c030j ON THE OTHER HAND HE *SAID* LOAN PORTFOLIO QUALITY IS IMPROVING AND BANKS ARE GETTING A BETTER GRIP ON CONTROLLING EXPENSES
460c030k MR. LAY SAID THE LOSSES OCCURED IN LATE SEPTEMBER AND EARLY THIS MONTH A TIME PARTICULAR VOLATILITY IN OIL MARKETS
460c030l THERE WERE TWO SENIOR PEOPLE COLLUDING AND KEEPING A SEPARATE SET OF BOOKS APART FROM THE OFFICIAL BOOKS FOR A FEW WEEKS MR. LAY SAID
460c030m THEIR GUESSES WERE WRONG ON BOTH SIDES OF THE MARKET
460c030n MR. KITAJIMA GETS EXCITED
460c030o HE PREDICTS A BIG GAIN IN THE INDEX MAYBE A THOUSAND POINTS
460c030p IT'S JUST A FEELING I HAVE HE SAYS
460c030q WORLDS OF WONDER NEEDS TO CONVINCE CREDITORS TO EXTEND IT TIME THROUGH THE CHRISTMAS SEASON WHICH IS BY FAR THE BIGGEST SALES PERIOD FOR TOY COMPANIES
460c030r IT'S IN THE CREDITORS' BEST INTEREST TO KEEP THE COMPANY GOING AT LEAST FOR NOW SAYS FRED ANSCHEL AN ANALYST WITH DEAN WITTER REYNOLDS INCORPORATED
460c030s AS OF SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH THE COMPANY'S INVENTORY WAS A HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS A SPOKESWOMAN SAID
460c030t PEOPLE THOUGHT WE'D JUST SIT BACK AND JUST ENJOY THE HOLIDAYS SAID EDWARD P. NICOSKI MARKET STRATEGIST AT PIPER JAFFRAY AND HOPWOOD INCORPORATED MINNEAPOLIS
460c030u <NOISE> BUT WE'RE SEEING SOME STRONG BUYING HERE
460c030v WE'RE SEEING A WHOLE BUNCH OF STOCKS BREAKING OUT OF THEIR TRADING RANGES
460c030w IN AN AWKWARD REMINDER OF THE BOOM DAYS SHEARSON'S NEW LONDON HEADQUARTERS FACES AN ICE SKATING RINK BUILT JUST TO GIVE THE COMPLEX MORE GRANDEUR
460c030x OUTDOOR ORGAN MUSIC BLARES LAWRENCE WELK TUNES ONE DAY AS TWO BOYS SKATE ALONE ON THE ICE WITH HOCKEY STICKS
460c030y IT LOOKS NICE DOESN'T IT A SHEARSON OFFICIAL BITTERLY REMARKS
460c030z UNDERNEATH THE SKATING RINK IS A GYMNASIUM SHEARSON IS TRYING TO SELL
460c0310 MR. LICHTEN DIDN'T RETURN PHONE CALLS SEEKING COMMENT
460c0311 HOWEVER BANK EXECUTIVES SPECULATE THAT HIS DEPARTURE WAS LINKED TO CHASE'S MERGER LAST DECEMBER OF ITS INVESTMENT BANKING AND COMMERCIAL BANKING FUNCTIONS
460c0312 FOLLOWING THE REORGANIZATION MR. LICHTEN BECAME EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT FOR TAX RELATED FINANCINGS AND FOREIGN CORPORATE CLIENTS
460c0313 THE FED'S POSTURE THROUGH ALL OF THIS IS REMARKABLY SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE WILLIAM MCCHESNEY MARTIN FED OF THE MID NINETEEN FIFTIES
460c0314 <NOISE> THERE WAS NEVER ANY QUESTION ABOUT MR. MARTIN'S PRIORITIES HE WAS FIRST OF ALL AN INFLATION FIGHTER AND THAT WAS CERTAINLY TO THE GOOD
460c0315 BUT NO ONE WAS EVER SURE JUST HOW THE FED WOULD WAGE ITS INFLATION BATTLES
460c0316 MR. MARTIN INDICATED HE WOULD LEAN AGAINST THE WIND WHEN HE SENSED INFLATION COMING AND IT DID
460c0317 HE GOT RID OF THE INFLATION SURGE THAT BEGAN IN NINETEEN FIFTY SIX BUT IT TOOK THE DEEP NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN FIFTY EIGHT RECESSION TO DO SO
460c0318 <NOISE> THIS IS THE POOREST LAND IN THE WEST BESET BY CORRUPTION ILLITERACY DISEASE AND A HISTORY OF GOVERNMENTS THAT SEEMINGLY HAVE MADE THOSE CONDITIONS POLICY GOALS
460c0319 <NOISE> HAITI'S PROBLEMS AND PECULIARITIES NOW SEEM TO B- SO TOWERING THAT THE LATEST POLITICAL TWISTS PROBABLY WON'T MEAN MUCH
460c031a WESTERN NOTIONS OF PROGRESS AND DEVELOPMENT FADE IN THE SMOKE OF A VOODOO PRIEST'S FLAMING MAGIC STONES
460c031b SCHERING PLOUGH SAID GRUPO ACHE HAS AN OPTION TO BUY THE REST
460c031c THE BRAZILIAN OPERATIONS BASED IN RIO DE JANEIRO INCLUDE A PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURING PLANT AND OFFICES THAT EMPLOY ABOUT NINE HUNDRED PEOPLE
460c031d SCHERING PLOUGH SAID GRUPO ACHE WOULD INSTALL ITS OWN MANAGEMENT
460c031e <NOISE> THE BRAZILIAN FACILITY HAD NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT SALES OF SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS
460c0401 CITICORP ATTRIBUTED THE DISSOLUTION OF THE PROJECT WHICH FOCUSED ON OIL AND *PETROCHEMICALS* TO THE SHARP DECLINE OF OIL PRICES IN THE PAST YEAR
460c0402 A CITICORP SPOKESMAN SAID CURTAILMENTS IN TRADING OPERATIONS AT MAJOR OIL COMPANIES AND THE DROP OF THE DOLLAR VOLUME OF OIL TRADING HURT THE DEMAND FOR THE SERVICE
460c0403 GEMCO HAD HOPED EVENTUALLY TO EXPAND THE BUSINESS TO INCLUDE OTHER COMMODITIES BUT THOSE PLANS HAVE BEEN DROPPED
460c0404 UNDER THE PLAN EXISTING HOLDERS WHO OWNED THREE POINT THREE MILLION COMMON SHARES WILL OWN ABOUT NINETY PERCENT OF THE COMMON IN THE REORGANIZED COMPANY
460c0405 THE PLAN CALLS FOR MR. WILLIAMS TO RECEIVE A BONUS OF A HUNDRED THOUSAND SHARES AND OPTIONS TO BUY ANOTHER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND SHARES OVER A FOUR YEAR PERIOD
460c0406 SOME SHARES WILL BE RESERVED FOR OTHER SALANT OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES
460c0407 IF ALL OPTIONS WERE EXERCISED MR. WILLIAMS WOULD HOLD NINE POINT FOUR TWO PERCENT INTEREST IN THE COMPANY
460c0408 THEY ARE FIRMLY BASED ON THREE PRINCIPLES
460c0409 <NOISE> THE FIRST IS THAT TRUST AND FREEDOM SHOULD TAKE PRECEDENCE OVER REGULATION AND *BUREAUCRATIC* CONTROL
460c040a IF PEOPLE AT EVERY LEVEL OF SOCIETY ARE DEPRIVED OF THE AUTHORITY CO- COMMENSURATE WITH THEIR DUTIES THEY QUICKLY LOSE THEIR MOTIVATION AND THEIR SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY
460c040b TO CHANGE SUCH THINKING FORD HAS RECENTLY BEGUN CIRCULATING NEW SALARY GUIDELINES
460c040c WE WON'T EVEN LOOK AT THE STAFF IN CONSIDERING SALARIES SAYS MR. HAUSMAN
460c040d THE AUTO MAKER HAS ALSO DONE AWAY WITH COST OF LIVING AND GENERAL SALARY INCREASES IN FAVOR OF MERIT RAISES TO PROMOTE PRODUCTIVITY
460c040e FUJITSU LIMITED'S THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF FIVE YEAR EUROBONDS WITH THE SAME BASIC TERMS CLOSED AT NINETY EIGHT TO NINETY NINE
460c040f THE JAPANESE ELECTRONICS CONCERN IS AFFECTED BY THE U. S.'S NEWLY IMPOSED DUTIES ON CERTAIN PRODUCTS ACCORDING TO AN OFFICIAL AT NIKKO SECURITIES COMPANY WHICH LED THE ISSUE
460c040g BUT IT ISN'T CLEAR HOW LARGE THE IMPACT WILL BE
460c040h A CONRAIL ENGINEER WAS INDICTED ON CHARGES OF MANSLAUGHTER IN CONNECTION WITH THE JANUARY FOURTH COLLISION OF THREE LOCOMOTIVES WITH AN AMTRAK PASSENGER TRAIN IN MARYLAND
460c040i SIXTEEN PEOPLE WERE KILLED AND ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE INJURED IN THE CRASH
460c040j A GRAND JURY FOUND THAT THE ENGINEER HAD OPERATED THE LOCOMOTIVES IN A GROSSLY NEG- NEGLIGENT MANNER
460c040k <NOISE> POLAROID STILL MUST REFINE THESE TECHNOLOGIES BEFORE THEY CAN BE USED IN MAJOR CONSUMER SYSTEMS
460c040l INITIAL HIGH PRICED COMMERCIAL SYSTEMS USING THE TECHNOLOGIES MUST BE AVAILABLE BY NINETEEN NINETY BUT CONSUMER SYSTEMS WILL TAKE LONGER
460c040m MOREOVER ANY NEW SYSTEM THAT POLAROID BRINGS TO MARKET ISN'T GUARANTEED SUCCESS BECAUSE OTHER CAMERA COMPANIES ARE WORKING ON ELECTRONIC IMAGING SYSTEMS AS WELL
460c040n ISRAEL'S SHAMIR HOPES TO AVOID LOOKING LIKE THE SPOILER OF PEACE PROSPECTS BY FLOATING A REGIONAL PEACE CONFERENCE PLAN INVOLVING ONLY ISRAEL AND ARAB STATES
460c040o HE BILLS IT AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO RIVAL PERES'S PLANS FOR AN INTERNATIONAL MEETING LEADING TO ISRAEL JORDAN TALKS
460c040p BUT JORDAN AND THE PALESTINIANS BOTH FIND SHAMIR'S PLAN UNACCEPTABLE
460c040q SECOND THERE WAS MR. KINNOCK HIMSELF
460c040r <NOISE> HIS STRATEGIES AND POLL TAKERS HAVE LONG KNOWN THAT MOST BRITISH VOTERS ONLY HAVE A FUZZY IDEA OF WHAT KIND OF MAN HE IS
460c040s PART OF HIS PROBLEM WAS MRS. THATCHER WHOSE POWERFUL PERSONALITY HAS DOMINATED THE STAGE FOR ALMOST A DECADE
460c040t PEOPLE GENERALLY RESPECT MRS. THATCHER BUT NOT MANY REALLY LIKE HER
460c040u THE COMPANY ATTRIBUTED THE EARNINGS INCREASE TO GROWING POPULARITY OF ITS THREE PLUS NETWORK OPERATING SYSTEM WHICH IS USED WITH INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINE CORP.'S PERSONAL COMPUTERS AND COMPATIBLE MODELS
460c040v THE COMPANY ALSO SAID INITIAL ORDERS FOR ITS THREE PLUS NETWORK OPERATING SYSTEM FOR APPLE COMPUTER INCORPORATED MACINTOSH HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY ENCOURAGING
460c040w THE SYSTEM FOR THE MACINTOSH WAS INTRODUCED IN AUGUST
460c040x THE PROMOTIONS WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT MR. RICE PREDICTS
460c040y THE DISCOUNTING IS LIKELY TO BE PARTICULARLY SHARP THIS MONTH AND NEXT A PERIOD DUBBED DEATH VALLEY DAYS IN THE BUSINESS BECAUSE SALES ARE USUALLY SO SLOW
460c040z DOMINO'S THIS MONTH BEGAN ITS FIRST NATIONAL AD CAMPAIGN FOR A TWO FOR ONE OFFER
460c0410 MANY PEOPLE MAY HAVE BEEN HIGHLY SURPRISED BY MR. JACKSON'S HISTORIC VICTORIES ON SUPER TUESDAY
460c0411 THOUGH MANY POLLS ACCURATELY RECORDED HIS GROWING STRENGTH THE NEWS STORIES ACCOMPANYING THESE POLLS HAD THE USUAL IMMENSE DIFFICULTY IN MENTIONING THE DIFFICULT NAME OF JACKSON
460c0412 THIS WAS TRUE IN THE CASE OF THE NEW YORK TIMES AND THE WASHINGTON POST
460c0413 SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH OLDER OR LARGER BUSINESSES THINK GEORGE BUSH'S POLICY WOULD BE THE MOST FAVORABLE FOR SMALL BUSINESS
460c0414 BUT THE VICE PRESIDENT HARDLY WON A RINGING ENDORSEMENT HE RATED ONLY FIVE POINT EIGHT ON A SCALE OF TEN
460c0415 AND AMONG WOMEN BUSINESS OWNERS MR. BUSH HAD ONLY A FOUR POINT EIGHT RATING
460c0416 KODAK MAKES A BILLION POUNDS ANNUALLY MOSTLY FOR ITSELF
460c0417 IT SELLS ABOUT TWO MILLION POUNDS TO SIX U. S. DISTRIBUTORS WHO RESELL TO OTHERS
460c0418 KODAK KNOWS THE IDENTITY OF THE END USERS OF ONE MILLION POUNDS BUT CAN'T ACCOUNT FOR THE REST
460c0419 HOECHST CELANESE SELLS ACETIC ANHYDRIDE TO DOZENS OF DISTRIBUTORS A SPOKESMAN SAYS
460c041a IN SOME INSTANCES WE KNOW WHO THE DISTRIBUTOR SELLS TO THE SPOKESMAN SAYS
460c041b IN SOME CASES WE DON'T
460c041c AS BRITAIN'S FLAG CARRIER THE AIRLINE INHERITED A VAST ROUTE NETWORK
460c041d BRITISH CALEDONIAN BROUGHT ROUTES TO THE SOUTHERN U. S. THE MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA AS WELL AS LUCRATIVE FLIGHTS TO EAST ASIA
460c041e BRITISH AIRWAYS GAVE UP ONLY A FEW ROUTES FROM GATWICK TO EUROPEAN CITIES WHICH IN MOST CASES IS ALREADY SERVED FROM HEATHROW
460c041f TRADERS SAID INVESTORS APPARENTLY WERE SKITTISH ABOUT BUYING THE KROGER PREFERRED AFTER THE COMPANY'S ANNOUNCEMENTS TO RESTRUCTURE
460c041g TRADERS SAID THE COMPANY WILL NOW PAY ITS DUTCH AUCTION PREFERRED HOLDERS EIGHT POINT NINE ONE PERCENT OVER THE NEXT FORTY NINE DAYS UNTIL THE NEXT REGULARLY SCHEDULED AUCTION
460c041h THAT RATE IS MORE THAN TWO PERCENTAGE POINTS OVER PREFERRED DIVIDENDS BY SIMILAR SINGLE A. RATED COMPANIES
461c0201 LAST WEEK THERE WERE REPORTS THAT AFTER THE OFFERING SHEARSON LEHMAN HAD A BIG UNSOLD CHUNK OF STOCK
461c0202 IN A NARROWLY DRAWN STATEMENT VICE CHAIRMAN HERBERT FREIMAN DENIED SHEARSON HAD OFFERED A BLOCK TO SALOMON BROTHERS WHICH MANAGED THE SELLING BROKERS' FLOOR OPERATION
461c0203 MR. FREIMAN WOULDN'T ELABORATE
461c0204 CHICAGO MAGAZINE HAS ANNUAL REVENUE OF ABOUT THIRTEEN MILLION DOLLARS AND IS OPERATING AT ABOUT BREAK EVEN METROPOLITAN DETROIT OFFICIALS SAID
461c0205 BUT THEY SAID THEY EXPECT TO TRIM COSTS BY COMBINING BOTH MAGAZINES' PAPER AND PRINTING EXPENSES
461c0206 CHICAGO MAGAZINE STILL HASN'T HIT ITS STRIDE SAID TOM JONES PUBLISHER AND EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT OF METROPOLITAN DETROIT
461c0207 THERE'S TREMENDOUS ROOM TO GROW IN TERMS OF AD PAGES
461c0208 CONTRA LEADERS SAY THEY LOOK FORWARD TO THE MILITARY CHALLENGE
461c0209 IT'S IN OUR BALLPARK SAYS CARLOS ULVERT THE CONTRA FOREIGN SECRETARY
461c020a HE AND OTHER CONTRAS ASSERT THAT CONGRESSIONAL STINGINESS UNTIL THIS YEAR KEPT THE CONTRAS FROM PICKING UP STEAM ON THE BATTLEFIELD
461c020b <NOISE> MR. ULVERT ADDS IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TEN THOUSAND MEN IN NICARAGUA BETTER TRAINED AND BETTER SUPPLIED THEIR MILITARY PRESENCE IS GOING TO BE FELT
461c020c THAT LINE MAY BE WEARING THIN WITH PRIVATE BANKS
461c020d THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE EVIDENCE OF SOUND POLICY MOVES
461c020e OTHERWISE WHY KEEP POURING GOOD MONEY AFTER BAD
461c020f AT W. F. I. A. RUNNING THE FORMULA LAST JANUARY THIRTIETH MEANT BUYING MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND SHARES OF REEBOK QUICKLY
461c020g THAT'S BECAUSE W. F. I. A. LIKES TO OWN ALL THE STOCKS IN THE S. AND P. FIVE HUNDRED INDEX IN AMOUNTS SCALED TO THEIR MARKET WEIGHT
461c020h THOSE HOLDINGS RANGE FROM MORE THAN ONE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS OF I. B. M. TO JUST SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS OF ALLIS CHALMERS CORPORATION
461c020i HIS FIRST TEST ON THAT ISSUE WILL BE WHETHER HE CAN PERSUADE THE OPPOSITION TO FIELD A CANDIDATE AGAINST HIM
461c020j THE CHIEF OPPOSITION PARTY THE REUNIFICATION AND DEMOCRACY PARTY LED BY KIM YOUNG SAM HAS VOWED IT WON'T PARTICIPATE IN ANY ELECTION UNDER THE CURRENT CONSTITUTION
461c020k IT AND THE NATIONAL COALITION FOR A DEMOCRATIC CONSTITUTION A NEWLY FORMED ALLIANCE OF RELIGIOUS AND DISSIDENT GROUPS ARE ORGANIZING TOMORROW'S OPPOSITION RALLIES
461c020l SOUNDS GOOD BUT WHAT'S THE CATCH
461c020m MR. LEMING A CHEMICALS ANALYST ISSUED HIS REPORT JUNE TWENTY SECOND WITH SEAGRAM TRADING AT SEVENTY SEVEN
461c020n IT CLOSED YESTERDAY AT SEVENTY SIX AND THREE EIGHTHS UP ONE AND SEVEN EIGHTHS
461c020o THIS REASONING HAS CLEARLY FAILED TO GALVANIZE THE MARKET
461c020p MR. LEMING DIDN'T RETURN CALLS SEEKING COMMENT YESTERDAY
461c020q GEMFIBROZIL HAS LONG BEEN KNOWN TO INCREASE H. D. L. BUT UNTIL THIS REPORT ITS EFFECT ON HEART DISEASE WAS UNCLEAR
461c020r AVAILABLE IN THE U. S. SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO GEMFIBROZIL GAINED ONLY LIMITED USE
461c020s THAT IS BECAUSE GEMFIBROZIL ONLY MODERATELY REDUCES L. D. L. COMPARED WITH OTHER DRUGS
461c020t THE ROLLBACKS COULD BE UNEXPECTEDLY PAINFUL FOR SOME HOURLY WORKERS
461c020u CHRYSLER'S UNEMPLOYMENT FUND HAS BEEN DRAINED TO THE POINT THAT BENEFITS ARE ALREADY BEING REDUCED A U. A. W. SPOKESMAN SAID
461c020v THE FUND HAS AT LEAST IN PART BEEN DRAINED BY WORKERS TEMPORARILY LAID OFF WHEN PLANTS WERE CLOSED DOWN FOR RETOOLING
461c020w THE WINNER IN THE GENERAL ELECTION USED SOME CREATIVE METHODS TOO
461c020x RONALD REAGAN'S CAMPAIGN REGISTERED VOTERS FOR THE GENERAL ELECTION CAMPAIGN USING TWO MILLION DOLLARS CHARGED TO HIS UNCONTESTED RENOMINATION
461c020y THE STAFF OF THE ELECTION COMMISSION CHALLENGED THAT AND RECOMMENDED THAT SEVEN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS IN FEDERAL SUBSIDIES BE REPAID TO THE TREASURY
461c020z BUT THE AUDITORS WERE OVERRULED BY A FOUR TO ONE VOTE OF THE COMMISSION IN WHICH ALL REPUBLICAN MEMBERS SIDED WITH THE PRESIDENT
461c0210 AS SOON AS TWO MONTHS FROM NOW ARGENTINE COURTS ARE DUE TO TRY THE LAST GROUPS OF GENERALS STILL SUBJECT TO PROSECUTION FOR ALLEGED HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES
461c0211 THE PROCEEDINGS ARE THE LAST CHANCE TO BRING MILITARY MEN TO CIVILIAN JUSTICE
461c0212 SO FAR IN FOUR YEARS OF CIVILIAN GOVERNMENT SEVEN TOP MILITARY OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN CONVICTED
461c0213 CHARGES WERE BROUGHT AGAINST HUNDREDS OF OTHERS BUT PROSECUTIONS WERE HALTED LAST YEAR IN THE FACE OF ARMY RESTIVENESS
461c0214 THE ARGUMENT WAS THAT THE ACCUSED OFFICERS HAD ONLY BEEN ACTING UNDER ORDERS
461c0215 KAISER'S PRESENT VALUE IS EQUALLY UNCERTAIN THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT ITS NET WORTH IS AT LEAST A NEGATIVE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS
461c0216 IN ITS LAWSUITS AGAINST FORMER MANAGEMENT THE COMPANY IS SEEKING DAMAGES OF MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR ALLEGED SELF DEALING AND MISMANAGEMENT
461c0217 <NOISE> IN THE PROCESS THE SUITS ALLEGE ASSETS WERE OVERSTATED AND LIABILITIES UNDERSTATED
461c0218 REMEMBER THE ONE ABOUT THE INVESTMENT BANKER
461c0219 IT WAS WIDELY TOLD CIRCA OCTOBER NINETEENTH NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN AND WENT LIKE THIS WHAT DO YOU CALL AN INVESTMENT BANKER
461c021a HEY WAITER
461c021b NOW STUNG BY THE RECENT DEBT LADEN TAKEOVERS SOME FUND MANAGERS ARE PLANNING TO DUMP INDUSTRIAL BONDS
461c021c OTHERS WILL REDUCE THEIR EXPOSURE TO THEM
461c021d WHAT MEN ARE BUYING INSTEAD BONDS ISSUED BY UTILITIES BANKS AND FOREIGN COMPANIES THOSE WITH THE LEAST CHANCE OF BEING BOUGHT OUT
461c021e OTHERS ARE BUYING SAFER TREASURY BONDS WHOSE YIELDS ARE A PERCENTAGE OR LESS BELOW TOP GRADE INDUSTRIAL DEBT
461c0301 ALONG WITH THAT SURGE HAS COME AN EXPLOSION OF ANOTHER SORT
461c0302 THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS AND INQUIRIES WE'RE GETTING IS ENORMOUS SAYS CECELIA CHARLES ACTING DIRECTOR OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS FOR THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
461c0303 THEY'RE INCREASING BETWEEN FIVE PERCENT AND TEN PERCENT A YEAR
461c0304 THERE WILL BE ABOUT THIRTY SIX THOUSAND OF THEM THIS YEAR
461c0305 DELTA IS EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE THAT IT WILL BECOME THE NEW OFFICIAL CARRIER FOR WALT DISNEY WORLD IN ORLANDO FLORIDA
461c0306 THE AIRLINE IS CALLING TODAY'S ANNOUNCEMENT THE MOST IMPORTANT MARKETING ENDEAVOR IN DELTA'S RECENT HISTORY
461c0307 FOR RIVAL EASTERN AIRLINES A UNIT OF TEXAS AIR CORPORATION IT MAY BE YET ANOTHER LOSS OF PRESTIGE
461c0308 UNDER THE PLAN EXISTING HOLDERS WHO OWNED THREE POINT THREE MILLION COMMON SHARES WILL OWN ABOUT NINETY PERCENT OF THE COMMON IN THE REORGANIZED COMPANY
461c0309 THE PLAN CALLS FOR MR. WILLIAMS TO RECEIVE A BONUS ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND SHARES AND OPTIONS TO BUY ANOTHER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND SHARES OVER A FOUR YEAR PERIOD
461c030a SOME SHARES WILL BE RESERVED FOR OTHER SALANT OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES
461c030b IF ALL OPTIONS WERE EXERCISED MR. WILLIAMS WOULD HOLD A NINE POINT FOUR TWO PERCENT INTEREST IN THE COMPANY
461c030c I THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT
461c030d HAVE YOU GIVEN ANY SERIOUS THOUGHT TO DIVERSIFYING
461c030e MAYBE YOU SHOULD HAVE A VARIETY OF HOLDINGS IN YOUR PORTFOLIO
461c030f OR PERHAPS YOU SHOULD LIMIT YOUR EXPOSURE BY HEDGING
461c030g YOU COULD MAKE A PLAY ON BOTH SIDES OF THIS DEAL I SUGGESTED EARNESTLY
461c030h ALSO PROVIDING SOME SOLACE FOR MUNICIPAL BOND PROFESSIONALS IS THE FACT THAT COMMERCIAL BANKS ARE BECOMING MORE ACTIVE AS UNDERWRITERS RATHER THAN AS INVESTORS
461c030i THIS MEANS THEY WILL NEED TO HIRE MORE INVESTMENT BANKERS
461c030j THE BANKS' MOVE IS PART OF THEIR EFFORT TO TEST AND EXPAND THE LIMITS OF SECURITIES AND BANKING LAWS
461c030k I. R. E. HAS DOWNSIZED ITS REAL ESTATE SYNDICATION BUSINESS AND IS PRIMARILY A SAVINGS AND LOAN HOLDING COMPANY MR. LEVAN SAID
461c030l EARNINGS IN THE PAST WERE SOMEWHAT ERRATIC QUARTER TO QUARTER BECAUSE THE MAJOR BUSINESS WAS REAL ESTATE SYNDICATION
461c030m NOW THE S. AND L. HOLDING COMPANY IS THE MAIN BUSINESS WITH DOWN SIZED REAL ESTATE SYNDICATION
461c030n CORE EARNINGS ARE VERY CONSISTENT
461c030o WE NEED A NEW NATIONAL POLICY ON THE ROLE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SHOULD PLAY IN OUR SOCIETY
461c030p OUR CURRENT POLICY IS STILL BASED ON THE COMMUNICATIONS ACT OF NINETEEN THIRTY FOUR FRAMED WHEN THE ELECTRONIC COMPUTER WAS STILL A DREAM
461c030q THE ACT PROVIDED THE IMPETUS FOR ACHIEVING THE OVERRIDING TELECOMMUNICATIONS OBJECTIVE OF THAT TIME UNIVERSAL SERVICE
461c030r BUT THIS OBJECTIVE HAS FOR ALL PRACTICAL PURPOSES BEEN FULFILLED
461c030s WITH NO NEW OBJECTIVE TO FOCUS ON POLICY HAS DRIFTED WITH EACH REGULATORY BODY DEFENDING THE INTERESTS OF ITS OWN CONSTITUENCY

461c040j THE COURT RULED THAT THE CONSTITUTION ISN'T VIOLATED BY EXEMPTING SUCH GROUPS FROM THE FEDERAL LAW THAT BARS BIAS IN EMPLOYMENT BASED ON RELIGION
461c040k THE DECISION GIVES RELIGIOUS GROUPS THE FLEXIBILITY TO ESTABLISH THEIR OWN HIRING CRITERIA
461c040l IN AN INTERVIEW MR. EXLEY SAID DEMAND IS STRONG BOTH IN THE U. S. AND IN MAJOR FOREIGN MARKETS WITH PERSONAL COMPUTERS LEADING THE WAY
461c040m ALSO THE COMPANY WHICH OBTAINED ABOUT FIFTY FOUR PERCENT OF REVENUE FROM ABROAD LAST YEAR CONTINUES TO BENEFIT FROM THE WEAKER DOLLAR
461c040n IN ADDITION N. C. R. IS REPURCHASING ITS OWN SHARES IN THE OPEN MARKET MR. EXLEY SAID
461c040o I HAVE NO DOUBT THOUGH THAT THE THRUST OF FED POLICY WILL BE MORE TOWARD EASE THAN RESTRAINT MR. ROBERTSON ADDS
461c040p FED OFFICIALS WILL BE MUCH MORE INCLINED TO ERR ON THE SIDE OF EASE
461c040q SO I THINK THE FED FUNDS RATE WILL BE AT SIX POINT FIVE PERCENT TO SIX POINT SEVEN FIVE PERCENT FOR THE NEXT SIXTY DAYS
461c040r THE HONDURAN LEGISLATOR AGAIN I'M ALMOST CONVINCED THAT THE SANDINISTAS ARE GOING TO BE THERE FOREVER
461c040s I THINK WE SHOULD GO INTO A PEACE PROCESS WITH THEM

461c0416 THIS PLAN DUBBED THE MIYAZAWA PLAN IN HONOR OF JAPANESE FINANCE MINISTER KIICHI MIYAZAWA SOUNDS JOLLY ON THE SURFACE
461c0417 BANKS WOULD HAVE A NEW MARKET AT THE I. M. F. WHERE THEY COULD PEDDLE UNWANTED DEBTOR NATION PAPER
461c0418 THE DEBTOR NATIONS WOULD HAVE A NEW SOURCE OF FINANCING OF SORTS
461c0419 THEY COULD RESCHEDULE A PORTION OF THEIR DEBTS WITH A POSSIBILITY UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES OF REPAYING SOME IN THEIR OWN CURRENCIES
461c041a THE I. M. F. WOULD HAVE A MORE CENTRAL ROLE IN THE MANAGEMENT OF INTERNATIONAL DEBT
461c041b AND THE JAPANESE WOULD BECOME CLOSE PARTNERS OF THE I. M. F. IN DEBT MANAGEMENT
462c0201 SURGING STOCK PRICES IN NEW YORK AND TOKYO AND THE PROSPECT OF LOWER WORLD WIDE INTEREST RATES FUELED THE LONDON RALLY DEALERS SAID

462c0216 THE CRACK WAS DISCOVERED OCTOBER FIFTH WHEN PAINT WAS STRIPPED FOR REPAINTING
462c0217 INVESTIGATORS HAVEN'T DETERMINED THE CAUSE BUT ONE THEORY IS THAT THE PLANE HAD BEEN IMPROPERLY REPAIRED BEFORE IT WAS BOUGHT BY CONTINENTAL A UNIT OF TEXAS AIR CORPORATION
462c0218 TO BEGIN WITH COMPANIES HAVE BEEN DOING A GOOD JOB OF MANAGING INVENTORIES
462c0219 IN THE PAST BUSINESSES HAVE TENDED TO BECOME INCREASINGLY OPTIMISTIC AS EXPANSIONS PERSISTED
462c021a WHEN SALES EVENTUALLY SLOWED INVENTORIES QUICKLY REACHED EXCESSIVE LEVELS
462c021b COMPANIES THEREUPON CUT THEIR BUYING INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION DECLINED AND A RECESSION WAS UNDER WAY

462c021d THEY ARGUE THAT A COMMERCIAL MINE MIGHT GET PLAYED OUT IN A FEW YEARS
462c021e AND THEY FEAR THAT MANY TOURISTS WHO TREK HERE FOR THE TANTALIZING PROSPECT OF FINDING A DIAMOND IN THE FIELD WILL TAKE THEIR VACATIONS ELSEWHERE

463c0316 BUT IT MISTAKENLY GRABS PROTEIN A. INSTEAD OF PLASMINOGEN PULLING IT WITH ITS BAG OF FAT AND CHOLESTEROL INTO THE ARTERY WALL
463c0317 THIS THWARTS THE REPAIR PROCESS AND BEGINS A VICIOUS CYCLE DRAWING MORE AND MORE CHOLESTEROL INTO THE DAMAGED AREA

463c0319 MANY TRADERS ASSUME THE FINANCING WILL CONSIST OF THREE YEAR NOTES TEN YEAR NOTES AND THIRTY YEAR BONDS
463c031a BUT SOME TRADERS SAY THEY AREN'T SO SURE THERE WILL BE ANY THIRTY YEAR BONDS
463c031b THE REASON PRESIDENT REAGAN HASN'T YET SIGNED A TAX BILL WITH A PROVISION THAT WOULD INCREASE THE GOVERMENT'S LONG TERM BOND ISSUANCE AUTHORITY

463c0402 SOME ADMINISTRATION AND CONGRESSIONAL AIDES THINK CONGRESS WILL GO ALONG WITH SELLING THE PETROLEUM RESERVE THIS YEAR
463c0403 BUT RESISTANCE TO THE BONNEVILLE IDEA WAS SO STRONG THAT LAWMAKERS PASSED A RESOLUTION PROHIBITING THE ADMINISTRATION FROM SPENDING ANY FEDERAL MONEY TO STUDY IT

464c0310 <NOISE> MR. LETTERMAN THE SARDONIC TALK SHOW HOST SAID IN A STATEMENT HE HOPES TO REACH A SEPARATE CONTRACT AGREEMENT WITH THE WRITERS GUILD OF AMERICA
464c0311 THE UNION IS TO VOTE TODAY ON WHETHER TO APPROVE A NUMBER OF SEPARATE AGREEMENTS WITH INDEPENDENT PRODUCERS ALTHOUGH A SPOKESMAN SAID THE LETTERMAN SHOW ISN'T ONE OF THEM
464c0312 F. P. L. SAID THE ACQUISITION WOULD BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS A POOLING OF INTERESTS
464c0313 TURNER OWNS ABOUT TWELVE THOUSAND ACRES IN SOUTHWEST FLORIDA TEN THOUSAND OF WHICH ARE CITRUS GROVES

464c0317 AFTER OPENING BROADLY HIGHER THE TIDE TURNED AT MIDDAY WHEN THE DOLLAR'S SLIDE TO A THREE YEAR LOW BEGAN TO WORRY MARKET PARTICIPANTS
464c0318 <NOISE> THAT FIGHT WHILE REMARKABLE FOR ITS BITTERNESS TYPIFIES THE CORE PROBLEM IN THE NATIONWIDE PUSH TO CONTAIN MEDICAL COSTS WHO GETS LESS
464c0319 DOCTORS WANT TO MAINTAIN THEIR AUTHORITY AND THEIR INCOMES
464c031a HOSPITALS ARE FIGHTING TO HANG ONTO REVENUE MORE THAN A THIRD OF WHICH COMES FROM MEDICARE
464c031b <NOISE> AND PATIENTS DON'T WANT TO SEE SERVICES DECREASE
464c031c BUT THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM NOW CONSUMES ABOUT ONE MILLION DOLLARS A MINUTE AND ALL AGREE IT NEEDS TAMING
464c031d THEN IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR NATIONAL UNION JOINED THE MARKET
464c031e ITS POLICY FOR STATE JUDGES THE BIGGEST CLIENTS COSTS EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR FOR A ONE MILLION DOLLAR POLICY WITH NO DEDUCTIBLE
464c031f <NOISE> THE JUDGES ARE COVERED FOR ACTS ERRORS OR OMISSIONS IN THE PERFORMANCE OF PROFESSIONAL DUTIES MR. BOLEN SAYS
464c0401 A YEAR EARLIER G. M. HUGHES HAD FIRST QUARTER PROFIT OF A HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS OR SEVENTY SEVEN CENTS A SHARE
464c0402 PER SHARE EARNINGS FOR THE NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN AND NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX QUARTERS BENEFITED FROM THIRTY SEVEN POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS OF GOOD WILL AMORTIZATION IN EACH PERIOD
464c0403 THE GOOD WILL AMORTIZATION REPRESENTS THE AMOUNT ABOVE BOOK VALUE THAT G. M. PAID FOR HUGHES AIRCRAFT
464c0404 THAT ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENT REPRESENTS A CHARGE AGAINST G. M.'S EARNINGS
464c0405 BEFORE FRIDAY IT SEEMED THAT ONLY AN UNEXPECTED BREAK IN THE DELAWARE COURT CASE COULD HAVE EXTRACTED HENLEY FROM THE DILEMMA IT NOW FACES
464c0406 THUS THE CASE WAS CLOSELY WATCHED
464c0407 BUT IT ALSO RAISED IMPORTANT ISSUES OF CORPORATE LAW
464c0408 <NOISE> THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THESE WAS A CONTENTION THAT SANTA FE'S BOARD ACTED ILLEGALLY LAST DECEMBER WHEN IT LOWERED THE THRESHHOLD FOR A SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN TO TWENTY PERCENT
464c0409 PREVIOUSLY THE RIGHTS OR POISON PILL WERE TRIGGERED AUTOMATICALLY ONLY IF FIFTY PERCENT OF THE STOCK WERE IN HOSTILE HANDS
464c040a S. D. I. DESPITE WHAT THE DEFENSE LUDDITES SAY IS NOT AN ADVENTURE IN TECHNOLOGY APPLICATION
464c040b IT IS A TOOL OF NATIONAL POLICY AND AS WITH ANY TOOL IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE USED WITH A SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE IN MIND
464c040c THE OBJECTIVE LEST WE FORGET IT IS TO PREVENT A GLOBAL NUCLEAR WAR
464c040d <NOISE> HIS INABILITY TO RECOVER FROM OCTOBER'S MARKET PLUNGE WAS TRACED TO A HOSTILE BID FROM TWO RIVAL FINANCIERS FOR BELL RESOURCES LIMITED WHICH IS CONTROLLED BY BELL GROUP
464c040e THE BID FORCED MR. HOLMES A COURT TO CALL OFF A PROPOSED MERGER OF THE BELL COMPANIES
464c040f THAT WAS THE TURNING POINT SAID DARRYL SMALLEY A DIRECTOR AT THE PERTH BROKERAGE HARTLEY POYNTON LIMITED
464c040g FINALLY THERE'S THE WELFARE PROBLEM
464c040h NOT ALL WORKERS ARE AS LUCKY AS JOSEPH
464c040i SOME GET SICK OR INJURED AND LOSE THEIR JOBS
464c040j <NOISE> OTHERS WHO TURNED THEIR LIFE SAVINGS OVER TO BROKERS IN ORDER TO GET HERE DISCOVER THAT PROMISES OF MONEY MEALS AND LODGING WERE BOGUS
464c040k <NOISE> FEAR OF DEPORTATION PREVENTS THEM FROM GOING TO THE POLICE FOR HELP
464c040l <NOISE> THERE ARE UNCONFIRMED REPORTS OF WORKERS STARVING TO DEATH HERE
464c040m BUT SOME ARGUE AGENDA COULD BE A BIG HIT AND CREATE A NEW CATEGORY OF SOFTWARE
464c040n <NOISE> THIS IS FUNDAMENTALLY NEW AND DIFFERENT
464c040o <NOISE> IT'S TREMENDOUSLY EXCITING SAYS ESTHER DYSON EDITOR OF RELEASE ONE POINT OH A NEWSLETTER THAT COVERS COMPUTER SOFTWARE
464c040p I THINK IT'S AN EXTREMELY USEFUL TOOL SAYS MORT ROSENTHAL CHAIRMAN OF CORPORATE SOFTWARE INC. A WESTWOOD MASSACHUSETTS BASED SOFTWARE DISTRIBUTOR
464c040q HE SAYS HE USES AGENDA MORE THAN ANY OTHER SOFTWARE
464c040r IMPERIAL SAYS IT HAS HAD TERRIFIC UNSOLICITED INTEREST IN THE MATERIAL FROM ALL AREAS OF PLASTICS USES
464c040s BUT THE COST OF MANUFACTURING THE NATURAL PLASTIC IS PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE FIFTEEN DOLLARS A POUND COMPARED WITH ROUGHLY SIXTY FIVE CENTS A POUND FOR CONVENTIONAL PLASTIC
464c040t HOWEVER THE COMPANY SAYS IT HOPES TO REDUCE MANUFACTURING COSTS ENOUGH TO BEGIN MARKETING THE PLASTIC IN TWO TO FIVE YEARS
464c040u <NOISE> MR. *HEFTER* OF JEFFERIES SAYS INVESTORS ARE BASICALLY PICKING SOME STOCKS IN WHICH THEY HAVE SITUATIONS GOING THAT THEY HAVE A DEFINITE IDEA ABOUT
464c040v BUT IN GENERAL THE WAIT AND SEE ATTITUDE IS STILL VERY PREVALENT OUT THERE
464c040w THERE IS NO REAL PRESSURE TO JUMP INTO THE MARKET RIGHT NOW
464c040x MR. BETHELL HAS AN EYE FOR THE FASHIONABLE AND FOR THE ABOMINABLE WHICH TODAY ARE OFTEN THE SAME THING
464c040y HE OBVIOUSLY RELISHES A GOOD FIGHT AND SAYS NO TO THE CULTURAL BARBARIANS AND THE CURRENT WISDOM
464c040z <NOISE> HE USES PIG BLADDER HAMMER AND TONGS AND SCALPEL AND HE IS ADEPT WITH THEM ALL AS THE ELECTRIC WINDMILL SHOWS
464c0410 THE BIG ATTRACTION IS THAT THE NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT SUMMER OLYMPICS AREN'T REALLY BEING HELD IN THE SUMMER
464c0411 G. M. WHICH HAS LOST ABOUT EIGHT PERCENT OF THE U. S. CAR MARKET IN RECENT YEARS FIGURES THE GAMES' LATE SEPTEMBER TIMING IS IDEAL
464c0412 IT ALSO HOPES THE GAMES WILL ATTRACT UPSCALE VIEWERS WHO NORMALLY DON'T TUNE INTO SPORTS
464c0413 DURING THE CAMPAIGN AS IN EARLIER ONES A FEW LOW AND MIDDLE RANKING OFFICIALS WERE ARRESTED OR DISMISSED
464c0414 <NOISE> BUT NO LEADING CADRES OR THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS WERE PUNISHED FUELING CYNICISM AMONG THE MASSES
464c0415 AND THE CORRUPTION PROBLEM SEEMED ONLY TO GET WORSE
464c0416 GETTING THE DEAL RIGHT IS THE KEY
464c0417 UNLIKE WARRANTS ON JAPANESE STOCKS DEALS FOR U. S. COMPANIES AREN'T REALLY COVERED BY THE OWNERSHIP OF UNDERLYING SHARES
464c0418 INSTEAD UNDERWRITERS USE WHAT THEY CALL A DYNAMIC HEDGE
464c0419 <NOISE> EACH IS DIFFERENT BUT USUALLY INVOLVES A COMBINATION OF STOCK OPTION PURCHASES ARRANGED BY THE HOME OFFICE IN NEW YORK
464c041a SOME OF THAT CASH HAS BEEN USED FOR BONUS PAYMENTS
464c041b WAGES AND BONUSES ROSE NINETEEN PERCENT IN THE FIRST HALF A RATE THAT FAR OUTPACED ECONOMIC GROWTH AND EXERTED UPWARD PRESSURE ON PRICES
464c041c CHINA'S ECONOMY GREW AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF FIVE POINT SEVEN PERCENT IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS ROUGHLY HALF THE AVERAGE ANNUAL RATE IN THE PAST DECADE
465c0201 *WICKES* HAD MADE ITS FRIENDLY OFFER FOR LEAR *SIEGLER* TO HELP ITS SANTA MONICA NEIGHBOR WARD OFF A. F. G. PARTNERS' INITIAL TAKEOVER BID LAST MONTH
465c0202 BUT *WICKES* WHICH HAD SIGNED AN AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE LEAR FOR ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS BACKED OFF AFTER HAVING PROBLEMS ARRANGING FINANCING ON SATISFACTORY TERMS
465c0203 *WICKES* HAS DECLINED COMMENT SINCE SAYING THAT IT WAS OFFICIALLY CONTINUING EFFORTS TO ARRANGE FINANCING BUT WASN'T OPTIMISTIC ABOUT ITS CHANCES
465c0204 THE ADMINISTRATION HAS OCCASIONALLY MOUTHED COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE PRIVATE EXPRESS STATUTES THE LAWS THAT PROHIBIT FREE CHOICE IN MAIL SERVICE BUT HAS DONE LITTLE ASIDE FROM TALK
465c0205 THE WHITE HOUSE INTERVENED EARLIER LAST YEAR TO STOP THE POSTAL SERVICE FROM BANNING PRIVATE COMPANIES FROM SHIPPING BUNDLES OF LETTERS OVERSEAS TO BE DEPOSITED DIRECTLY IN FOREIGN MAIL SYSTEMS
465c0206 BUT THIS WAS FAIRLY MINOR
465c0207 THE GOVERNMENT CIVIL SUIT ALLEGED THAT A DEFECT COULD CAUSE THE REAR BRAKES TO LOCK SENDING THE CAR SPINNING OUT OF CONTROL
465c0208 G. M. WHICH NO LONGER MAKES X. CARS DENIED THAT THE BRAKES ARE DEFECTIVE
465c0209 AGREEING WITH G. M. JUDGE JACKSON RULED THAT THE GOVERNMENT CAME TO COURT WITH "DOUBLE-QUOTE NOTHING MORE ESSENTIALLY THAN A REASONABLE SUSPICION "DOUBLE-QUOTE THAT A DEFECT EXISTED
465c020a BY NOW THERE IS LITTLE ELSE MR. FALCIGNO CAN DO TO HYPE ATTENDANCE
465c020b THAT DOESN'T MEAN HE DOESN'T HAVE OTHER WORRIES
465c020c COUNTERFEIT TICKETS HAVE BEEN A PROBLEM ALTHOUGH A NEW TYPE OF TICKET WITH A SPECIAL EDGE AND WEAVE SEEMS TO HAVE PROVIDED A TEMPORARY SOLUTION
465c020d NOT A SINGLE BROADCAST SIGNAL WAS PIRATED FROM THE ONE THOUSAND PLUS SITES RECEIVING THE HAGLER LEONARD FIGHT THANKS TO A NEWLY DEVELOPED DECODER BOX
465c020e THE JOURNAL'S CLIFFORD KRAUSS LAST MONTH DESCRIBED THE DEEP ANTIPATHY AMONG THE LOCAL POPULATION TOWARD THE POLICIES AND SURVEILLANCE TECHNIQUES OF THE SANDINISTAS' INTERNAL TRADE MINISTRY
465c020f IN THE AMERICAS COLUMN PUBLISHED ON THIS PAGE LAST FRIDAY <NOISE> DOUGLAS PAYNE DESCRIBED NICARAGUA'S GROWING ECONOMIC INTEGRATION WITH THE SOVIET BLOC
465c020g AND YESTERDAY ON THE WASHINGTON POST'S OP ED PAGE LA PRENSA PUBLISHER VIOLETA CHAMORRO DESCRIBED THE EXTENT OF PRESS CENSORSHIP
465c020h THE REACTION FROM THE FREE WORLD SHE WROTE AND THE LEADERS WHO CALL THEMSELVES DEMOCRATS HAS BEEN LITTLE
465c020i THE SEVEN SIGNATORIES HAVE AGREED TO POLICIES AIMED AT REDUCING THEIR INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL IMBALANCES
465c020j THUS THEY ARE MAKING A CONTRIBUTION TO STABILIZING THEIR EXCHANGE RELATIONS JEOPARDIZED BY THE HIGHLY EXCESSIVE DEFICITS AND SURPLUSES THAT HAVE DEVELOPED IN RECENT YEARS
465c020k MOREOVER THEY ARE READY IF NEED BE TO INTERVENE ON EXCHANGE MARKETS
465c020l ANALYST THOMAS ROONEY OF DONALDSON LUFKIN AND JENRETTE GOT SCORES OF CALLS FROM CLIENTS ABOUT THE RUMORS
465c020m HE ESTIMATES PRIME'S DOMESTIC BUSINESS MAY BE OFF TWENTY PERCENT TO TWENTY FIVE PERCENT WITH FOREIGN SALES UP BY ABOUT THE SAME PERCENTAGE
465c020n DOMESTIC SALES ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT HALF OF PRIME'S NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN REVENUE
465c020o AS A RESULT THE GOVERNMENT IS TALKING OF HIGHER FARM PRICES
465c020p BUT HIGHER FARM PRICES WOULD ADD TO AN ALREADY STEEP INFLATION RATE
465c020q SO BEIJING OFFICIALS REPORTEDLY TALK OF TYING WAGES TO INFLATION AN IDEA REMINISCENT OF THE WAGE INDEXATION TRIED IN SOME LATIN AMERICAN NATIONS SEVERAL YEARS AGO WITH DISASTROUS RESULTS
465c020r THE AGREEMENT CALLS FOR DOVER TO MAKE A TENDER OFFER FOR CHIEF AUTOMOTIVE'S EIGHT POINT THREE MILLION SHARES OUTSTANDING
465c020s EACH CHIEF AUTOMOTIVE SHARE THAT ISN'T TENDERED WILL BE CONVERTED INTO A RIGHT TO RECEIVE FIFTEEN DOLLARS IN CASH DOVER SAID
465c020t THE OFFER BEGAN TODAY AND IS SET TO EXPIRE AT MIDNIGHT E. D. T. JULY TWENTIETH
465c020u BANKAMERICA OFFICIALS HOPE THAT LIKE THE EARLIER PROBLEMS THE IMPROVING FINANCES WILL FEED ON THEMSELVES
465c020v IT IS COUNTING ON A STRONGER CREDIT RATING TO ALLOW IT TO BECOME MORE THAN A MINOR LEAGUER IN PITCHING LUCRATIVE INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY SWAPS
465c020w MONEY TO PROMOTE A FLAGGING GLOBAL CORPORATE COMPUTER SERVICE IS BECOMING AVAILABLE
465c020x SO IS SUPPORT FOR A BEEFED UP TEAM OF DEAL MAKERS TO BROKER MERGERS AMONG CALIFORNIA COMPANIES
465c020y NONE OF THESE AREAS HOWEVER HOLD THE PROSPECT OF QUICK GROWTH
465c020z SO FAR THE ADMINISTRATION HAS IGNORED THESE APPEALS AND SO HAVE MR. REED AND OTHER BANKERS
465c0210 IT SEEMS THAT THE PRINCIPLES ENUNCIATED AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS DECADE BY MESSRS.
465c0211 WRISTON AND THEOBALD STILL PREVAIL IF NOT IN LENDING THE BANK'S MONEY AT LEAST IN SUGGESTING THAT OTHER INVESTORS PUT UP THE CASH
465c0212 HOWEVER CONVENTIONAL FILM WILL BE MARGINALLY PROFITABLE AT BEST FOR POLAROID BECAUSE INITIALLY POLAROID WON'T BE MANUFACTURING THE FILM CONTENDS ELLIOTT NOVAK AN INDUSTRY CONSULTANT
465c0213 INSTEAD IT WILL BUY THE FILM FROM ANOTHER COMPANY AND PUT ITS NAME ON IT JUST AS IT DOES WITH VIDEOTAPE
465c0214 SINCE IT BEGAN SELLING VIDEOTAPE A FEW YEARS AGO POLAROID HAS BUILT UP AN IMPRESSIVE TWELVE PERCENT MARKET SHARE MAKING IT THE LEADER IN THE U. S.
465c0215 BUT FIERCE COMPETITION HAS KEPT VIDEOTAPE PROFITS SLIM AND THE CONVENTIONAL FILM BUSINESS ISN'T LIKELY TO PROVE ANY BONANZA EITHER
465c0216 REACTING TO THE EROSION OF CONFUCIAN VALUES MANY KOREANS ARE TURNING TO RELIGION ESPECIALLY CHRISTIANITY
465c0217 BUDDHISM IS ENJOYING A RESURGENCE AS WELL
465c0218 THEY'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING SAYS MR. SEO
465c0219 OTHERS ARE LOOKING TO THE PAST
465c021a ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES STUDENTS ARE JOINING CLUBS TO LEARN TRADITIONAL KOREAN ARTS AND CRAFTS
465c021b MANY ANTI GOVERNMENT ANTI AMERICAN STUDENT DEMONSTRATIONS ARE CARRIED OUT TO THE BEAT OF TRADITIONAL KOREAN DRUMS

465c0303 IT SET UP A SIMILAR PLANT IN WALES IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE
465c0304 AS A RESULT MANY INSURANCE ISSUES ARE DOWN TEN PERCENT TO TWENTY FIVE PERCENT FROM THEIR HIGHS <NOISE> REACHED MOSTLY LAST SPRING
465c0305 THE BULLS ARGUE HOWEVER THAT SELLERS ARE LEAVING THE PARTY TOO SOON
465c0306 FOR ONE THING THEY SAY THE LARGE PREMIUM INCREASES OF THE PAST FEW YEARS HAVE ONLY BEGUN TO APPEAR IN INSURERS' *BOTTOM* LINES
465c0307 FOR NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN EARNINGS GAINS OF TWENTY FIVE PERCENT TO MORE THAN FIFTY PERCENT FROM NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX LEVELS ARE ALMOST A CERTAINTY AT THESE COMPANIES
465c0308 AND MOST ANALYSTS EXPECT THE EARNINGS GROWTH TO CONTINUE ALBEIT AT A MORE MODEST RATE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT
465c0309 HOWEVER ONE SOURCE CLOSE TO THE COMPANIES SAID HE WOULDN'T RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF LIMITED BUYING I. MAGNIN
465c030a LIMITED CHAIRMAN LESLIE H. WEXNER HAS SAID HE IS INTERESTED IN OPERATING A SPECIALTY DEPARTMENT STORE
465c030b LIMITED OPERATES SUCH STORES AS LIMITED LIMITED EXPRESS LANE BRYANT HENRI BENDEL AND VICTORIA'S SECRET
465c030c TO GET AROUND THAT REQUIREMENT INSURERS CAN PAY A REINSURER TO ASSUME PART OF THE RISK OF LOSS ON THE ANNUITY IN RETURN FOR PART OF THE PREMIUM
465c030d BUT MOST REINSURANCE CONTRACTS DON'T TRANSFER INVESTMENT RISK THE RISK OF FAILING TO EARN ENOUGH TO PAY THE PROMISED RATES
465c030e THAT'S WHERE FIRST EXECUTIVE WHICH HAS RELIED HEAVILY ON REINSURANCE TO SUPPORT EXPANSION OF IT BUSINESS AND THE REGULATORS HAVEN'T AGREED ON THE PROPER FORM OF CONTRACT
465c030f THE KROH BROTHERS MISMANAGED BUT IT WAS NOT FOR THE PURPOSE OF LINING THEIR OWN POCKETS HE SAYS

465c030n IT TRADITIONALLY HAS SOLD ITS FUNDS THROUGH DIRECT MARKETING TECHNIQUES SUCH AS NEWSPAPER AND MAGAZINE ADVERTISING BACKED BY A TELEPHONE NETWORK
465c030o ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY CLEARLY ISN'T ABANDONING SUCH METHODS IT IS LOOKING TO BROKER DEALERS TO SELL THE NEW FUND LINE
465c030p THE UNION SAID THE WORKERS' COMPLAINTS PERSUADED IT TO PLACE A TEAM OF ORGANIZERS IN SMYRNA LAST JULY
465c030q IT HAS STARTED COLLECTING SUPPORT CARDS FROM EMPLOYEES AND IF THIRTY PERCENT OF THE PLANT'S THREE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED WORKERS SIGN UP THE UNION CAN REQUEST AN ELECTION
465c030r MR. BIEBER SAID THE UNION HASN'T SET A DEADLINE TO COMPLETE THE DRIVE
465c030s AFTER COLLECTING THE SIGNATURES THE U. A. W. CAN ASK NISSAN TO RECOGNIZE THE UNION WITHOUT AN ELECTION <NOISE> ALTHOUGH THE ACQUIESCENCE BY NISSAN ISN'T CONSIDERED LIKELY

466c0203 AMONG THEM TOO MUCH CAPITAL CHASING TOO FEW CANDIDATES WHICH HAS PUSHED COSTS UP AND RETURNS DOWN TO WHAT THEY SEE AS UNACCEPTABLE LEVELS
466c0204 THE S. E. C. SANCTIONS AGAINST THE FIRM AND MR. BLINDER WERE HANDED DOWN IN DECEMBER
466c0205 THE RULINGS STEM FROM A NINETEEN EIGHTY UNDERWRITING BY MR. BLINDER AND HIS FIRM OF AMERICAN LEISURE CORP. A CASINO COMPANY IN NEW YORK
466c0206 THE S. E. C. ACCUSED THE BROKERAGE OF FRAUD IN THE DEAL
466c0207 MR. GITTIS SAID THE LAWSUITS WOULD HAVE LITTLE INFLUENCE ON THE RESPONSE OF REVLON'S BOARD TO TENDER THE OFFER
466c0208 HE SAID MACANDREWS AND FORBES RATHER THAN REVLON IS BORROWING THE MONEY NEEDED TO ACQUIRE REVLON AND TAKE IT PRIVATE
466c0209 WE'RE SELLING EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION OF NOTES IN A PRIVATE PLACEMENT HE SAID
466c020a IF WE WERE USING REVLON ASSETS THE SUITS COULD BE TROUBLESOME
466c020b INTEREST RATES WERE MIXED ON NEW SHORT TERM TREASURY BILLS AT THE GOVERNMENT'S REGULAR WEEKLY AUCTION YESTERDAY
466c020c THE AVERAGE RATE ON NEW THIRTEEN WEEK TREASURY BILLS ROSE TO FIVE POINT EIGHT ONE PERCENT FROM FIVE POINT SEVEN PERCENT AT LAST WEEK'S SALE
466c020d THE AVERAGE RATE ON NEW TWENTY SIX WEEK BILLS FELL TO SIX POINT ONE PERCENT FROM SIX POINT ONE EIGHT PERCENT THE PREVIOUS WEEK
466c020e JUNE'S LOAD FACTOR OR PERCENTAGE OF SEATS FILLED TOTALED SIXTY FOUR POINT THREE PERCENT RANKING CONTINENTAL NEAR THE BOTTOM OF MAJOR U. S. AIRLINES
466c020f THE FIGURE ROSE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM MAY'S LOW LEVEL OF SIXTY POINT ONE PERCENT BUT TRAILED THE S- SIXTY FIVE POINT FIVE PERCENT OF A YEAR EARLIER
466c020g FOR THE MONTH CONTINENTAL FLEW THREE POINT THREE BILLION REVENUE PASSENGER MILES A NINETY FIVE PERCENT INCREASE FROM THE ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION MILES A YEAR EARLIER
466c020h A REVENUE PASSENGER MILE IS ONE PAYING M- PASSENGER FLOWN ONE MILE
466c020i THE INCREASE REFLECTS THE CONSOLIDATION WITH PEOPLE EXPRESS
466c020j THE JAPANESE STOCK MARKET IS AWASH WITH LIQUIDITY MR. GRANT SAYS
466c020k BUT IN JUNE SUDDENLY WITH NO APPARENT DRAINAGE IT WENT DOWN AND KEPT GOING DOWN HE SAYS
466c020l WHAT IS A MYSTERY TO MR. GRANT AND MANY OTHERS IS THAT THE TOKYO MARKET HAS SINCE STAGED A VIGOROUS REBOUND
466c020m <NOISE> A ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR ISSUE OF HOUSEHOLD FINANCE CORP. SEVEN YEAR NOTES WAS OFFERED THROUGH UNDERWRITERS LED BY MERRILL LYNCH CAPITAL MARKETS
466c020n THE TEN PERCENT NOTES WERE PRICED AT PAR AND THE RETURN IS POINT SEVEN TWO OF A PERCENTAGE POINT ABOVE THE RATE ON COMPARABLE TREASURY NOTES
466c020o THE STANDARD NOTES ARE RATED DOUBLE A THREE BY MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE INC. AND DOUBLE A MINUS BY STANDARD AND POOR'S CORP.
466c020p IF ITS MAVERICK STRATEGY WORKS SECURITY PACIFIC WILL BE SHOWING ANOTHER WAY BESIDES ACQUISITIONS FOR SUPERREGIONAL BANKS TO GROW
466c020q THESE BANKS' MANAGERS INCLUDING MR. FLAMSON PLAN TO EVENTUALLY CHALLENGE THE BIG NEW YORK BANKS AS NATIONAL GIANTS IN THEIR OWN RIGHT
466c020r BOLSTERED BY STRONG EQUITY CAPITAL POSITIONS SUPERREGIONALS ALREADY ARE GROWING FASTER THAN MONEY CENTER INSTITUTIONS
466c020s PASSAGE OF THE KENNEDY MARKEY BILL OR SIMILAR GRANTS OF MORAL RIGHTS WOULD ENRICH ESTABLISHED ARTISTS AT THE EXPENSE OF THEIR STRUGGLING COMPETITORS
466c020t IN ADDITION THE THEORY OF MORAL RIGHTS IS BOTH PHILOSOPHICALLY UNTENABLE AND AN INVITATION TO AN ORGY OF L- LITIGATION AND LEGAL CONFUSION
466c020u CONGRESS SHOULD REFUSE TO GRANT ARTISTS SPECIAL RIGHTS AND SHOULD REFUSE TO SIGN THE BERN CONVENTION
466c020v <NOISE> THEY CLASSIFIED EVERYTHING I HAD TO SAY AS RACIST OR SEXIST SAYS MR. SCHAUB <NOISE>
466c020w WHERE'S THE FREEDOM OF INQUIRY
466c020x BEATS US
466c020y BUT IF YOU FIND A COLLEGE ADMINISTRATOR WHO ISN'T COWERING FROM N- THE NEW ORTHODOXY LET US KNOW
466c020z SOME ECONOMISTS SAY INFLATIONARY PRESSURES COULD CONTINUE TO PUSH UP U. S. INTEREST RATES THIS YEAR
466c0210 IF SO FOREIGN CENTRAL BANKS MAY SEE THAT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO TIGHTEN AND TO ADDRESS THEIR OWN INFLATION WORRIES DESPITE U. S. CONCERN
466c0211 ONE FEAR SAYS IRVING TRUST ECONOMIST ROBERT MCGEE IS THAT HIGHER GLOBAL RATES WILL SEND THE FINANCIAL MARKETS INTO A TAILSPIN
466c0212 BY CONTRACTING OUT PRODUCTION TO AMERICAN PLANTS THEY ARE SAVING MORE THAN A DIME PER CAN OF DRINK
466c0213 THEIR NEXT LOGICAL STEP ANALYSTS SAY WILL BE TO ACQUIRE U. S. SOFT DRINK CONCERNS
466c0214 EVENTUALLY THEY MIGHT EVEN BREAK INTO THE ENORMOUS U. S. MARKET
466c0215 AND IT DOESN'T APPEAR THAT CABLE OWNERS WILL RESIST THE CHANGE
466c0216 A SPOKESMAN FOR THE NATIONAL CABLE TELEVISION ASSOCIATION SAID WE DON'T OPPOSE THE PROPOSAL IN PRINCIPLE
466c0217 WE TAKE THE POSITION THAT THE MORE PEOPLE IN THE CABLE MARKET THE BETTER
466c0218 THE PLOT IS A TRUE LIFE TALE OF M. C. A. ITSELF AND THE ENDING HAS YET TO BE PLAYED OUT
466c0219 BUT THE REVELATIONS HAVE ALREADY RAISED EYEBROWS IN HOLLYWOOD WHERE M. C. A. IS CONSIDERED PART OF THE BEDROCK OF THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY
466c021a M. C. A. HAD TWO POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN REVENUE LAST YEAR OWNS UNIVERSAL STUDIOS AND IS A TELEVISION MUSIC AND REAL ESTATE GIANT
466c021b THE COMPANY HASN'T BEEN CHARGED WITH ANY WRONGDOING BUT RECENT PU- PUBLICITY ABOUT ITS TANGLE OF BUSINESS DEALINGS THREATENS AT THE VERY LEAST TO SULLY ITS REPUTATION
466c021c EDUCATION IS THE OPPORTUNITY THROUGH STUDYING A VARIETY OF SUBJECTS TO GAIN INFORMATION AND THE DEXTERITY TO USE YOUR WITS AND YOUR EXPRESSION
466c021d EDUCATION PREPARES YOU TO BE SOMEONE MORE THAN TO DO SOMETHING
466c021e EDUCATION IS WHAT PREPARES YOU TO HEAR MORE WHEN YOU LISTEN TO REACH DEEPER WHEN YOU THINK TO SAY MORE WHEN YOU SPEAK
466c0301 MOST UNUSUALLY THIS TIME AROUND THE C:YCLICAL CLIMB IN PLANT USAGE HASN'T YET OCCURRED
466c0302 AS F- THE EXPANSION KEEPS ROLLING HOWEVER THIS IS EXPECTED TO COME
466c0303 WHEN IT DOES FORECASTERS LOOK FOR BRISKER CAPITAL SPENDING AS WELL REGARDLESS OF THE NEW TAX RULES
466c0304 IT'S A SAD DAY FOR WALL STREET SAID A FIRST BOSTON CORP. SPOKESMAN
466c0305 STOCK TRADERS CAUTIONED THAT THE GOVERNMENT HASN'T YET WON CONVICTIONS ON ITS LATEST CASES
466c0306 BUT BOTH LAWMAKERS AND STOCK MARKET PROFESSIONALS SAID YESTERDAY'S ARRESTS SEND A CLEAR SIGNAL AN OVERHAUL OF TAKEOVER AND SECURITIES PRACTICES HAS BECOME I- INCREASINGLY LIKELY
466c0307 THE SINGAPORE ECONOMY AFTER ITS FIRST DOWNTURN IN NEARLY TWO DECADES OF DOUBLE DIGIT GROWTH IS ON THE RE- ROAD TO RECOVERY ANALYSTS SAY
466c0308 AFTER CONTRACTING ONE POINT EIGHT PERCENT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE THE ISLAND'S GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT GREW ONE POINT NINE PERCENT LAST YEAR ACCORDING TO THE GOVERNMENT'S INITIAL ESTIMATES
466c0309 EXPANSION OF THREE PERCENT TO FOUR PERCENT IS PREDICTED FOR THIS YEAR
466c030a THIS YEAR THE SAME FORCES ARE AT WORK
466c030b I BELIEVE THE CHANCES OF A REPEAT OF LAST YEAR'S PERFORMANCE ARE HIGH SAYS WILLIAM STERLING A MERRILL LYNCH ECONOMIST IN TOKYO
466c030c HE EXPECTS TO SEE ONLY ABOUT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS OF ADDITIONAL SPENDING NOT THE THIRTY SIX BILLION DOLLARS THAT MR. NAKASONE IS TALKING ABOUT
466c030d HER HUSBAND CARL IS A PENNSYLVANIA STATE TROOPER
466c030e TO AVOID ANY CONFLICT OVER SALARIES THEY PUT HER FORTY SIX THOUSAND DOLLAR ANNUAL INCOME IN A SAVINGS ACCOUNT AND LIVE OFF HIS THIRTY ONE THOUSAND DOLLAR INCOME
466c030f I LOOK AT IT AS SEVENTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT WE MADE TOGETHER SAYS MR. STEPHENS
466c030g BAD MANAGEMENT MAY BE COMMON ENOUGH IN AMERICAN BUSINESS BUT THE RISKS PRESENTED BY BADLY RUN NUCLEAR PLANTS ARE FRIGHTENING
466c030h NO LEVEL OF TECHNICAL SAFEGUARDS CAN MAKE A NUCLEAR FACILITY SAFE UNLESS IT HAS GOOD MANAGEMENT THE N. R. C. TOLD CONGRESS LAST YEAR
466c030i INDEED THE AGENCY RECENTLY HAS BEGUN TO CLOSE PLANTS BECAUSE OF MANAGEMENT NOT JUST MECHANICAL SHORTCOMINGS
466c030j IN APRIL FOR INSTANCE THE AGENCY ORDERED PHILADELPHIA ELECTRIC COMPANY TO TURN OFF ITS PEACH BOTTOM PLANT AFTER INSPECTORS FOUND OPERATORS ASLEEP AT THE CONTROLS
466c030k UNFAIR OR NOT THE QUESTIONS ARE BEING ASKED ABOUT BOTH THE REVOLUTION'S ROUTE AND ITS GOALS HOW MUCH VIOLENCE WILL THERE BE
466c030l WILL WHITES HAVE POLITICAL RIGHTS
466c030m HOW MANY WHITES WILL LOSE THEIR JOBS
466c030n HOW COMMUNIST IS THE A. N. C.
466c030o HOW MUCH WILL THE GOVERNMENT CONTROL THE ECONOMY
466c030p ARE THE DANES SUPPOSED TO LISTEN SERIOUSLY TO SECRETARY SHULTZ WHEN HE TELLS THEM THAT THE PROPOSED DANISH POLICY TOWARD SHIPS UNDERCUTS THE NUCLEAR DETERRENCE OF NATO
466c030q WASN'T MR. SHULTZ JUST IN MOSCOW WORKING ON YET ANOTHER NUCLEAR TREATY
466c030r HAVEN'T AMERICAN DIPLOMATS AT NATO BEEN TELLING EVERYONE THAT COMPARED WITH THE POLITICAL EFFECTS OF NOT RATI(FYING)- RATIFYING THE TREATY THE POLITICAL EFFECTS OF RATIFICATION WOULD BE MINIMAL
466c030s MANY FUND MANAGERS HERE SAY AMERICA ISN'T TAKING THE STRONG MEDICINE NEEDED TO CURB HIGH CONSUMER SPENDING IMPROVE LOW PERSONAL SAVINGS RATES AND COMBAT THE STU(BBORN)- STUBBORN DUAL DEFICITS
466c030t THEY DON'T EXPECT ANY PROGRESS BEFORE THE NEW U. S. PRESIDENT TAKES OFFICE NEXT YEAR AND SAY BOTH INFLATION AND INTEREST RATES PROBABLY WILL RISE
466c030u THIS WOULD INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF A: NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE RECESSION
466c030v MR. KAVNER SAID THE RIVAL GROUP LACKS A CLEAR PROCESS FOR RESOLVING DIFFERENCES
466c030w IN ADDITION HE SAID A. T. AND T. SPENDS FAR MORE EACH YEAR ON DEVELOPING UNIX THAN THE OPEN SOFTWARE FOUNDATION HAS INDICATED IT WILL SPEND
466c030x HE ADDED THAT A. T. AND T. PLANS TO INCORPORATE INTO ITS UNIX ANY USEFUL FEATURES FROM ITS RIVALS' VERSION
466c030y MR. WATT IS ECSTATIC
466c030z YOU CAN TEACH WHOLE HISTORY LESSONS FROM THIS VILLAGE INCLUDING ARCHITECTURE SOCIOLOGY AND ART HE SAYS
466c0310 THESE WEALTHY LANDLORDS GOT BIGGER AND MORE POWERFUL AND THAT LED TO THE BREAKDOWN OF THE HAN EMPIRE
466c0311 THE OWNERS BECAME POWERFUL LORDS AND THE GUARDS IN THE TOWERS BECAME PRIVATE ARMIES
466c0312 RICK BRIGGS PRESIDENT OF THE UNION SAID FALCONBRIDGE'S LATEST PROPOSALS ON CONTRACTING OUT ARE NOT ENCOURAGING
466c0313 THE PROPOSALS WERE PRESENTED YESTERDAY AFTER A TWO DAY RECESS IN THE TALKS
466c0314 ABOUT FORTY PERCENT OF FALCONBRIDGE'S NICKEL OUTPUT COMES FROM ITS SUDBURY OPERATIONS
466c0315 DETAILS ARE STILL MURKY ABOUT THE REST OF THE CREDITS
466c0316 ITALIAN OFFICIALS SAY THAT ROME'S DECISION TO GRANT ABOUT A SEVEN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR GUARANTEE OF EXPORT CREDITS WAS PRIMARILY A POLITICAL RATHER THAN A BANKING DECISION
466c0317 BRITAIN'S MIDLAND BANK HAS ANNOUNCED PLANS FOR A ONE BILLION DOLLAR CREDIT LINE THOUGH SOME BRITISH BANKS MAY BE GETTING COLD FEET ABOUT PARTICIPATING
466c0318 FRENCH BANKS HAVE YET TO ANNOUNCE THEIR PLANS OFFICIALLY BUT ARE SAID TO BE CONSIDERING LOANS OF TWO BILLION DOLLARS
466c0319 THE FED REPORT GAVE NO HINT THAT MAKERS OF CAPITAL EQUIPMENT EXPECT DEMAND FOR THEIR WARES TO FALL OFF
466c031a PRODUCTION OF BUSINESS EQUIPMENT THOUGH REDUCED BY THE DROP IN AUTO AND TRUCK PRODUCTION GREW POINT TWO PERCENT IN JULY AFTER REMAINING FLAT IN JUNE
466c031b THE FED ATTRIBUTED THE INCREASE TO STEPPED UP PRODUCTION OF COMMERCIAL AND FACTORY EQUIPMENT AS WELL AS AIRCRAFT
466c031c OUTPUT OF INDUSTRIAL MATERIALS ALSO REBOUNDED IN JULY AFTER DROPPING FOR TWO MONTHS
466c031d IT'S KIND OF LIKE EATING PEANUTS ISN'T IT SAID MR. MURPHY
466c031e ONCE YOU START IT'S TOUGH TO STOP
466c031f THE UMPTEENTH SOUNDS OF L:EAD SMACKING METAL AND A RIFLE BEING S- COCKED S:ERVED AS A QUICK ANSWER TO HIS QUESTION
466c0401 THEY HAVE PUT IN A LOT OF MONEY BUT IS THAT ENOUGH
466c0402 NOBODY KNOWS SAID MR. BRAY
466c0403 IN OCTOBER WE THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE ENOUGH BUT BETWEEN OCTOBER AND NOW IT'S PROVEN TO BE NOT ENOUGH
466c0404 WHO KNOWS HOW MUCH IT WILL BE
466c0405 WITH THE SPEAKER BEHIND IT GEPHARDT WILL PASS ON THE HOUSE FLOOR SAID REPRESENTATIVE DONALD PEASE DEMOCRAT OF OHIO
466c0406 ADDED REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN DONNELLY DEMOCRAT OF MASSACHUSETTS ON THE SPEAKER'S REMARKS IT COMES AS NO SURPRISE
466c0407 HE FEELS STRONGLY THAT OUR TRADING PARTNERS WON'T TAKE US SERIOUSLY UNLESS HIT OVER THE HEAD WITH A PROVISION LIKE GEPHARDT
466c0408 ENERGY EXPERTS CONSIDER AMOCO AND EXXON AMONG THE INDUSTRY'S HEALTHIEST COMPANIES FINANCIALLY WITH STRONG CREDIT RATINGS AND LOW DEBT
466c0409 AMOCO'S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHOW IT HAD FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN CASH AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES ON HAND AT THE CLOSE OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
466c040a IN RECENT TALKS WITH ANALYSTS AMOCO OFFICIALS HAVE SAID THE COMPANY IS WELL POSITIONED FINANCIALLY IF IT DECIDES TO MAKE AN ACQUISITION
466c040b IF THE PR- PROPOSED TRANSACTION IS COMPLETED COCA COLA WILL BE LEFT WITH HUGE BORROWING CAPACITY
466c040c COCA COLA SAID ITS PRO FORMA DEBT WOULD BE REDUCED TO ABOUT NINE PERCENT OF TOTAL CAPITAL
466c040d THE COMPANY'S DEBT WAS TWENTY SIX PERCENT OF CAPITAL AT THE END OF THE SECOND QUARTER ITS TARGET RATIO IS THIRTY FIVE PERCENT
466c040e THE UNION SAID THE ENGINEERS WERE LEAVING THEIR VESSELS WHEN THEY DOCKED
466c040f LATE YESTERDAY NINETEEN SHIPS WERE REPORTED TO BE TIED UP BECAUSE OF THE STRIKE
466c040g THE UNION WHICH REPRESENTS ENGINEERS ON ABOUT EIGHTY GREAT LAKES SHIPS HAS BEEN WITHOUT A CONTRACT SINCE MAY THIRTY ONE
466c040h THE FORECAST IS A BIT ROSIER THAN THAT OF MOST PRIVATE A- ANALYSTS
466c040i IN ITS LATEST SURVEY BLUE CHIP ECONOMIC INDICATORS CONSENSUS FORECAST PUTS GROWTH AT ONE POINT EIGHT PERCENT THIS YEAR
466c040j MORE THAN THREE FOURTHS OF THE ECONOMISTS POLLED EXPECT A RECESSION TO START BEFORE THE END OF NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE
466c040k AS OF APRIL ONE ALL INTEREST INCOME WILL BE TAXED AT TWENTY PERCENT
466c040l EXEMPTIONS INCLUDE SINGLE MOTHERS THE HANDICAPPED AND THOSE OVER SIXTY FIVE YEARS OLD
466c040m OTHER EXCEPTIONS INCLUDE FUNDS SET ASIDE FOR HOUSING AND PENSIONS
466c040n THE POINT A POINT MR. CAMPBELL KEEPS RETURNING TO IS THAT EVERY RELIGION IS TRUE
466c040o IT'S TRUE AS A METAPHOR FOR THE HUMAN AND COSMIC MYSTERIES
466c040p IT'S ONLY WHEN YOU'RE STUCK ON THE METAPHOR THAT YOU GET IN TROUBLE
466c040q MR. HOWARD NOT ONLY HELPED THE FLEDGLING PUBLIC COMPANIES DRUM UP INTEREST IN THEIR SHARES HE HELPED INVEST THE CAPITAL THEY RAISED IN THE PUBLIC OFFERINGS
466c040r IN MANY CASES THE BANKS HE ADVISED INVESTED LARGE AMOUNTS IN EACH OTHER
466c040s AND THEY LENT FUNDS TO OTHER CLIENTS OF MR. HOWARD WHO SOMETIMES INVESTED IN THE SAME STOCKS
466c040t ACQUIRED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE FRIENDLY REPORTED MODEST GROWTH UNTIL LAST YEAR WHEN LABOR SHORTAGES AND LOWER CONSUMER TRAFFIC HURT THE CHAIN
466c040u THE UNIT IMPROVED SALES WITH HIGHER PRICES NEW STORE OPENINGS AND THE ACQUISITION OF TWO SMALL RESTAURANT CHAINS DURING THE SECOND HALF OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
466c040v HOWEVER FRIENDLY'S NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN PRETAX OPERATING PROFIT OF FORTY FIVE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS WAS BELOW THE PREVIOUS YEAR'S FIFTY POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS

466c040z STUDENTS BUDDHIST MONKS AND OTHERS PARTICIPATED IN THE DEMONSTRATIONS
466c0410 WE'VE ALWAYS WONDERED HOW TO SQUARE NICARAGUAN <NOISE> PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA'S ROUGH WORDS WITH HIS SOFT TREATMENT IN THE DEMOCRATIC CONTROLLED U. S. CONGRESS
466c0411 MAYBE HE HAS TOO BECAUSE HE'S UPPED THE ANTE
466c0412 HE HAS NOW BRANDED NOT ONLY THE REPUBLICANS BUT ALSO THE DEMOCRATS AS IMPERIALISTS BECAUSE BOTH PARTIES HAVE TALKED RECENTLY ABOUT HELPING THE CONTRAS
466c0413 WHAT DO THE DEMOCRATS BECOME IF THEY ACTUALLY VOTE THE BANDAGES
466c0414 THE TREASURY IS SCHEDULED TO ANNOUNCE DETAILS OF ITS QUARTERLY FINANCING OPERATION NOVEMBER TWO
466c0415 IT USUALLY CONSISTS OF THREE YEAR NOTES TEN YEAR NOTES AND THIRTY YEAR BONDS
466c0416 BUT THE DEPARTMENT IS VERY CLOSE TO REACHING ITS LIMITS ON ISSUING LONG TERM DEBT AND THUS HAS ASKED CONGRESS TO INCREASE ITS AUTHORITY
466c0417 CONGRESS STILL HASN'T COMPLETED WORK ON THE ISSUE WHICH IS PART OF THE B- TAX BILL PASSED LATE TUESDAY BY THE SENATE
466c0418 CLARKE SWANSON NOTING THAT NINETEEN MILLION WOMEN HAD STAYED IN THE WORK FORCE AFTER WORLD WAR TWO THOUGHT THEY COULD USE HELP IN WHIPPING UP QUICK MEALS
466c0419 SO IN NINETEEN FIFTY ONE THE SWANSON COMPANY BEGAN SELLING FROZEN POT PIES TURKEY CHICKEN AND MEAT

466c041e <NOISE> IN ESTONIA THE COMMUNIST PARTY CHIEF URGED ETHNIC RUSSIAN WORKERS TO END A SIX DAY STRIKE OVER A NEW LAW TIGHTENING RESIDENCY REQUIREMENTS
466c041f STRIKES ALSO WERE THREATENED IN GEORGIA
467c0201 <NOISE> FIRST OF ALL THE POLICY CONSERVATIVES WILL PURSUE THEIR UNFINISHED AGENDA OF DEREGULATION IN AREAS FROM FINANCIAL SERVICES TO REGULATION AS A DRAG ON U. S. INTERNATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS
467c0202 THEY SAY THE ADMINISTRATION MISSED ITS CHANCE AND ALLOWED ITS DEREGULATORY CAMPAIGN TO BE ALL BUT ABORTED BY CONTROVERSY OVER ANNE GORSUCH AND JIM WATT
467c0203 THEY THINK THEIR GENERAL CASE IN THIS AREA IS OVERWHELMING
467c0204 THEY WILL GIVE IT NEW APPLICATIONS AND CARRY IT TO NEW FORUMS
467c0205 THE NEW SERVICE DIFFERS FROM THE SHUTTLE IN SEVERAL WAYS
467c0206 IT WON'T HAVE THE BACKUP PLANES THAT THE SHUTTLE USES TO ACCOMMODATE PASSENGER OVERFLOW
467c0207 THE NEW FLIGHTS WILL INCLUDE ADVANCE SEAT SELECTION AND FIRST CLASS AND COACH SERVICE WHICH THE SHUTTLE DOESN'T
467c0208 SHUTTLE FLIGHTS DEPART ON THE HOUR THE NEW SERVICE WILL OPERATE ON THE HALF HOUR
467c0209 MR. GITTIS SAID THE LAWSUITS WOULD HAVE LITTLE INFLUENCE ON THE RESPONSE OF REVLON'S BOARD TO THE TENDER OFFER
467c020a HE SAID MACANDREWS AND FORBES RATHER THAN REVLON IS BORROWING THE MONEY NEEDED TO ACQUIRE REVLON AND TAKE IT PRIVATE
467c020b WE'RE SELLING EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION OF NOTES IN A PRIVATE PLACEMENT HE SAID
467c020c IF WE WERE USING REVLON ASSETS THE SUITS COULD BE TROUBLESOME
467c020d STILL MR. JOSEPHS AND OTHERS THINK THAT THE CHANGES WILL BE GOOD FOR THE FARM ECONOMY IN GENERAL
467c020e MANY OF THESE GENTLEMEN FARMERS WERE TAX MOTIVATED NOT PROFIT DRIVEN HE SAYS
467c020f <NOISE> SOME ARE UNFAIR COMPETITION AGAINST THE REGULAR FARMER WHO'S TRYING TO MAKE A BUCK
467c020g ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO SOUTHLAND ACKNOWLEDGED THAT IT WAS CONSIDERING RESTRUCTURING ALTERNATIVES BUT WOULDN'T ELABORATE
467c020h THE OWNER AND OPERATOR OF EIGHTY TWO HUNDRED SEVEN ELEVEN STORES REPEATEDLY HAS SAID IT DIDN'T KNOW OF REASONS FOR THE HEAVY TRADING IN ITS STOCK
467c020i BUT STOCK TRADERS CONTINUED TO EXPECT SOUTHLAND TO TAKE SOME ACTION EVEN WHILE SEVERAL ANALYSTS AND INDUSTRY EXECUTIVES SAID THEY BELIEVED SOUTHLAND WOULDN'T RESPOND UNLESS A HOSTILE BIDDER EMERGED
467c020j <NOISE> IN KOREA LABOR CONFLICTS HAVE ADDED HEAT TO THE UNSTABLE POLITICAL SITUATION
467c020k <NOISE> THE NEW UNIONS ARE GROWING MORE ADVERSARIAL
467c020l COMPANIES KEEP ASKING THE GOVERNMENT TO SMASH THE UNIONS
467c020m BUT THE RULING PARTY CAN'T RISK ALIENATING WORKERS WHO WILL VOTE IN THE COMING ELECTIONS
467c020n IT REFUSES SO FAR TO BACKTRACK ON ITS JULY ONE PROMISE OF GREATER DEMOCRACY OR TO RETURN TO THE POLICY OF OVERT UNION BUSTING
467c020o WORLDS OF WONDER NEEDS TO CONVINCE CREDITORS TO EXTEND IT TIME THROUGH THE CHRISTMAS SEASON WHICH IS BY FAR THE BIGGEST SALES PERIOD FOR TOY COMPANIES
467c020p IT'S IN THE CREDITORS' BEST INTEREST TO KEEP THE COMPANY GOING AT LEAST FOR NOW SAID FRED ANSCHEL AN ANALYST WITH DEAN WITTER REYNOLDS INCORPORATED

467c020s DAVID BROCKWAY HAS LEFT AS PLANNED TO JOIN THE WASHINGTON LAW OFFICE OF DEWEY BALLANTINE BUSHBY PALMER AND WOOD
467c020t HIS SUCCESSOR HASN'T BEEN NAMED
467c020u BANKAMERICA IS NOW WRITING OFF FEWER OF ITS PROBLEM LOANS THAN MOST OTHER LARGE BANKS
467c020v THE DEVELOPMENT HAS LEFT SOME ANALYSTS WONDERING WHETHER BEING AGGRESSIVE ENOUGH ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING ITS RECORD OF SURPRISING LOAN PROBLEMS OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS
467c020w BUT BANK OFFICIALS SAID THEY ARE BEING PRUDENT
467c020x THEY SAID LOWER WRITE OFFS REFLECT PREVIOUS HOUSECLEANING AS WELL AS MORE CONSERVATIVE LENDING PRACTICES
467c020y IN ADDITION THE BANK HAS A BEEFED UP TEAM OF SPECIALISTS WHO ARE HAVING INCREASING SUCCESS IN RECOVERING PREVIOUSLY WRITTEN OFF LOANS
467c020z THE ONLY NEW ISSUE PRICED YESTERDAY WAS FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION OF TWELVE YEAR SENIOR SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES FROM U. S. G. CORP.
467c0210 THE HIGH RISK HIGH YIELD ISSUE WAS PRICED AT PAR TO YIELD THIRTEEN AND ONE QUARTER PERCENT BY SALOMON BROTHERS INCORPORATED AND GOLDMAN SACHS AND COMPANY
467c0211 THE OFFERING IS PART OF U. S. G.'S RECAPITALIZATION PLAN
467c0212 MR. ZEHNDER PLAYS DOWN THIS CRITICISM
467c0213 HE POINTS TO THE FACT THAT CREDIT SUISSE LEADS IN THE NUMBER OF PUBLICLY LISTED BONDS LAUNCHED BUT LAGS IN THE NUMBER OF UNLISTED NOTES IT ISSUED
467c0214 <NOISE> THIS IS SIGNIFICANT HE SAYS BECAUSE BOND ISSUES PAY HIGHER COMMISSIONS THAN UNLISTED NOTES
467c0215 IN CONTRAST SENATOR BENTSEN CAMPAIGNED LAST WEEK IN A HALF EMPTY PLANE TO A MEASURED CADENCE
467c0216 HE PORTRAYS GOVERNOR DUKAKIS AS A PRAGMATIC CAN DO EXECUTIVE
467c0217 AND HE OFFERS HIMSELF A BUSINESS ORIENTED SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN AND FORMER INSURANCE EXECUTIVE AS EVIDENCE OF THAT MODERATION
467c0218 THE RECURRING WORDS OF HIS SPEECHES ARE THE WORDS OF THE BOARDROOM COMPETENCE HANDS ON MANAGEMENT ENHANCED RECOVERY
467c0219 MR. KIDDER INSISTS THERE IS CAUSE FOR HOPE
467c021a GOOD TEACHERS PUT SNAGS IN THE RIVER OF CHILDREN PASSING BY AND OVER THE YEARS THEY REDIRECT HUNDREDS OF LIVES
467c021b PERHAPS HE IS RIGHT
467c021c BUT WHAT HE NOTICES AT THE FIFTH GRADE SCIENCE FAIR SEEMS MORE SIGNIFICANT
467c021d THE RESULTS OF THAT PAINFUL CHARADE DON'T REFLECT SOCIAL STATUS ETHNIC BACKGROUND OR TEACHING TECHNIQUE THEY REFLECT THE CONTRIBUTION OF EACH CHILD'S PARENTS
467c021e AVIATION INSURANCE IS UNDER INTENSE PRESSURE
467c021f THE GLOBAL AIRLINE PREMIUMS HAVE DROPPED TO ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED MILLION FROM ABOUT ONE BILLION IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
467c021g MEANWHILE AIRLINE LOSSES IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT ROSE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE PREVIOUS YEAR
467c0301 THE ECONOMIC FALLOUT SHOULDN'T BE IGNORED HOWEVER
467c0302 A PROVISION IN THE SPENDING BILL REQUIRES THAT AT LEAST ONE THIRD OF THE REPAIR AND OVERHAUL WORK ON SHIPS BE DONE LOCALLY AT THEIR HOME PORTS
467c0303 THAT MAKES IT A BIG DEAL FOR TODD AND LOCKHEED MR. DICKS SAYS REFERRING TO TWO PUGET SOUND SHIPYARDS
467c0304 THE GOVERNMENT CIVIL SUIT ALLEGED THAT A DEFECT COULD CAUSE THE REAR BRAKES TO LOCK SENDING THE CAR SPINNING OUT OF CONTROL
467c0305 G. M. WHICH NO LONGER MAKES X. CARS DENIED THAT THE BRAKES ARE DEFECTIVE
467c0306 AGREEING WITH G. M. JUDGE JACKSON RULED THAT THE GOVERNMENT CAME TO COURT WITH NOTHING MORE ESSENTIALLY THAN A REASONABLE SUSPICION THAT A DEFECT EXISTED
467c0307 INCO'S STOCK HAS CAUGHT TECHNICAL ANALYSTS' ATTENTION TOO <NOISE>
467c0308 IT RECENTLY BROKE OUT OF A FIVE YEAR TRADING RANGE SAYS MARTIN PRING EDITOR OF PRING MARKET REVIEW
467c0309 HE THINKS THE STOCK COULD BE POISED FOR BIG GAINS REFLECTING WHAT MAY BE A BULL MARKET IN BASE METALS
467c030a <NOISE> RENT CONTROL IS AS BAD AS THE INCOME TAX DEDUCTION FOR HOME OWNERSHIP
467c030b ALL THE BENEFICIARIES OF THE DEDUCTION ARE HIGH INCOME EARNERS NOT SIMPLY SOME OF THEM
467c030c IT LEADS TO EXTRA LARGE SWIMMING POOLS EXTRA BEDROOMS IN BEVERLY HILLS BUT NO HOUSING FOR THE PEOPLE WHO NEED IT MOST
467c030d STILL WHEN THIS ISSUE WAS LAST VOTED ON IN CONGRESS EIGHTY FIVE OUT OF EIGHTY FIVE SENATORS PRESENT VOTED FOR IT
467c030e THE ONLY SURPRISING THING GIVEN THE NUMBER OF BENEFICIARIES IS THAT SOMEHOW THE OTHER FIFTEEN SENATORS DIDN'T MANAGE TO GET THEIR NAMES ON THE ROLL CALL
467c030f MR. ZINN SAID ENTERTAINMENT MARKETING IS STILL WEIGHING A PROXY FIGHT
467c030g IT'S A BAD FEELING IN YOUR STOMACH WHEN THE CHAIRMAN AND PREVIOUS BIDDER IS SELLING HIS BLOCK HE SAID
467c030h IT DOESN'T MAKE ME AS A SHAREHOLDER COMFORTABLE WITH WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE COMPANY
467c030i UNDER THE PLAN THE EDELMAN GROUP WOULD CONTRIBUTE ABOUT ONE HUNDRED MILLION IN EQUITY TO THE TRANSACTION
467c030j THE REMAINDER WOULD BE FINANCED WITH DEBT AND DEBT SECURITIES
467c030k IF THE PLAN SUCCEEDS SHEARSON WOULD BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE WARRANTS TO BUY TEN PERCENT TO TWENTY PERCENT OF THE FULLY DILUTED COMMON EQUITY OF THE COMPANY

467c030p WHILE CHRONICLING THE DOINGS OF THE HIGHFALUTIN MAY SEEM LIGHT STUFF TO ME MR. REVSON SAYS HIS OWN APPROACH TO THE SUBJECT MATTER ISN'T
467c030q IT ISN'T JUST THROWING TOGETHER A STRING OF NAMES AND SAYING THEY SIPPED CHAMPAGNE ATE CAVIAR AND WORE BILL BLASS THE COLUMNIST SAYS

467c030z BUT OTHER EVIDENCE ON THE FLAPS IS CONFLICTING
467c0310 <NOISE> ONE OF THE CREW MEMBERS CAN BE HEARD ON A COCKPIT VOICE RECORDER CALLING OUT FLAPS FIFTEEN FIFTEEN THE CORRECT POSITION FOR THE FLAPS
467c0311 <NOISE> AND THE RECORDER INDICATES THAT A COCKPIT ALARM THAT SHOULD HAVE ALERTED THE CREW TO IMPROPERLY SET FLAPS DIDN'T GO OFF
467c0312 WHEN THE HOUSE AND SENATE APPROVED THE TAX BILL EARLY SATURDAY LAWMAKERS DIDN'T MENTION THE LAST MINUTE PROVISIONS AND CONGRESSIONAL STAFFERS DESCRIBED THEM AS TECHNICAL
467c0313 WHILE THE ESTIMATED REVENUE OF ALMOST ONE HUNDRED MILLION OVER THREE YEARS IS RELATIVELY SMALL THE PROVISIONS MIGHT BE PERCEIVED AS AN ANTI TAKEOVER PUSH BY CONGRESS
467c0314 THEY COULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF SLOWING CERTAIN TAKEOVER ACTIVITY CONGRESSIONAL SOURCES ACKNOWLEDGED OVER THE WEEKEND
467c0315 TO BE SURE THE DEFICIT HAS DECLINED IN THE PAST FEW YEARS
467c0316 BUT THAT DECLINE IS ENTIRELY THE RESULT OF A RISING SURPLUS IN THE SOCIAL SECURITY TRUST FUND
467c0317 THAT MONEY SHOULD BE INVESTED TO HELP DEFRAY THE FUTURE RETIREMENT COSTS OF THE BABY BOOMERS INSTEAD IT IS BEING USED TO PAPER OVER THE DEFICIT
467c0318 THAT'S YET ANOTHER SYMPTOM OF MR. DARMAN'S NATIONAL NOW NOW ISM
467c0319 THIS YEAR THE SOVIETS HAVE MOVED COMMERCIAL SALES TO THE FRONT BURNER
467c031a THE EXPORT ARM OF THE SOVIET MINISTRY OF AVIATION INDUSTRY HOPES TO DOUBLE ITS REVENUE BY THE MID NINETEEN NINETIES
467c031b BUT SUCH A SHIFT WOULD BRING MAJOR UPHEAVALS TO THE SOVIET SYSTEM
467c031c ORDERS FOR MILITARY AIRCRAFT HAVE FALLEN TWENTY PERCENT IN THE PAST TWO YEARS ACCORDING TO SOME ESTIMATES

467c0402 IN A NARROWLY DRAWN STATEMENT VICE CHAIRMAN HERBERT FREIMAN DENIED SHEARSON HAD OFFERED A BLOCK TO SALOMON BROTHERS WHICH MANAGED THE SELLING BROKERS' FLOOR OPERATION
467c0403 MR. FREIMAN WOULDN'T ELABORATE
467c0404 THAT MAY BE BUT THERE ARE TOUGH CALLS
467c0405 EMOTIONAL UPSET HEADACHES BACKACHES AND OTHER SUBJECTIVE SYMPTOMS ARE HARD TO QUANTIFY
467c0406 *BESIDES* SOMEONE WHO TRULY FEELS DISABLED MAY AS A RESULT ACTUALLY BE DISABLED
467c0407 A WELL TIMED PERIOD OF TIME OFF WITH STRESS REDUCTION AND AN EFFORT AT BETTER UNDERSTANDING MAY PREVENT A MUCH WORSE DISABILITY LATER
467c0408 IT MAY ALSO UNCOVER FACTORS AT THE WORKPLACE THAT CAN BE IMPROVED
467c0409 I TRY TO GIVE THE PATIENT THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT WITHIN REASON
467c040a NOT DOING SO IS MORE THAN UNKIND IT RISKS HARM TO THE PATIENT AND LAWSUITS THAT NEITHER THE PHYSICIAN NOR EMPLOYER WOULD WELCOME
467c040b BUT SOME FIND ELECTRONIC INVESTING ISN'T WORTH THE TROUBLE
467c040c <NOISE> MR. JEFFERS ESTIMATES THAT A THIRD OF INVESTMENT SOFTWARE BUYERS EVENTUALLY JUNK THEIR PURCHASES BECAUSE THE TECHNOLOGY BAFFLES THEM
467c040d AND WHILE SOME INVESTORS SAY COMPUTERS HAVE MADE THEM MONEY OTHERS HAVE SQUANDERED SMALL FORTUNES BECAUSE THEY RELIED TOO HEAVILY ON TECHNOLOGY

467c040n HE SAID YOU'RE A FREE AGENT GARMENT
467c040o DO WHAT YOU THINK IS APPROPRIATE
467c040p THE HUGE GAP TO A LARGE EXTENT IS A PRICE PHENOMENON
467c040q THE DOLLAR'S FALL HAS PUSHED UP THE PRICE OF IMPORTS CAUSING THE DEFICIT TO SWELL EVEN AS THE VOLUME OF NON OIL IMPORTS HAS RECEDED

467c0415 DANIEL J. GILMARTIN WAS NAMED PRESIDENT AND CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER OF FRANK'S NURSERY AND CRAFTS DETROIT A UNIT OF THIS SPECIALTY RETAILER
467c0416 THE POSTS HAD BEEN VACANT SINCE EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
467c0417 MR. GILMARTIN HAD BEEN DIRECTOR CORPORATE PLANNING FOR THE PARENT COMPANY
467c0418 THEN IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR NATIONAL UNION JOINED THE MARKET
467c0419 ITS POLICY FOR STATE JUDGES THE BIGGEST CLIENTS COSTS EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR FOR A ONE MILLION DOLLAR POLICY WITH NO DEDUCTIBLE
467c041a THE JUDGES ARE COVERED FOR ACTS ERRORS OR OMISSIONS IN THE PERFORMANCE OF PROFESSIONAL DUTIES MR. BOLEN SAYS
468c0201 MORE TRADITIONAL ACADEMICS SAY MANY OF THE NEWER JOURNALS ARE MERELY PLATFORMS FOR MARGINAL SCHOLARS TO WRITE ON TRIVIAL TOPICS
468c0202 I'M DIMLY AWARE THAT THEY'RE OUT THERE SAYS RICHARD ULLMAN PROFESSOR OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS AT PRINCETON UNIVERSITY AND A FORMER EDITOR OF FOREIGN POLICY MAGAZINE
468c0203 BUT I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT PEOPLE WHO PUBLISH SOMETHING THAT'S IMPORTANT WOULDN'T WANT TO PUBLISH IN THE LEADING JOURNALS
468c0204 THE UTILITY WILL BEGIN PAYING INTEREST IN CASH AFTER SEABROOK GOES INTO SERVICE MR. BAYLESS SAID
468c0205 MR. HARRISON SAID THE COMPANY DOESN'T KNOW HOW LONG IT WILL TAKE TO LEAP THE POLITICAL HURDLES THAT ARE BLOCKING SEABROOK
468c0206 BUT THE FINANCIAL RESTRUCTURING IS INTENDED TO KEEP THE COMPANY GOING WITHOUT ADDITIONAL BORROWING UNTIL NINETEEN NINETY OR NINETEEN NINETY ONE HE SAID
468c0207 ANALYSTS ALSO SAID THEY HADN'T EXPECTED LOWER OPERATING PROFITS FOR THE COMPANY'S INDUSTRIES GROUP AND FOR THE BROADCASTING SEGMENT
468c0208 WESTINGHOUSE OFFICIALS TOLD ANALYSTS THAT OPERATING PROFIT IN THE INDUSTRIES GROUP FELL FIFTEEN PERCENT TO TWENTY PERCENT HURT IN PART BY WEAK RESULTS IN CANADIAN OPERATIONS
468c0209 A SHARP DROP IN OPERATING PROFIT FROM THE BROADCASTING GROUP'S PRODUCTION COMPANY CONTRIBUTED TO THE SLIGHTLY LOWER OPERATING EARNINGS OVERALL FOR THAT SEGMENT
468c020a KEMP'S CAMPAIGN TAKES ON AN INCREASINGLY DESPERATE TONE
468c020b IN ONE SURE SIGN OF A CANDIDACY IN TROUBLE HE LASHES OUT AT CRITICISM FROM A LIGHTLY REGARDED T. V. COMMENTATOR
468c020c EVEN SOME SUPPORTERS NOW SAY PRIVATELY THAT HE SHOULD AIM FOR THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION
468c020d BUT HIS LONGTIME HOSTILITIES WITH DOLE LEAVE A SPOT ON A BUSH TICKET AS ABOUT THE ONLY POSSIBILITY
468c020e THOSE LANDS HAVE BECOME WORTH MUCH MORE THAN THE TRANSPORTATION AND ENERGY CONCERN NEEDS FOR THE RAILROAD AND THE COMPANY HAD BEEN TRYING TO FREE ITSELF FROM THE LIENS
468c020f LAST SPRING BURLINGTON AGREED TO PAY REMAINING BONDHOLDERS A TOTAL OF THIRTY FIVE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN RETURN FOR PERMISSION TO REMOVE THE COVENANTS

468c020i ON A PER TON BASIS PRETAX PROFIT DOUBLED TO ABOUT THIRTY SIX DOLLARS FROM EIGHTEEN DOLLARS IN THE THIRD QUARTER
468c020j HOWEVER THE PERFORMANCE FELL FAR SHORT OF U. S. X. CHAIRMAN DAVID R- RODERICK'S PREDICTION OF FIFTY DOLLARS PLUS PER TON PROFIT
468c020k TEXAS OF COURSE IS WHERE THE MOST TROUBLE IS TO BE FOUND
468c020l LENDERS THERE LIKE TO BLAME THE SO CALLED OIL PATCH RECESSION
468c020m BUT THE PROBLEM IN FACT IS BAD BANKING IN A FEW CASES EVEN CORRUPT BANKING
468c020n SOME PARTS OF TEXAS THE DALLAS FORT
468c020o WORTH AREA FOR EXAMPLE HAVEN'T HAD ANYTHING THAT LEGITIMATELY COULD BE CALLED A RECESSION
468c020p THE MAIN REASON SO MANY LENDERS ARE IN TROUBLE IS AN OLD FASHIONED FAILING AMONG BANKERS A WEAKNESS FOR REAL ESTATE SPECULATION
468c020q AS A RESULT THE GOVERNMENT IS TALKING OF HIGHER FARM PRICES
468c020r BUT HIGHER FARM PRICES WOULD ADD TO AN ALREADY STEEP INFLATION RATE
468c020s SO BEIJING OFFICIALS REPORTEDLY TALK OF TYING WAGES TO INFLATION AN IDEA REMINISCENT OF THE WAGE INDEXATION TRIED IN SOME LATIN AMERICAN NATIONS SEVERAL YEARS AGO WITH DISASTROUS RESULTS
468c020t SECRETARIES ARE ALSO EASY TARGETS FOR A HUG ESPECIALLY IN HOLLYWOOD
468c020u I'VE SEEN A WRITER WALK INTO AN OFFICE AND PULL A SECRETARY UP AGAINST HIM
468c020v SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO SAYS CHARLES FRIES CHAIRMAN OF FRIES ENTERTAINMENT INCORPORATED
468c020w NOT TO WORRY SAYS H. FLINT RANNEY A LOCAL REAL ESTATE AGENT
468c020x WE HAVE A GREAT SENSE OF HUMOR HE SAYS
468c020y WE'LL TAKE ALMOST ANYTHING
468c020z BESIDES HE ADDS NEW YORKERS COME HERE ALL THE TIME WE (PARENTHESES JUST )UN-PARENTHESES WOULDN'T WANT THEM TO LIVE HERE
468c0210 ONE BIG PLAY LAST YEAR WAS LEISURE
468c0211 ANOTHER WAS UNDERVALUED ASSETS EVEN THOUGH NO ONE CAN RECALL A JAPANESE COMPANY BEING BROKEN UP FOR ITS ASSETS
468c0212 ONCE YOU GET THAT THEME THE LEVEL OF THE P. E. RATIO DOESN'T MEAN A DAMN SAYS MR. ROBINS
468c0213 IT'S ALL A BIT OF A MIRAGE
468c0214 YET ONE THAT SO FAR HAS WORKED
468c0215 BUT OTHER EVIDENCE ON THE FLAPS IS CONFLICTING
468c0216 ONE OF THE CREW MEMBERS CAN BE HEARD ON THE COCKPIT VOICE RECORDER CALLING OUT FLAPS FIFTEEN FIFTEEN THE CORRECT POSITION FOR THE FLAPS
468c0217 AND THE RECORDER INDICATES THAT A COCKPIT ALARM THAT SHOULD HAVE ALERTED THE CREW TO IMPROPERLY SET FLAPS DIDN'T GO OFF
468c0218 WHAT BOTHERS THESE PEOPLE IS NOT THAT MRS. THATCHER POSES A DANGER TO THE SO CALLED UNIFIED EUROPEAN MARKET
468c0219 MRS. THATCHER IS NOT OPPOSED TO THIS
468c021a BRITAIN'S OWN MARKETS ARE MORE OPEN THAN THOSE OF MOST EUROPEAN COUNTRIES LONDON IS WAY AHEAD OF THEM ON CAPITAL MOVEMENT HAVING ABOLISHED EXCHANGE CONTROLS ALTOGETHER
468c021b THE CAUSE OF THE OUTRAGE IS THAT EUROPEAN UNITY IS THE DEVICE THROUGH WHICH THE REGULATORS AND SOCIALISTS HOPE TO EXPAND THEIR GRIP ON THE CONTINENT
468c021c NOW HIS LAUGHTER IS GONE
468c021d BECAUSE OF DRUGS HE IS DEAD
468c021e AND EVERY DAY MY HEART BREAKS A LITTLE MORE
468c021f ON THE SURFACE THE TRADE REPORT LOOKED ENCOURAGING
468c021g THE NATION'S SEASONALLY ADJUSTED TRADE DEFICIT NARROWED TO EIGHT POINT SEVENTEEN BILLION DOLLARS IN JUNE THE LOWEST MONTHLY DEFICIT SINCE DECEMBER NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR
468c021h WHAT'S MORE THE MAY TRADE DEFICIT WAS REVISED DOWN TO TEN POINT OH TWO BILLION DOLLARS FROM THE TEN POINT TWENTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS ORIGINALLY REPORTED
468c0301 SO FAR ILLEGAL FOREIGN WORKERS AREN'T TAKEN AS A JOB THREAT BY JAPANESE WORKERS
468c0302 BUT JAPANESE UNEMPLOYMENT IS AT HISTORICALLY HIGH LEVELS BECAUSE OF THE YEN'S STRENGTH POSING A KNOTTY PROBLEM FOR THE GOVERNMENT
468c0303 MANY JAPANESE COMPANIES IN SUCH INDUSTRIES AS STEEL AND SHIPBUILDING ARE CUTTING THEIR LABOR FORCES
468c0304 IN THE PAST FILIPINOS IN MANY RURAL AREAS PREFERRED THE DISCIPLINED TERROR OF THE N. P. A. TO THE RANDOM EXCESSES OF THE COUNTRY'S MILITARY
468c0305 WITH THE CHANGE OF GOVERNMENT LAST YEAR A MILD IMPROVEMENT IN MILITARY BEHAVIOR AND THE DETECTION OF THE MINDANAO SLAUGHTERS SOME FILIPINOS ARE CHANGING THEIR MINDS
468c0306 DIPLOMATS AND POLITICAL ANALYSTS SAY THEY DON'T KNOW IF THE TREND PRESAGES SIGNIFICANT POPULAR RESISTANCE TO THE COMMUNISTS OR JUST ADDITIONAL TURMOIL IN THE PHILIPPINE COUNTRYSIDE
468c0307 THERE IS A WIDE VARIATION IN THINKING ABOUT HOW SICK ONE IS AND HOW IMPORTANT TIME OFF IS IN ORDER TO GET WELL
468c0308 THE PATIENTS' RESPONSIBILITIES OUTSIDE OF WORK ALSO VARY
468c0309 IT'S HARD TO SAY TO WHAT DEGREE THESE FACTORS SHOULD INFLUENCE DISABILITY STATUS
468c030a MOST PHYSICIANS PROBABLY CONSIDER THEM IMPORTANT
468c030b IN CLEVELAND HIGBEE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER ROBERT BROADBENT SAYS THE RETAILER HAS BENEFITED FROM ITS PARENT'S FINANCIAL EXPERTISE
468c030c ALTHOUGH IT WILL RETAIN CONTROL INDUSTRY EQUITY IS PLANNING TO TAKE HIGBEE PUBLIC AGAIN PROBABLY IN JUNE
468c030d MEANWHILE SAYS MR. BROADBENT THEY'VE MADE US MORE INQUISITIVE ABOUT ACQUISITIONS OURSELVES
468c030e THE LOAN IS PART OF A SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR PLAN TO EXPAND THE MINE'S RESERVES AND ALLOW IT TO KEEP OPERATING UNTIL NINETEEN NINETY FOUR
468c030f WITHOUT THE EXPANSION THE MINE WAS THREATENED WITH CLOSURE NEXT YEAR
468c030g CLOSURE WOULD MEAN THE LOSS OF SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN JOBS
468c030h ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS ARE CONCERNED BY INTELLIGENCE REPORTS THAT SUGGEST IRAN IS THINKING ABOUT ORGANIZING TERRORIST STRIKES AGAINST AMERICAN WEST EUROPEAN AND ARAB TARGETS
468c030i THE ADMINISTRATION HAS *ALERTED* EMBASSIES AND MILITARY BASES OF AN INCREASED THREAT
468c030j ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS SAY INTELLIGENCE ALSO SHOWS THAT IRAN HAS LAID THE GROUNDWORK FOR TERRORISM IN THE U. S.
468c030k WITHIN AN HOUR BARCLAYS P. L. C. LLOYDS BANK P. L. C. AND THE LONDON UNIT OF CITICORP INCREASED THEIR BASE RATES
468c030l THE BARCLAYS BOOST TOOK EFFECT IMMEDIATELY WHILE THE OTHER TWO BANKS' MOVES WERE EFFECTIVE AT THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS
468c030m SIMILAR INCREASES BY NATIONAL WESTMINSTER BANK P. L. C. AND MIDLAND BANK P. L. C. GO INTO EFFECT TODAY
468c030n BASE RATES ARE THE BENCHMARK FOR COMMERCIAL LENDING IN BRITAIN
468c030o THE FOLLOWING OFFICERS DIRECTORS AND LARGE STOCKHOLDERS OF COMPANIES REPORTED CHANGES IN HOLDINGS UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF NINETEEN THIRTY FOUR
468c030p THOSE IDENTIFIED AS BENEFICIAL OWNERS HOLD AT LEAST TEN PERCENT OF A COMPANY'S EQUITY SECURITIES
468c030q UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED CHANGES INVOLVED DIRECT HOLDINGS OF A COMMON STOCK AND TOOK PLACE IN MAY NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT
468c030r COMPANIES ARE LISTED WHERE TRANSACTIONS GENERALLY AGGREGATE TEN THOUSAND SHARES OR ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS
468c030s ANOTHER CONDITION IS THAT TOPEKA GROUP A UNIT OF DULUTH MINNESOTA BASED MINNESOTA POWER AND LIGHT COMPANY EXERCISE ITS OPTION TO BUY DELTONA'S UTILITY *SUBSIDIARIES*
468c030t BASED ON CURRENT BOOK VALUE THE SUBSIDIARIES WOULD FETCH THIRTY TWO POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN CASH PLUS PREFERRED STOCK IN ONE OF THE UTILITY UNITS
468c030u TOPEKA SAID IT INTENDS TO EXERCISE THE OPTION
468c030v THE BIGGEST HURDLE WAS TO FIND THE FUNDS TO MEET THE COST OF RECONSTRUCTION INCLUSIVE OF THE ISSUE OF STAMPS
468c030w HOWEVER THE RESPONSE TO THE GOVERNMENT'S INTERNATIONAL APPEAL FOR ASSISTANCE HAS BEEN EXTREMELY HEARTWARMING
468c030x THE FUNDS REQUIRED FOR PUBLIC SECTOR ASSISTANCE HAVE BEEN REALIZED AND THE FURTHER AMOUNT REQUIRED IS EXPECTED TO FLOW FROM THE PROCEEDS OF OVERSEAS REINSURANCE OF PROPERTY DAMAGE
468c030y TO BEGIN WITH COMPANIES HAVE BEEN DOING A GOOD JOB OF MANAGING INVENTORIES
468c030z IN THE PAST BUSINESSES HAVE TENDED TO BECOME INCREASINGLY OPTIMISTIC AS EXPANSIONS PERSISTED
468c0310 WHEN SALES EVENTUALLY SLOWED INVENTORIES QUICKLY REACHED EXCESSIVE LEVELS
468c0311 COMPANIES THEREUPON CUT THEIR BUYING INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION DECLINED AND A RECESSION WAS UNDER WAY
468c0312 THIRTY ONE TEAMS OF NINETEEN REPRESENTING BUSINESSES SCHOOLS AND ASSORTED OTHER GROUPS SIGNED UP FOR THE FIRST LOCAL COMPETITION
468c0313 FOR WEEKS DRUMS WERE HEARD ALONG THE WILLAMETTE AS TEAMS PRACTICED
468c0314 BOATS FULL OF MEN AND WOMEN IN BUSINESS SUITS FRESH FROM WORK OR HAPPY HOUR WERE NOT AN UNCOMMON SIGHT
468c0315 THESE MIXED FEELINGS OF FRUSTRATION WITH AND GRATITUDE TOWARD THE AUTHORITIES ARE PART OF THE EVERYDAY LIFE OF A FOREIGNER DOING BUSINESS IN KOREA
468c0316 IN FACT SUCH CONTRADICTIONS ARE WHAT SEEM TO MAKE THE KOREAN WORLD GO ROUND
468c0317 A WESTERN BUSINESSMAN NEEDS TO BE READY FOR THEM
468c0318 HERE ARE A FEW HARD LEARNED FACTS OF KOREAN BUSINESS LIFE
468c0319 BUT MANY LOCAL BUSINESSES THAT DEPEND ON TOURISM AREN'T CONVINCED
468c031a THEY ARGUE THAT A COMMERCIAL MINE MIGHT GET PLAYED OUT IN A FEW YEARS
468c031b AND THEY FEAR THAT MANY TOURISTS WHO TREK HERE FOR THE TANTALIZING PROSPECT OF FINDING A DIAMOND IN THE FIELD WILL TAKE THEIR VACATIONS ELSEWHERE
468c0401 THE COURT WAS SPLIT ON BOTH THE WILLIAMS ACT AND COMMERCE CLAUSE
468c0402 JUSTICE LEWIS POWELL ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO CASE OF EDGAR VERSUS
468c0403 M. I. T. E. SUGGESTED THAT ANY STATE LAW THAT FAVORED TARGETS MORE THAN DID THE WILLIAMS ACT WOULD BE INVALID BECAUSE CONGRESS HAD PREEMPTED LOCAL REGULATIONS
468c0404 THE COURT BACKTRACKED HERE TO SAY STATE LAWS MIGHT BE O. K. IF THEY HELP THE WILLIAMS ACT'S PURPOSE BY HEAPING EVEN MORE BURDENS ON ACQUIRERS
468c0405 IT HAS RELIEVED AT LEAST SOME OF THE FRUSTRATION FELT BY THE FARMERS SAYS PETER BRENT A MEMBER OF A FARM ACTIVIST GROUP
468c0406 IF THEY GO TO MEDIATION AT LEAST THE LENDER HAS TO LISTEN
468c0407 NEARLY A DOZEN OTHER STATES HAVE INQUIRED INTO IOWA'S PROGRAM
468c0408 AND MANDATORY MEDIATION MODELED ON IOWA'S PROGRAM IS CURRENTLY BEING CONSIDERED BY THE CALIFORNIA AND MISSOURI LEGISLATURES
468c0409 OGILVY IS THE NATION'S FIFTH LARGEST ADVERTISING AGENCY WITH NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX BILLINGS OF THREE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS
468c040a ROUGHLY HALF OF THOSE BILLINGS CAME FROM OUTSIDE THE U. S. MR. ROMAN SAID
468c040b AGENCIES TRADITIONALLY HAVE TAKEN FIFTEEN PERCENT OF BILLINGS AS A COMMISSION
468c040c L. T. V. HAS SAID REPEATEDLY SINCE ITS FILING THAT IT WOULD FIGHT ANY CREDITOR MOVE TO EITHER REORGANIZE THE UNIT SEPARATELY OR FORCE ITS SALE
468c040d CREDITORS ON THE OTHER HAND HAVE DISCUSSED THE IDEA ALMOST SINCE THE DAY OF L. T. V.'S FILING
468c040e AND THE PENSION AGENCY THE BANKS AND THE COMMITTEE REPRESENTING UNSECURED CREDITORS HAVE RECENTLY BEEN HOLDING SERIOUS DISCUSSIONS ON THE ISSUE
468c040f IN REACTION TO THE NEWS INTEREST RATES PLUNGED THE AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR FIRMED AND ANALYSTS PREDICTED STOCKS WOULD MOVE HIGHER
468c040g BUT WHILE THE BUDGET GAVE A BOOST TO THE MARKETS IT ALSO PRESAGED GREATER AUSTERITY FOR THE NATION AS A WHOLE
468c040h TO MR. HAWKE THAT IS AS IT SHOULD BE
468c040i AUSTRALIANS HAVE GOT TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE AREN'T OUT OF THE WOODS YET HE SAYS
468c040j WE'VE GOT ENORMOUS PROBLEMS AND WE HAVE TO LEARN TO LIVE WITHIN OUR RESOURCES
468c040k DESPITE ALL THE UNCERTAINTY THAT SURROUNDED BRITISH PETROLEUM'S JUMBO OFFERING THERE WASN'T THAT MUCH TURMOIL IN THE MARKET WHEN SHARES BEGAN TO TRADE FRIDAY
468c040l B. P.'S PARTIALLY PAID AMERICAN DEP:OSITORY SHARES CLOSED UNCHANGED AT SEVENTEEN AND A QUARTER WITH THIRTEEN POINT TWO MILLION TRADED
468c040m IT WAS THE BIG BOARD'S MOST ACTIVE ISSUE
468c040n THE ROLLBACKS COULD BE UNEXPECTEDLY PAINFUL FOR SOME HOURLY WORKERS
468c040o CHRYSLER'S UNEMPLOYMENT FUND HAS BEEN DRAINED TO THE POINT THAT BENEFITS ARE ALREADY BEING REDUCED A U. A. W. SPOKESMAN SAID
468c040p THE FUND HAS AT LEAST IN PART BEEN DRAINED BY WORKERS TEMPORARILY LAID OFF WHEN PLANTS WERE CLOSED DOWN FOR RETOOLING
468c040q HERE ARE PRICE TRENDS ON THE WORLD'S MAJOR STOCK MARKETS AS CALCULATED BY MORGAN STANLEY CAPITAL INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE GENEVA
468c040r TO MAKE THEM DIRECTLY COMPARABLE EACH INDEX IS BASED ON THE CLOSE OF NINETEEN SIXTY NINE EQUALING ONE HUNDRED
468c040s THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE IS SINCE YEAR END
468c040t WE WANT MORE INSTITUTIONAL ASSETS SAYS A KEMPER SPOKESWOMAN
468c040u WE THINK THE BUSINESS HOLDS CONSIDERABLE PROMISE FOR THE FUTURE SHE ADDS AND WE THINK CITICORP IS A CAPABLE ORGANIZATION
468c040v OTHERS SAY INSTITUTIONAL ASSET MANAGEMENT STILL IS CONSIDERED A GOOD BUSINESS DESPITE RELATIVELY LOW FEES AND SIGNS OF SLOW GROWTH
468c040w FIRST BOSTON AND XEROX HAD NO COMMENT
468c040x THE CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER WOULD HAVE BOTH THE FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL BUSINESSES REPORTING TO HIM
468c040y MR. SHELTON HAD LED AN IMPROVED PERFORMANCE OF THE LATTER DURING THE PAST TWO YEARS
468c040z HE ALSO HAS A LONGER TERM RELATIONSHIP WITH COMPANY CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER WILLIAM S. WIRE THE SECOND WORKING FOR GENESCO SINCE NINETEEN FIFTY SIX
468c0410 FARM FUTURES PRICES HAVE FALLEN SEVERAL TIMES IN THE PAST TWO WEEKS FOLLOWING SEVERAL WEEKS OF A DROUGHT INSPIRED RALLY
468c0411 YESTERDAY'S TRADING SEEMED TO SUPPORT THE NOTION AMONG SOME ANALYSTS THAT CORN AND WHEAT FUTURES ARE TOP HEAVY
468c0412 THE MARKET HAS BEEN OVERDONE SIGNIFICANTLY ON THE UPSIDE SAID RICHARD LOEWY SENIOR GRAIN AND OIL SEED ANALYST WITH PRUDENTIAL BACHE SECURITIES INCORPORATED
468c0413 THE PIPER HAS TO BE PAID ON THE OTHER SIDE
468c0414 ONE OF THE FOUR BUSINESSES INCLUDED IN THE LOCKUP OPTION GRANTED TO K. K. R. IS MACMILLAN'S DIRECTORY DIVISION WHICH CONSISTS OF WHO'S WHO AND A NATIONAL REGISTER PUBLISHING
468c0415 THUS IT WASN'T IMMEDIATELY CLEAR WHY INTERNATIONAL THOMSON MIGHT BE LOOKING AT THE OPERATION EVEN THOUGH IT IS INCLUDED IN THE LOCKUP OPTION
468c0416 A SPOKESMAN FOR K. K. R. ALSO DECLINED COMMENT
468c0417 THE DECISION FREES INTERIOR OFFICIALS TO FORMALLY OPEN OIL COMPANY BIDS TO LEASE UP TO FIVE POINT SIX MILLION ACRES IN A SALMON RICH AREA NEAR THE BERING SEA
468c0418 THE GOVERNMENT SOLICITED BIDS FOR THE SALE IN JANUARY NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX BUT UNTIL NOW HAS BEEN BARRED BY COURT ORDER FROM OPENING THEM
468c0419 OFFICIALS SAID THE BIDS WOULD BE OPENED IN ANCHORAGE ALASKA TUESDAY
468c041a TO BE SURE ON A LOT OF SCORES THE SUMMIT WAS A SUCCESS
468c041b ECONOMIC COOPERATION WAS ADVANCED WITH BUSINESSMEN SIGNING AGREEMENTS FOR ABOUT THIRTY CONTRACTS WITH SEVERAL JOINT VENTURES
468c041c HUMAN RIGHTS TOO MAY HAVE TAKEN A STEP FORWARD IF MR. GORBACHEV LIVES UP TO HIS PROMISE TO RELEASE ALL POLITICAL PRISONERS BY YEAR'S END
468c041d IN EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT THE POLITICAL SETTLEMENT ENVISAG:ED BY THE NON COMMUNISTS SEEMED PLAUSIBLE
468c041e SOVIET LEADER MIKHAIL GORBACHEV WAS A MAJOR REASON
468c041f MR. GORBACHEV SAW THE EXPANSIONIST AMBITIONS OF HIS PREDECESSORS STYMIED BY THE RESOLUTE CONTAINMENT POLICY OF BOTH CHINA AND THE PRO WESTERN A. S. E. A. N. POWERS
468c041g SUPPORT FOR THE VIETNAMESE OCCUPATION OF CAMBODIA COST THE SOVIET UNION ECONOMICALLY AND DIPLOMATICALLY
468c041h SO THE SOVIETS TRYING TO ELIMINATE THE MILITARY QUAGMIRE IN CAMBODIA PERSUADED HANOI'S LEADERS TO NEGOTIATE A MILITARY WITHDRAWAL FROM CAMBODIA
469c0201 LAST WEEK THERE WERE REPORTS AFTER THE OFFERING SHEARSON LEHMAN HAD A BIG UNSOLD CHUNK OF STOCK
469c0202 IN A NARROWLY DRAWN STATEMENT VICE CHAIRMAN HERBERT FREIMAN DENIED SHEARSON HAD OFFERED A BLOCK TO SALOMON BROTHERS WHICH MANAGED THE SELLING BROKERS' FLOOR OPERATION
469c0203 MR. FREIMAN WOULDN'T ELABORATE
469c0204 THE SWISS FRANC BOND MARKET MEANWHILE REMAINED LISTLESS DESPITE A SHARP FALL IN THE DOLLAR
469c0205 MOST PRICES WERE UNCHANGED WITH AVERAGE TURNOVER TRADERS SAID
469c0206 ONE GENEVA TRADER SAID INVESTORS WERE STAYING OUT OF THE MARKET BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE THE BOTTOM IS IN THE DOLLAR'S CURRENT DECLINE
469c0207 CLOSELY HELD TRANSAMERICAN SAID IT ALSO AGREED TO SETTLE A DISPUTE WITH ANOTHER CREDITOR MEDALLION OIL COMPANY
469c0208 THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENTS WHICH MUST BE APPROVED BY THE BANKRUPTCY COURT WOULD REMOVE TWO MAJOR HURDLES IN TRANSAMERICAN'S LONG STRUGGLE TO GET OUT OF THE CHAPTER ELEVEN PROCEEDINGS
469c0209 TRANSAMERICA FILED FOR COURT PROTECTION FROM CREDITORS IN JANUARY NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE WHEN IT WAS MIRED IN ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF DEBT
469c020a I RECEIVED WELFARE FOR EIGHT MONTHS AFTER MY SECOND CHILD WAS BORN
469c020b LUCKILY I WAS ABLE WITH THE HELP OF MY FAMILY TO GET A GOOD JOB AND RELIABLE CHILD CARE
469c020c BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF WELFARE MOTHERS OUT THERE WHO AREN'T THIS FORTUNATE
469c020d A LOT OF WOMEN DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET JOBS OR THE TRAINING NEEDED TO GET ONE AND SOMEONE TO WATCH THEIR CHILDREN
469c020e WHEN THAT SITUATION IS RESOLVED THEN YOU WILL SEE A LOT OF FORMER WELFARE RECIPIENTS BECOMING PRODUCTIVE MEMBERS OF SOCIETY
469c020f THE SUN BELT FORECAST PARTLY CLOUDY
469c020g ECONOMISTS EXPECT THE SOUTHEAST BUFFERED BY ITS BIG SERVICE ECONOMY TO CONTINUE TO OUTPERFORM THE NATION

469c020t THE AGENCY HOPES TO REALIZE ITS TARGET PRICE OF THIRTEEN MILLION
469c020u THUS INSTEAD OF CALMART'S BEING ACQUIRED SELECT ASSETS WOULD BE OPTIONED AND A HUNK OF STOCK WOULD BE RELATIVELY SAFE FROM HANDS
469c020v CALMAT WOULD RID OF MR. BRIERLEY WHO APPEARS TO HAVE TRIED TO PUT THE COMPANY IN PLAY
469c020w INDUSTRIAL EQUITY EXECUTIVES IN CALIFORNIA DIDN'T RETURN CALLS SEEKING COMMENT
469c020x MR. CHATICHAI'S WEALTHY FAMILY BACKGROUND AND HIS FAMILY'S LARGE PROPERTY INTERESTS GIVE HIM A GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY
469c020y FURTHER HE HAS GOOD RELATIONS WITH THE LARGE ETHNIC CHINESE COMMUNITY AND SERVES AS CHAIRMAN OF THE THAI CHINESE FRIENDSHIP ASSOCIATION
469c020z THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE COUNTRY'S BUSINESS ELITE MANY OF WHOM ARE ETHNIC CHINESE
469c0210 HOWEVER CONVENTIONAL FILM WILL BE MARGINALLY PROFITABLE AT BEST FOR POLAROID BECAUSE INITIALLY POLAROID WON'T BE MANUFACTURING THE FILM CONTENDS ELLIOTT NOVAK AN INDUSTRY CONSULTANT
469c0211 INSTEAD IT WILL BUY THE FILM FROM ANOTHER COMPANY AND PUT ITS NAME ON IT JUST AS IT DOES WITH VIDEOTAPE
469c0212 SINCE IT BEGAN SELLING VIDEOTAPE A FEW YEARS AGO POLAROID HAS BUILT UP AN IMPRESSIVE TWELVE PERCENT MARKET SHARE MAKING IT THE LEADER IN THE U. S.
469c0213 BUT FIERCE COMPETITION HAS KEPT VIDEOTAPE PROFITS SLIM AND THE CONVENTIONAL FILM BUSINESS ISN'T LIKELY TO PROVE ANY BONANZA EITHER
469c0214 PETER DAPUZZO HEAD OF RETAIL TRADING AT SHEARSON LEHMAN HUTTON ALSO LOOKS FOR A SHARP UPWARD MOVE IN STOCK PRICES GIVEN A FEW IFS
469c0215 ONE IS IF INVESTORS DON'T GET SPOOKED AT THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE CRASH
469c0216 ANOTHER IS IF THE FEDERAL RESERVE EASES INTEREST RATES
469c0217 AND A THIRD IS IF GEORGE BUSH WINS THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION
469c0218 I DON'T KNOW IF THE PARENTS UNDERSTAND HOW SUBTLE THIS NEW AGE MOVEMENT REALLY IS SHE SAYS
469c0219 THEY DRAW THE KIDS IN WITH FAIRY TALES AND SORCERY
469c021a THEIR ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO DO AWAY WITH ANYBODY WHO BELIEVES THERE IS SUCH THING AS EVIL
469c021b BUT YAMAICHI DENIED THE RUMORS
469c021c THIS MAKES A DOZEN CALLS I'VE HAD ON THIS TODAY SAID AN ANNOYED TRADING OFFICIAL AT YAMAICHI'S NEW YORK BASED U. S. SUBSIDIARY
469c021d HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE FIRM ACTIVELY SOLD S. AND P. FIVE HUNDRED FUTURES LAST WEEK AND THAT DEAN WITTER HANDLED SOME OF THE SALES
469c021e BUT HE ADDED THAT WE HAVEN'T BEEN A HEAVY SELLER AT ALL THIS WEEK
469c0301 THE BROADCASTING PROPERTIES HAVE LONG BEEN REGARDED AS GENCORP'S BEST DEFENSE AGAINST A HOSTILE TAKEOVER
469c0302 <NOISE> LICENSES FOR TWO OF THE TELEVISION STATIONS AND ALL OF THE RADIO STATIONS ARE BEING CHALLENGED BY GROUPS WHO CHARGE THAT GENCORP IS AN UNFIT OPERATOR
469c0303 THE DISPUTE INCLUDES ALLEGATIONS THAT GENCORP FAILED TO *ADEQUATELY* INFORM THE F. C. C. OF ALLEGEDLY IMPROPER CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS AND FOREIGN PAYMENTS
469c0304 THE NEW TAX LAW LIMITS ON RETIREMENT BENEFITS FOR EXECUTIVES SPUR GREATER INTEREST IN CERTAIN TRUSTS THAT HELP SAFEGUARD DEFERRED COMPENSATION UNTIL RETIREMENT TIME
469c0305 SUCH TRUSTS AREN'T COMPLETELY *INVIOLATE* CREDITORS CAN CLAIM THE MONEY AFTER A BANKRUPTCY FOR INSTANCE
469c0306 BUT THEY ARE CONSIDERED BETTER THAN A MERE PROMISE TO THE EXECUTIVE
469c0307 <NOISE> <NOISE> J. W. T. HADN'T YET RESPONDED TO W. P. P.'S WEDNESDAY BID OF FORTY FIVE DOLLARS A SHARE OR ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY MILLION
469c0308 ON FRIDAY W. P. P. LAUNCHED A HOSTILE FORTY FIVE DOLLAR A SHARE TENDER OFFER FOR J. W. T.'S APPROXIMATELY TEN MILLION SHARES OUTSTANDING
469c0309 THAT HOSTILE OFFER FORMALLY REMAINED IN EFFECT DESPITE W. P. P.'S LATEST MOVE
469c030a AT A MEETING WITH ANALYSTS ROBERT M. KAVNER A. T. AND T.'S CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER SAID IT APPEARS WE WILL HAVE A GOOD YEAR
469c030b BUT IN RESPONSE TO AN ANALYST'S QUESTION HE SAID EARNINGS OF TWO DOLLARS A SHARE SOUNDS STRONG
469c030c HE ALSO WARNED ANALYSTS AGAINST LOOKING AT A PARTICULAR QUARTER AND ISOLATING IT ADDING WE ARE LOOKING FOR THE ANNUAL TREND LINE
469c030d THERE'S SOME PAPER OUT FOR BIDS YOU HAVEN'T HEARD ABOUT CADWALLADER BECAUSE YOU DO ONLY DOMESTIC
469c030e COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT BONDS WITH THE COUPON INDEXED TO THE STREET PRICE OF COCAINE
469c030f SOLID INVESTMENT BUT INTRIGUING
469c030g I THINK WE'RE GOING TO SPRING FOR THAT
469c030h WITH A REBOUND IN THE STOCK MARKET INVESTORS' FEARS ABOUT A RECESSION COOLED AND THE BOND MARKET SLUMPED
469c030i A SHARP SLIDE IN THE U. S. DOLLAR ALSO ADDED SOME DOWNWARD PRESSURE TO BOND PRICES
469c030j DESPITE THE DECLINE IN BONDS THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE GOOD ON ITS PROMISE TO PROVIDE AMPLE LIQUIDITY THROUGH ITS OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS
469c030k DESPITE ALL OF THE UNCERTAINTY THAT SURROUNDED BRITISH PETROLEUM'S JUMBO OFFERING THERE WASN'T THAT MUCH TURMOIL IN THE MARKET WHEN SHARES BEGAN TO TRADE FRIDAY
469c030l B. P.'S PARTIALLY PAID AMERICAN DEPOSITARY SHARES CLOSED UNCHANGED AT SEVENTEEN AND A QUARTER WITH THIRTEEN POINT TWO MILLION TRADED
469c030m IT WAS THE BIG BOARD'S MOST ACTIVE ISSUE
469c030n UNTIL NOW *NASDAQ* OR OTHER N. A. S. D.'S AUTOMATED QUOTATION SYSTEMS HAS PROVIDED COMPUTER TERMINALS WITH PRICE QUOTATIONS ON ALL ISSUES
469c030o MOST BIG TRADES HOWEVER ARE NEGOTIATED BY TELEPHONE AND THEN RECORDED IN THE SYSTEM'S COMPUTERS
469c030p ONLY THE SMALL ORDER SYSTEM HAS PROVIDED TRADERS WITH THE ABILITY TO EXECUTE TRADES BY COMPUTER RATHER THAN BY TELEPHONE
469c030q STILL THE COMPANY INSIDERS SAID THE RESTRUCTURING WAS ENTIRELY MR. ASKERS'S PLAN AND WASN'T FORCED ON HIM BY THE I. B. M. BOARD
469c030r A DIRECTOR SAID THE BOARD LEARNED OF THE PLAN AT ITS MEETING LAST TUESDAY
469c030s <NOISE> JOHN FOUND EVERYTHING WAS COMING ONTO HIS DESK AND HE HAD MORE THAN HE COULD COPE WITH ANOTHER DIRECTOR SAID
469c030t HE WANTED AN ORGANIZATION WHICH RESOLVED MORE PROBLEMS BEFORE THEY GOT TO HIM
469c030u THE E. P. A. PROPOSED MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR MUNICIPAL TRASH DUMPS THAT THE AGENCY ESTIMATED WILL COST EIGHT HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR
469c030v THE PROPOSED RULES WOULD REQUIRE ABOUT SIX THOUSAND DUMPS TO INSTALL GROUNDWATER MONITORING SYSTEMS
469c030w THEY WOULD ALSO CLOSE SOME DUMPS AND PUT SPECIAL CONDITIONS ON OTHERS IN CERTAIN AREAS
469c030x HOPING TO PREVENT LONG COSTLY DISPUTES OVER WHAT DOCUMENTS DEFENDANTS HAVE TO SURRENDER JUDGES GRANT BLANKET PROTECTIVE ORDERS

469c0311 THE TWO DIVISIONS TOGETHER ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT EIGHTY MILLION TO NINETY MILLION IN ANNUAL SALES SAID ROBERT L. BERNSTEIN RANDOM HOUSE CHAIRMAN
469c0312 MR. BERNSTEIN NOTED THAT RANDOM HOUSE HAS EXPANDED IN OTHER DIRECTIONS NOTABLY IN TRADE PUBLISHING
469c0313 TRADE BOOKS ARE ALL BOOKS SOLD DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS IN BOOK STORES AND THROUGH MAIL ORDERS
469c0314 ANSWER YES WITHOUT QUESTION
469c0315 IT'S MY SENSE THAT THERE WAS A TIME WHEN PEOPLE THOUGHT THEY COULD TRADE ON INSIDE INFORMATION WITHOUT ABSOLUTE IMPUNITY
469c0316 AND THAT'S NO LONGER TRUE
469c0317 NOW I AM CERTAIN THAT THERE ARE STILL PEOPLE WHO THINK THEY CAN TRADE ON INSIDE INFORMATION AND GET AWAY WITH IT BECAUSE THEY'RE SMARTER THAN THE AVERAGE PERSON
469c0318 THERE WILL ALWAYS BE THOSE PEOPLE
469c0319 BUT I THINK THAT THE ACTIONS HAVE HAD A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON CONDUCT
469c031a THIS GROWING RELIANCE ON THIRD PARTIES TO SELL PRODUCTS COULD HINDER H. P.'S ABILITY TO MANAGE ITS BUSINESS AND MAKE THE COMPANY'S STOCK LESS ATTRACTIVE TO INVESTORS
469c031b YOU BOUGHT H. P. STOCK IN THE PAST BECAUSE IT HAD MORE CONTROL OVER ITS DESTINY THAN OTHER ELECTRONICS FIRMS SAID MR. WU
469c031c TODAY H. P. HAS LESS CONTROL OVER ITS FUTURE

469c0401 THE WORD IS TERROR
469c0402 MY FEAR OF FAILURE MAY BE GREATER IN SOME RESPECTS
469c0403 PEOPLE SAY ADVERSITY IS GOOD FOR YOU
469c0404 WELL THAT'S NOT EXACTLY TRUE
469c0405 I'M NOT THE SAME PERSON I WAS
469c0406 TRADING VOLUME HAS BEEN LETHARGIC FOR THE PAST FEW WEEKS PARTLY REFLECTING CONFUSION ABOUT THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK
469c0407 IMPORTANT CLUES ARE EXPECTED TO EMERGE FRIDAY WHEN THE LABOR DEPARTMENT REPORTS EMPLOYMENT FIGURES FOR FEBRUARY
469c0408 MANY ANALYSTS EXPECT THE STATISTICS TO INDICATE THAT THE ECONOMY REMAINS WEAK AND THAT LOWER INTEREST RATES LIE AHEAD
469c0409 BUT THE EMPLOYMENT STATISTICS ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO PREDICT AND INDIVIDUAL ESTIMATES VARY WIDELY
469c040a BUT SOME INDUSTRY ANALYSTS ARE SKEPTICAL ABOUT S. H. V.'S INTENTIONS
469c040b THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON THERE SAID HUMPHREY HARRISON AN ANALYST AT COUNTY SECURITIES
469c040c I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE END GAME IS BUT I DOUBT THEY S. H. V. WILL REMAIN AT TWENTY EIGHT PERCENT
469c040d MR. REINHARD REMEMBERS AN INDIAN COMMERCIAL TWO YEARS AGO AT THE PRESTIGIOUS CANNES FESTIVAL NO RELATION TO THE FILM FESTIVAL THERE

469c040w NO FINAL BUDGET DECISIONS HAVE BEEN MADE AT THE WHITE HOUSE
469c040x BUDGET DRAFTING IS BEHIND SCHEDULE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES WON'T EVEN SEE O. M. B. RECOMMENDATIONS UNTIL LATE THIS WEEK
469c040y BUT IT'S ALREADY CLEAR THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS INCREASED ITS EMPHASIS ON EDUCATION
469c040z I THINK IT'S A PERFECTLY HONORABLE PROFESSION
469c0410 IF MORE OF US DID IT THE OPPORTUNITIES WOULD GET SMALLER BECAUSE MORE FIRMS WOULD BE COMPETING TO CLOSE THE SAME SPREADS HE SAYS
469c0411 THE PRODUCT IS A LEGITIMATE HEDGING PRODUCT AND A LEGITIMATE WAY TO ADD LIQUIDITY TO THE MARKET
469c0412 REAL ESTATE INDUSTRY SOURCES SAID INTENSE FRICTION BETWEEN *SALVATORE* RATIENI AND MR. DAVIS DEVELOPED DURING THE KIAWAH NEGOTIATIONS

469c0414 A SPOKESMAN FOR MR. DAVIS DIDN'T DISPUTE THE REPORT OF PERSONAL FRICTION
469c0415 BANKS THAT COMMIT TO THE NEW CREDIT BY TODAY GET A FEE EQUAL TO THE THREE POINT SEVEN FIVE PERCENT OF THE AMOUNT THEY COMMIT
469c0416 IT WON'T BE CLEAR UNTIL !AFTER THE WEEKEND HOW MANY COMMITMENTS HAVE BEEN RECEIVED

46cc0218 YET WE PROBABLY HAVE THE LARGEST MANUFACTURING CONSULTING PRACTICE IN THE WORLD
46cc0219 <NOISE> THE REASON FOR THE RELATIVELY MODEST INCENTIVE PROGRAMS IS THAT THE AUTO MAKERS ARE DEMONSTRATING A MUCH BETTER ABILITY TO KEEP PRODUCTION IN LINE WITH SALES
46cc021a INVENTORIES OF U. S. MADE CARS STOOD AT FIFTY NINE DAYS SUPPLY AT THE END OF AUGUST ACCORDING TO WARD'S AUTOMOTIVE REPORTS AN INDUSTRY TRADE PUBLICATION
46cc021b THAT IS CONSIDERED A NORMAL SUPPLY AND IT IS THE LOWEST STOCK IN TWENTY TWO MONTHS
46cc021c NOT ALL BLACK COLLEGES ARE ON THE ROPES
46cc021d IN FACT A NUMBER OF ELITE INSTITUTIONS ARE THRIVING IN PART BECAUSE OF THEIR HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL FUND RAISING EFFORTS
46cc021e LAST WEEK FOR INSTANCE MR. COSBY AND HIS WIFE CAMILLE DONATED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS TO SPELMAN COLLEGE A BLACK WOMEN'S COLLEGE IN ATLANTA
46cc0301 BORG WARNER EASED THREE EIGHTHS TO FORTY ONE AND THREE EIGHTHS ON SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY NINE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SHARES
46cc0302 MINSTAR AND BEAR STEARNS ENTERED INTO AN OPTION AGREEMENT FOR THE POSSIBLE PURCHASE OF THREE MILLION TWENTY NINE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED BORG WARNER SHARES
46cc0303 THE PURCHASES WOULD BOOST MINSTAR'S BORG WARNER STAKE TO EIGHT POINT FIVE PERCENT
46cc0304 YESTERDAY G. A. F. ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAS ACQUIRED A NINE POINT NINE SIX PERCENT INVESTMENT STAKE IN BORG WARNER
46cc0305 <NOISE> LAST MONTH PIEDMONT'S BOARD RECOMMENDED THAT THE COMPANY ACCEPT NORFOLK SOUTHERN'S BID TO ACQUIRE THE COMPANY FOR SIXTY FIVE DOLLARS A SHARE
46cc0306 NORFOLK SOUTHERN HAS A STAKE IN PIEDMONT SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE
46cc0307 BUT ONE DAY AFTER THE BOARD'S RECOMMENDATION U. S. AIR SWEETENED ITS INITIAL BID FOR PIEDMONT FORCING THE BOARD TO DROP ITS RECOMMENDATION
46cc0308 <NOISE> IN FACT GIVEN THE HIGHLY DEVELOPED U. S. TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE FEW IF ANY SHIPPERS ARE TRULY CAPTIVE TO RAILS
46cc0309 THE BEST CASE IS MADE BY ELECTRIC UTILITIES THAT HAVE POWER PLANTS SERVED BY COAL HAULING ROADS BUT BIG UTILITIES DON'T LACK BARGAINING POWER
46cc030a FOR ONE THING THE STAGGERS ACT NOW ALLOWS LONG TERM CONTRACTS BETWEEN SHIPPERS AND RAILROADS
46cc030b <NOISE> THAT INCREDIBLY WAS NOT ALLOWED UNDER THE OLD LAW BECAUSE CONGRESS HAD ONCE DECIDED <NOISE> THAT VOLUME DISCOUNTS TO BIG SHIPPERS WERE UNFAIR
46cc030c IN DRAWING UP CONTRACTS THE RELEVANT FACT IS THAT BOTH THE RAILROAD AND THE UTILITY NEED EACH OTHER
46cc030d SOME UTILITIES PARTICULARLY IN THE WEST HAVE SURPLUS CAPACITY MEANING THEY CAN SWITCH TO OTHER SOURCES IF HAULING COSTS AT A SINGLE PLANT RISE
46cc030e <NOISE> DURING TESTIMONY IN APRIL FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION CHAIRMAN DANIEL OLIVER SAID THE LEGISLATION WOULD RESTRAIN COMPETITION
46cc030f HE ARGUED THAT SELLING DRUGS POSES NO CONFLICT OF INTEREST FOR PHYSICIANS
46cc030g <NOISE> THE COMMISSION ALSO HAS URGED STATE LEGISLATURES TO OPPOSE SIMILAR MEASURES
46cc030h WHEN THE MARKET WAS ROARING IT WAS STUPID TO HAVE CASH SAYS THE FUND MANAGER AT A MAJOR JAPANESE TRUST BANK
46cc030i BUT NOW IT ISN'T SO BAD
46cc030j AND SALOMON'S MR. NAPIER SAYS EVERYONE IS GETTING INTO CASH RIGHT NOW AND WAITING
46cc030k BOND TRADERS ALSO WERE CHEERED BY ANOTHER DROP IN OIL FUTURES PRICES THE SEVENTH DECLINE IN THE PAST EIGHT SESSIONS
46cc030l THE DROP HAS INDICATED TO SOME ANALYSTS THAT INFLATION FEARS WERE GREATLY EXAGGERATED
46cc030m <NOISE> PREVIOUSLY OIL PRICES HAD SURGED ABOVE TWENTY TWO DOLLARS A BARREL LARGELY ON FEAR THAT GROWING TENSION IN THE PERSIAN GULF MIGHT LEAD TO A DISRUPTION OF OIL SUPPLIES
46cc030n IT ALSO INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD OF DEFECTIONS FROM HILL SAMUEL'S ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY MEMBER CORPORATE FINANCE GROUP ACCORDING TO INSIDERS AND OFFICIALS OF OTHER BANKS
46cc030o AS PART OF T. S. B. THE DEPARTMENT MAINLY WOULD SERVE SMALL COMPANIES IN THE UNITED KINGDOM
46cc030p MANY MEMBERS OF THE TEAM HAD SOUGHT AN ALLIANCE WITH A LARGER GLOBAL PARTNER
46cc030q UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE THEY HAD THOUGHT THE OPERATION WOULD BE SOLD TO BARCLAYS BANK P. L. C.
46cc030r <NOISE> PROTESTERS IN BANGLADESH FOUGHT POLICE AND POLITICAL OPPONENTS AFTER VOTING RESUMED IN LOCAL ELECTIONS
46cc030s FOUR PEOPLE WERE REPORTED KILLED AND MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED WERE INJURED
46cc030t THE VOTING FOR LOCAL COUNCIL SEATS BEGAN FEBRUARY THE TENTH BUT ELECTION VIOLENCE KILLED AT LEAST ONE HUNDRED PEOPLE AND OFFICIALS POSTPONED THE BALLOTING
46cc030u VOTING HAD RESUMED ON SATURDAY
46cc030v THE GOVERNMENT IS NOW PORING OVER MR. SEOW'S FINANCIAL AFFAIRS ASKING HOW HE'S BEEN PAYING HIS PHONE BILLS THESE PAST TEN YEARS
46cc030w SIMILAR INQUIRIES LED TO THE EXPULSION FROM PARLIAMENT LAST DECEMBER OF JOSHUA B. JEYARETNAM LEAVING ONLY ONE OPPOSITION M. P.
46cc030x A TEAM CANDIDATE PROPOSAL NOW UNDER STUDY WOULD ALSO SEEM L- LIKELY TO KEEP THE OPPOSITION FROM FINDING ITS WAY INTO GOVERNMENT OFFICE
46cc030y BUT SINGAPORE'S TWO POINT SIX MILLION CITIZENS AREN'T LIKELY TO BENEFIT QUITE SO MUCH AS THE POLITICIANS OF MR. LEE'S RULING PARTY
46cc030z COTTON FUTURES PRICES FOR COTTON FROM THE CURRENT CROP ROSE ON BUYING MOSTLY BY TRADERS WHO FOLLOW CHART SIGNALS
46cc0310 THE ADVANCE IN TURN PULLED UP PRICES F- OF DELIVERY MONTHS REPRESENTING THE NEW CROP SEASON WHICH WILL BEGIN AUGUST THE FIRST
46cc0311 THE JULY DELIVERY ROSE ONE POINT FIVE NINE CENTS A POUND TO SIXTY FOUR POINT FOUR EIGHT CENTS
46cc0312 <NOISE> THE OCTOBER CONTRACT WAS UP POINT FIVE EIGHTHS OF A CENT TO SIXTY POINT THREE SIX CENTS A POUND
46cc0313 ONE ANALYST OBSERVED THAT NEW CROP CONTRACTS WERE UNDER PRESSURE EARLIER IN THE DAY BECAUSE OF THE PERCEPTION THAT MOISTURE IN THE MISSISSIPPI DELTA MIGHT BE HEAVIER THAN NEEDED
46cc0314 BUT LATER IN THE SESSION TRADERS CHANGED THEIR MINDS HE SAID DECIDING THAT RAIN MIGHT NOT BE ADEQUATE
46cc0315 HE SCORED A BIG TRIUMPH EARLY THIS YEAR PUSHING ASIDE LOCAL BUREAUCRATS WHO WANTED TO SHARE HIS SPOILS IN A ONE BILLION DOLLAR FREEWAY BEING BUILT IN GUANGDONG PROVINCE
46cc0316 HIS WEAPON THE PERSONAL BLESSING OF COMMUNIST PARTY GENERAL SECRETARY ZHAO ZIYANG
46cc0317 <NOISE> AT THE APRIL OPENING OF A FIVE HUNDRED AND TWELVE POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR GUANGDONG POWER PLANT OFFICIALDOM HEAPED PRAISE ON MR. WU FOR BEATING A CONSTRUCTION DEADLINE
46cc0318 INDONESIA AND THE PHILIPPINES ARE SO IMPRESSED THAT THEY HAVE ASKED HIM TO BUILD SIMILAR PLANTS
46cc0319 MANY ADMIRERS BELIEVE FIRMLY THAT IF ANYONE CAN GET BUSINESS DONE IN CHINA MR. WU CAN
46cc031a TO BEGIN WITH COMPANIES HAVE BEEN DOING A GOOD JOB OF MANAGING INVENTORIES
46cc031b IN THE PAST BUSINESSES HAVE TENDED TO BECOME INCREASINGLY OPTIMISTIC AS EXPANSIONS PERSISTED
46cc031c WHEN SALES EVENTUALLY SLOWED INVENTORIES QUICKLY REACHED EXCESSIVE LEVELS
46cc031d COMPANIES THEREUPON CUT THEIR BUYING INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION DECLINED AND A RECESSION WAS UNDER WAY
46cc031e ONE OF THE AFFINITY CARDS THAT CHEMICAL BANK DROPPED WAS MARKETED TO ALUMNI OF NEW YORK UNIVERSITY
46cc031f WE WERE SATISFIED WITH THE PROGRAM WHILE IT WAS RUNNING SAYS ROBERT CUNNINGHAM DIRECTOR OF ALUMNI RELATIONS AT N. Y. U.
46cc031g BUT IT ENDED AT CHEMICAL'S SUGGESTION
46cc0401 OCCIDENTAL OFFICALS SAY THE MINE WILL START COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS NEXT SEPTEMBER MORE THAN TWO YEARS BEHIND SCHEDULE
46cc0402 THE MINE IS EXPECTED TO PRODUCE BETWEEN THIRTEEN MILLION AND THIRTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION TONS OF STEAMING COAL ANNUALLY USED AT ELECTRIC GENERATING PLANTS SAYS MR. OGDEN
46cc0403 ALL BUT TEN PERCENT OF THE OUTPUT IS FOR EXPORT MOSTLY TO JAPAN SOUTH KOREA AND HONG KONG
46cc0404 SO FAR ILLEGAL FOREIGN WORKERS AREN'T TAKEN AS A JOB THREAT BY JAPANESE WORKERS
46cc0405 <NOISE> BUT JAPANESE UNEMPLOYMENT IS AT HISTORICALLY HIGH LEVELS BECAUSE OF THE YEN'S STRENGTH POSING A KNOTTY PROBLEM FOR THE GOVERNMENT
46cc0406 MANY JAPANESE COMPANIES IN SUCH INDUSTRIES AS STEEL AND SHIPBUILDING ARE CUTTING THEIR LABOR FORCES
46cc0407 BROKERAGE STOCKS HAVE BEEN WILTING FOR MONTHS BUT MR. CHANOS THINKS THEY COULD GET HIT LATER THIS YEAR IF OTHER FIRMS REPORT DOWN QUARTERS
46cc0408 SALOMON'S STOCK DIVED ELEVEN PERCENT ON HUGE VOLUME MONDAY CASTING A TEMPORARY PALL OVER THE WHOLE GROUP
46cc0409 IT CLOSED YESTERDAY AT THIRTY NINE AND SEVEN EIGHTHS UP ONE EIGHTH
46cc040a THE BRODERICK MEN ARE ATTRACTED TO LEAH BECAUSE SHE IS AN HONEST WOMAN IN A WORLD OF PRETENSE AND ARTIFICE
46cc040b <NOISE> SHE CAN MANIPULATE IDEOLOGY AND IMAGE TO FURTHER RADICAL CAUSES BUT SHE DOESN'T CONFUSE HER POLITICAL STRATAGEMS WITH REALITY
46cc040c INDEED SHE HAS NO PERSONAL DEVOTION TO THOSE CAUSES THEY ARE SIMPLY VEHICLES FOR HER PROFESSIONAL SKILLS
46cc040d THIS FASCINATES AND BAFFLES THE MEN AROUND HER
46cc040e <NOISE> ANOTHER REASON MR. SOIFER IS AVOIDING MORGAN AND CITICORP IS THAT THEIR STOCK PRICES AT TIMES HAVE TENDED TO GYRATE MORE VIOLENTLY THAN OTHER BANK ISSUES
46cc040f <NOISE> CITICORP AND MORGAN TEND TO HAVE MORE VOLATILITY ON DAYS WHEN PROGRAM TRADING IS KNOWN TO OCCUR MR. SOIFER SAYS
46cc040g THEY'RE MORE OF A BET ON WHICH WAY THE MARKET IS HEADED
46cc040h ALTHOUGH OPEC HAS TOYED WITH VOLUNTARY QUOTAS FOR SEVERAL YEARS IT DIDN'T REALLY BECOME SERIOUS ABOUT PRODUCTION CURBS UNTIL AFTER LAST YEAR'S COLLAPSE IN OIL PRICES
46cc040i MEMBER COUNTRIES CONTINUE TO ARGUE HOWEVER OVER THE FAIRNESS OF THEIR NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN QUOTAS AND EACH HAS REASON TO REPORT LESS THAN IT IS PRODUCING
46cc040j THE PROBLEM SAYS A SENIOR OPEC OFFICIAL IS THAT RIGID QUOTAS ARE INCOMPATIBLE WITH A FLEXIBLE OIL MARKET
46cc040k <NOISE> WITH ONE EAR LAURA SLOATE LISTENS TO A MAN READING HEADLINES FROM SIX NEWSPAPERS
46cc040l WITH THE OTHER EAR SHE MONITORS AN AIDE READING HER MAIL
46cc040m MEANWHILE SHE IS KEEPING UP A CONVERSATION SORT OF
46cc040n CORRESPONDENT BANKING OR PROVIDING SERVICES TO SMALLER BANKS IS ONE AREA THAT MANUFACTURERS MIGHT LEAVE
46cc040o THE PROFITABILITY OF THAT BUSINESS HAS BEEN DECLINING FOR YEARS MR. WOODEN SAID
46cc040p IT WAS THROUGH THESE CORRESPONDENT BANKS THAT MANUFACTURERS GOT ALL OF THESE ENERGY LOANS THAT HAVE SOURED
46cc040q <NOISE> HOWEVER ONE MANUFACTURERS EXECUTIVE SAID HE DOUBTED CORRESPONDENT BANKING WOULD BE ELIMINATED IN LIGHT OF THAT BUSINESS'S IMPROVED PERFORMANCE RECENTLY
46cc040r THE POINT A POINT MR. CAMPBELL KEEPS RETURNING TO IS THAT EVERY RELIGION IS TRUE
46cc040s IT'S TRUE AS A METAPHOR FOR THE HUMAN AND COSMIC MYSTERIES
46cc040t IT'S ONLY WHEN YOU'RE STUCK ON THE METAPHOR THAT YOU GET IN TROUBLE
46cc040u MR. SMITH SAID TRADING IN BRITISH AEROSPACE SHARES WOULD RESUME EARLY TODAY ON LONDON'S STOCK EXCHANGE
46cc040v TRADING WAS SUSPENDED AT FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY PENCE OR SEVEN DOLLARS AND NINETY FIVE CENTS WEDNESDAY
46cc040w <NOISE> <NOISE> ANALYSTS PREDICTED EARLY YESTERDAY THAT THE SHARES WOULD FALL WHEN TRADING RESUMED WHATEVER THE OUTCOME OF NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE E. C. AND BRITISH GOVERNMENT
46cc040x PROCESSORS BLAME THEIR SUPPLIERS
46cc040y CARGILL INCORPORATED A MAJOR CORN SYRUP MAKER SAYS IT IS PAYING COOPERATIVES FARMERS AND ELEVATORS MORE FOR THEIR CORN
46cc040z A SPOKESMAN SAYS SELLERS KNOW THEY CAN GO TO OTHER BUYERS
46cc0410 WE DON'T HAVE ANY GROWERS IN OUR POCKET
46cc0411 CARGILL CAN'T SET PRICES
46cc0412 AS FOR THE PRICES CARGILL CHARGES HE ADDS WE'RE TRYING TO GET THE MAXIMUM PRICE FOR OUR PRODUCTS ALL THE TIME
46cc0413 VIEWERS AND CRITICS SAY THE HUGE LOAD OF ADS AND AIRTIME IS PART OF THE PROBLEM
46cc0414 COMMERCIAL CLUTTER SEEMS GREATER THAN IN PREVIOUS OLYMPICS BROADCASTS MANY CRITICS SAY
46cc0415 THE COVERAGE BETWEEN ADS SOME COMPLAIN IS FRAGMENTED AND SHIFTY JUMPING TOO QUICKLY AMONG MYRIAD SPORTS
46cc0416 <NOISE> ACTUAL EVENTS AS OPPOSED TO TAPED PROFILES PREVIEWS AND REPORTS TAKE UP LESS THAN HALF OF THE AIRTIME
46cc0417 MANY HEADLINE EVENTS DON'T APPEAR UNTIL AFTER MIDNIGHT
46cc0418 IN PHILIPS SUN HAS WON A EUROPEAN ALLY THAT IT HOPES WILL PROVIDE AN EDGE OVER COMPETITORS
46cc0419 <NOISE> MOTOROLA I- INCORPORATED MIPS COMPUTER SYSTEMS INCORPORATED AND HEWLETT PACKARD COMPANY ARE JOCKEYING TO WOO COMPUTER MAKERS TO THEIR OWN RISC CHIPS
46cc041a THE CHIPS ARE RAPIDLY GAINING POPULARITY AMONG COMPUTER MAKERS AND THE ONE THAT GETS THE MOST CONVERTS COULD BECOME A DE FACTO STANDARD IN TOMORROW'S COMPUTER INDUSTRY
46cc041b <NOISE> THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE ON A SEVEN TO SEVEN VOTE LAST MONTH EFFECTIVELY KILLED MR. LUCAS'S NOMINATION TO HEAD THE DEPARTMENT'S CIVIL RIGHTS DIVISION
46cc041c A MAJORITY WAS NEEDED TO SEND THE NOMINATION TO THE FULL SENATE
46cc041d DEMOCRATIC MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CRITICIZED PRESIDENT BUSH AND MR. THORNBURGH FOR NOMINATING MR. LUCAS WHO HAS LITTLE EXPERIENCE AS A LAWYER AND NONE AS A CIVIL RIGHTS LITIGATOR
46dc0201 THE LACK OF MARKET DEPTH YESTERDAY ENABLED SEVERAL LARGE BUY ORDERS TO SPARK THE DOLLAR RALLY
46dc0202 ONE NEW YORK TRADER SAID HE WITNESSED THE CURRENCY'S VALUE JUMP AS HIS BANK EXECUTED A PURCHASE ORDER FOR TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN SEVERAL CHUNKS
46dc0203 WHEN THERE ARE VERY FEW PLAYERS THAT KIND OF ORDER WILL MOVE THE MARKET SAID THE TRADER WHO ASKED NOT TO BE IDENTIFIED
46dc0204 I WAS STARTLED STARTLED ISN'T THE WORD REACTED ALVIN NOVICK A BIOLOGY PROFESSOR AT YALE UNIVERSITY
46dc0205 HE WARNED THAT FORCED TESTING SUCH AS CONTEMPLATED BY THE CENTERS WOULD DRIVE HOMOSEXUALS UNDERGROUND AND AWAY FROM COOPERATION WITH PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAMS
46dc0206 RATIONAL PEOPLE WON'T COOPERATE IN RUINING THEIR OWN LIVES HE SAID
46dc0207 HE ALSO IS FOCUSING ON EL HERALD
46dc0208 WITH ONLY TWO NEWS REPORTERS AND A DESK OF TRANSLATORS IT LACKS VITALITY READERS SAY
46dc0209 MR. CASTILLO WANTS TO EXPAND THE SECTION AND SELL IT AS AN INDEPENDENT PAPER
46dc020a HE WILL BEGIN TESTING STAND ALONE SALES THIS MONTH
46dc020b HE HAD A POINT
46dc020c VITALY YURCHENKO OF THE K. G. B. THE MAN WHO HAD TOLD THE F. B. I. OF A SPY CODE NAMED MR.
46dc020d LONG HAD BY THIS TIME DEFECTED BACK TO THE SOVIET UNION AND WAS IN MOSCOW
46dc020e AND MR. PELTON HADN'T STOLEN ANY NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY DOCUMENTS TO GIVE THE SOVIETS
46dc020f OTHER ENTRANTS OFFER SUCH PEN NAMES AS GRANNY MR. DISCUSSION ANNA DARLING DEAR JOHN AND BEA READY
46dc020g I SUGGEST A HIP MACHO NAME WITH QUICK READER IDENTIFICATION STAN LANDERS
46dc020h I CAN PICTURE MY READERS IN A BAR AFTER WORK HEY DID YOU READ STAN THE MAN LANDERS THIS MORNING
46dc020i THAT GUY GIVES GREAT ADVICE
46dc020j RICHARD STEIN EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT FINANCE AT WORLDS OF WONDER SAID THE STOCK PROBABLY WAS MOVING DOWN IN SYMPATHY WITH OTHER TOY COMPANIES
46dc020k HOWEVER HE SAID WE ARE ONE OF THE FEW TOY COMPANIES THAT EXPECT AN UP FOURTH QUARTER
46dc020l HE SAID THE COMPANY IS EXCEEDING EXPECTATIONS IN SALES OF TEDDY RUXPIN ITS TALKING TEDDY BEAR AND OF LASER TAG AN INFRARED GUN GAME
46dc020m SOUNDS GOOD BUT WHAT'S THE CATCH
46dc020n MR. LEMING A CHEMICALS ANALYST ISSUED HIS REPORT JUNE TWENTY SECOND WITH SEAGRAM TRADING AT SEVENTY SEVEN
46dc020o IT CLOSED YESTERDAY AT SEVENTY SIX AND THREE EIGHTHS UP ONE AND SEVEN EIGHTHS
46dc020p THIS REASONING HAS CLEARLY FAILED TO GALVANIZE THE MARKET
46dc020q MR. LEMING DIDN'T RETURN CALLS SEEKING COMMENT YESTERDAY
46dc020r ANALYSTS ALSO SAID THEY HADN'T EXPECTED LOWER OPERATING PROFITS FOR THE COMPANY'S INDUSTRIES GROUP AND FOR THE BROADCASTING SEGMENT
46dc020s WESTINGHOUSE OFFICIALS TOLD ANALYSTS THAT OPERATING PROFIT IN THE INDUSTRIES GROUP FELL FIFTEEN PERCENT TO TWENTY PERCENT HURT IN PART BY WEAK RESULTS IN CANADIAN OPERATIONS
46dc020t A SHARP DROP IN OPERATING PROFIT FROM THE BROADCASTING GROUP'S PRODUCTION COMPANY CONTRIBUTED TO THE SLIGHTLY LOWER OPERATING EARNINGS OVERALL FOR THAT SEGMENT
46dc020u PIZZA HUT FOR EXAMPLE IS DEVELOPING AN ECONOMY PIE AND HAS INTRODUCED SEVERAL GOURMET PIZZA
46dc020v GODFATHER'S HAS INTRODUCED A LESS EXPENSIVE THIN CRUSTED PIE USED IN ITS TWO FOR ONE SPECIALS
46dc020w IT DEVELOPED THE ECONOMY LINE BECAUSE WE DIDN'T WANT TO CANNIBALIZE OUR PREMIUM PRODUCT SALES MR. HENDERSON SAYS
46dc020x MR. FORBES SAID HE'D HAD NO COMMUNICATION WITH ANYONE FROM THE I. R. S. TRYING TO DISSUADE HIM FROM PUBLISHING SUCH A STORY
46dc020y I ASSURE YOU THAT FORBES DOESN'T KILL STORIES AT THE REQUEST OF THE I. R. S. OR ANYONE ELSE HE SAID
46dc020z INDEED HE ADDED SUCH A CALL WOULD ALMOST ENSURE THE APPEARANCE OF SUCH A STORY
46dc0210 MR. FORBES SAID HE WOULD BE HARD PUT TO THINK OF THE COMMISSIONER'S NAME
46dc0211 HOWEVER THE LONG SIEGE OF CORPORATE COST CUTTING HAS ALREADY SLASHED CORPORATE PAYROLLS SO SEVERELY THAT MANY COMPANIES HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THEIR BREAK EVEN LEVELS OF OPERATIONS
46dc0212 IN EFFECT THEY ALREADY ARE OPERATING AS IF IN A RECESSION SO LAYOFFS MIGHT PROVE RELATIVELY MODEST
46dc0213 <NOISE> IN ADDITION THE ROLE OF MANUFACTURING IN THE ECONOMY HAS FADED IN COMPARISON WITH THE GROWTH OF RECESSION RESISTANT SERVICE JOBS
46dc0214 IN MOST MODERN NATIONS IT'S NOT CONSIDERED A THREAT TO NATIONAL SECURITY WHEN CRITICS OF THE GOVERNMENT DECIDE TO RUN FOR POLITICAL OFFICE
46dc0215 <NOISE> NOR IS IT SUBVERSIVE TO EMBARRASS THE PRIME MINISTER AND HIS ADMINISTRATION
46dc0216 SAD TO SAY IN SINGAPORE THIS SEEMS REASON ENOUGH TO INVOKE THE INTERNAL SECURITY ACT
46dc0217 <NOISE> WITH EVERY NEW BOUT OF GOVERNMENT PANIC IT BECOMES CLEARER THAT THE REAL FOREIGN ELEMENTS MR. LEE FEARS ARE HIS CRITICS IN SINGAPORE
46dc0218 MANY LAWMAKERS BELIEVE IT IS THEIR DUTY TO BRING HOME THE BACON AND THEY HAVE TROUBLE UNDERSTANDING WHY ANYONE WOULD THINK OTHERWISE
46dc0219 PORK BARRELING HAS GOTTEN A BAD NAME SAYS REPRESENTATIVE DOUGLAS BOSCO A CALIFORNIA DEMOCRAT
46dc021a THAT'S WHAT I'M HERE FOR
46dc021b IT TURNS OUT TO BE ONE OF THE FEW TANGIBLE THINGS WE CAN DO IN CONGRESS
46dc021c A POSSIBLE BACKLASH BY ENGLISH SPEAKING CANADIANS COULD BE THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE
46dc021d THERE'S NO WAY I CAN SELL THAT KEYBOARD TO CUSTOMERS IN VANCOUVER SAYS THE REPRESENTATIVE OF A U. S. COMPUTER MAKER
46dc021e THEY WILL CONTINUE TO USE THE STANDARD AMERICAN KEYBOARD
46dc021f SHE EXPECTS THE KEYBOARD TO GAIN ACCEPTANCE ONLY WITH THE FEDERAL AND QUEBEC GOVERNMENTS
46dc0301 THE BIGGEST DANGER ECONOMISTS SAY IS A FREE FALL OF THE DOLLAR
46dc0302 THAT WOULD FORCE THE U. S. TO RAISE INTEREST RATES TO ATTRACT THE FOREIGN CAPITAL NEEDED TO FINANCE ITS CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT AND INDIRECTLY ITS BUDGET DEFICIT
46dc0303 HIGHER RATES IN TURN COULD PLUNGE THE U. S. AND POSSIBLY THE WORLD INTO A RECESSION THAT COULD THREATEN THE INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL SYSTEM
46dc0304 FUJITSU'S BID FOR CONTROL OF FAIRCHILD SEMICONDUCTOR HAS LEFT THE PENTAGON DIVIDED
46dc0305 SOME FEAR A TAKEOVER OF THE MILITARY SUBCONTRACTOR COULD HURT NATIONAL SECURITY
46dc0306 BUT OTHERS SAY IT MIGHT ENCOURAGE JAPAN TO TRANSFER MILITARY TECHNOLOGY TO THE U. S.
46dc0307 THE NEW GOVERNMENT HAS STARTED TO LOWER PERSONAL INCOME TAXES AND AT THE SAME TIME IT HAS BEGUN TO BRING ITS OWN SPENDING UNDER CONTROL
46dc0308 IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN BUDGET THE HIGHEST RATE OF INCOME TAX WAS LOWERED TO FIFTY EIGHT PERCENT FROM SIXTY FIVE PERCENT
46dc0309 THIS IS PART OF A WORLD WIDE MOVEMENT THAT FRANCE MUST FOLLOW TO KEEP ITS MOST ENERGETIC AGGRESSIVE AND BRIGHT YOUNG PEOPLE AND TO ATTRACT INVESTORS
46dc030a FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD SPOKESMAN JOSEPH COYNE SAID YESTERDAY'S ACTION WAS DONE ENTIRELY AT CITICORP'S INITIATIVE
46dc030b ALTHOUGH FED OFFICIALS WERE ADVISED OF THE BANK'S PLANS IT WAS THEIR OWN JUDGMENT OF WHAT KIND OF RESERVE POSITIONS THEY SHOULD MAKE MR. COYNE SAID
46dc030c WE DON'T CONSIDER THIS A PRECEDENT FOR OTHER BANKS
46dc030d J. WALTER THOMPSON WILL RETAIN FORD'S U. S. CAR AND TRUCK ACCOUNTS FOR WHICH IT CREATED THE UBIQUITOUS HAVE YOU DRIVEN A FO:RD LATELY CAMPAIGN
46dc030e IT ALSO WILL RETAIN SMALLER FORD ACCOUNTS IN SIX OTHER COUNTRIES AND IT CONTINUES TO BE FORD'S LARGEST AGENCY
46dc030f BUT INDUSTRY SOURCES SAID THEY BELIEVED FORD WAS CONSIDERING GIVING ONE OF THOSE SIX ACCOUNTS FOR FORD'S LATIN AMERICAN AFFILIATE TO ANOTHER AGENCY
46dc030g BUT JOHN SMALE P. AND G'S CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE USED THE MEETING TO SPEAK AT LENGTH ABOUT HOSTILE TAKEOVERS IN GENERAL
46dc030h HE MAINTAINED THAT TOO OFTEN THEY LEAVE COMPANIES LOADED WITH DEBT AND SHRUNKEN RESEARCH BUDGETS AND IGNORE THE INTERESTS OF EMPLOYEES AND THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH THE COMPANIES DO BUSINESS
46dc030i HE ALSO ARGUED THAT OVER THE LONG RUN HOSTILE TAKEOVERS DON'T NECESSARILY PROVIDE A GOOD MECHANISM FOR SHAREHOLDERS TO REALIZE FULL VALUE FOR THEIR SHARES
46dc030j KHRUSHCHEV SAW PARTY ACTIVISM AS A KEY TO BRINGING HIS AMBITIONS TO FRUITION PARTICULARLY IN THE RURAL SECTOR
46dc030k RATHER THAN OFFER WORKERS INCREASED MATERIAL INCENTIVES HE MOBILIZED LOCAL PARTY OFFICIALS TO COAX FARMERS AND WORKERS TO PRODUCE MORE
46dc030l FARMS WERE PRESSURED TO TURN A PROFIT WITHIN THE EXISTING INADEQUATE PRICE STRUCTURE THROUGH GREATER OUTPUT

46dc030s A FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT AND AN APPEALS COURT BOTH IN RICHMOND UPHELD THE PLAN
46dc030t BUT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX THE SUPREME COURT TOLD THE APPEALS COURT TO RECONSIDER ITS DECISION IN LIGHT OF ANOTHER HIGH COURT RULING
46dc030u LAST JULY THE APPEALS COURT STRUCK DOWN THE PLAN RULING THAT AFFIRMATIVE ACTION MUST BE BASED ON EVIDENCE THAT THE CITY ITSELF HAD DISCRIMINATED IN THE PAST
46dc030v <NOISE> PAST SOCIETAL BIAS ISN'T SUFFICIENT BASIS TO JUSTIFY THE PLAN THE APPEALS COURT SAID IN AN OPINION WRITTEN BY JUDGE J. HARVIE WILKINSON THE THIRD
46dc030w IT IS SAD BUT TRUE THAT INTERNATIONAL SPORTING EXTRAVAGANZAS HAVE COME TO BE CONDUCTED AMID THE SORT OF SECURITY OTHERWISE RESERVED FOR THE TRAVELS OF HEADS OF STATE
46dc030x THE SWISS HOCKEY COACH WAS QUOTED AS SAYING THAT HIS PLAYERS WERE SURPRISED THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO SHOW THEIR PASSES AT THE BLUE LINE WHEN THEY BACK CHECKED

46dc0310 AS INFLATION SOARED AND THE FRANC NOSE DIVED HIS APPROVAL RATING PLUNGED
46dc0311 THEN HE CHANGED COURSE COMPLETELY
46dc0312 HIS NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE AUSTERITY PROGRAM WAS APPLAUDED BY EVEN HIS RIGHT WING OPPONENTS
46dc0313 AFTER NAMING FOUR COMMUNISTS TO HIS ORIGINAL CABINET HE BROKE WITH THE COMMUNISTS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR AND DESTROYED THEM AS A POLITICAL FORCE
46dc0314 <NOISE> OTHER LARGE AND MIDSIZED CARS POSTING GOOD SCORES WERE THE MERCURY SABLE THE OLDSMOBILE DELTA EIGHTY EIGHT AND THE BUICK REGAL

46dc0318 MR. ICAHN WANTS TO GIVE HOLDERS A MIXTURE OF TWENTY DOLLARS A SHARE IN CASH AND ABOUT THIRTY DOLLARS A SHARE FACE AMOUNT OF DEBENTURES
46dc0319 ON SOME LEDGERS THAT MIGHT SEEM TO ADD TO UP TO FIFTY DOLLARS
46dc031a BUT SOME INSIDERS APPARENTLY PREFER THIRTY SIX DOLLARS TO THIRTY EIGHT DOLLARS IN CASH
46dc031b FOUR T. W. A. VICE PRESIDENTS THREE CURRENT ONE DEPARTED RECENTLY SOLD ALL THEIR SHARES AT THOSE PRICES
46dc031c <NOISE> THE TREASURY ATTRIBUTED THE DECLINE TO UNUSUALLY S:TRONG SALES OF BONDS IN OCTOBER NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX THE FIRST MONTH OF FISCAL NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN

46dc0404 ADDS ROB MAGUIRE OF MAGUIRE THOMAS PARTNERS A LOS ANGELES BASED OFFICE DEVELOPER IT'S A TERRIFIC LOCATION
46dc0405 THE DEPARTMENT ALSO SAID THAT PRODUCTIVITY FOR NONFINANCIAL COMPANIES INCREASED AT A ZERO POINT THREE PERCENT ANNUAL RATE IN THE THIRD QUARTER A PRELIMINARY ESTIMATE
46dc0406 <NOISE> THE ESTIMATE IS BASED ON AN INCREASE IN OUTPUT OF ONE POINT FOUR PERCENT AND AN INCREASE IN HOURS WORKED OF ONE POINT ONE PERCENT
46dc0407 THIS WAS THE FIRST QUARTER IN WHICH PRODUCTIVITY INCREASED IN THE NONFINANCIAL SECTOR SINCE THE THIRD QUARTER OF NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE
46dc0408 BUT NEITHER EUROPEANS NOR AMERICANS SEEM ESPECIALLY EAGER
46dc0409 SOME EVEN CONTEND THAT CONVENTIONAL DEFENSES ARE ADEQUATE OR ARE GROWING IRRELEVANT
46dc040a NOT SO INSISTS MR. ABSHIRE WHO BELIEVES ENHANCING NATO'S CAPABILITIES IS OF ACCELERATING IMPORTANCE
46dc040b AS HAS BEEN THE CASE IN RECENT QUARTERS THE COMPANY'S ACTUAL RESULTS WERE MASKED BY SEVERAL SPECIAL CHARGES
46dc040c BEFORE A SIX MILLION DOLLAR LOSS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS PHILLIPS HAD PROFIT FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF SEVENTEEN MILLION DOLLARS OR FIVE CENTS A SHARE
46dc040d THAT PROFIT INCLUDED A TWELVE MILLION DOLLAR GAIN FROM ASSET SALES AND AN EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR CHARGE FROM STAFF REDUCTIONS
46dc040e MUCH OF THE LITIGATION INVOLVING BUSINESS BROKERS CENTERS ON THE LARGER BETTER STAFFED CONCERNS CONCERNS LIKE BUSINESS BUYERS
46dc040f <NOISE> THAT COMPANY WHICH EXCLUSIVELY REPRESENTS BUYERS SAYS IT HAS SIGNED MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY CLIENTS SINCE IT OPENED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO
46dc040g MOST ARE CORPORATE EXECUTIVES IN THEIR LATE FORTIES WHO PAID THE FIRM UP TO A TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR RETAINER D- FEE
46dc040h U. S. LAWMAKERS WHO ARE SYMPATHETIC TO ISRAEL ARE EXPECTED TO REACT TO THE REPORT BY PUBLICLY PRAISING ISRAEL FOR ITS RECENT STEPS
46dc040i HOWEVER THESE LEGISLATORS ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE DETAILS THAT MIGHT BE INCLUDED IN THE REPORT
46dc040j ALSO SINCE MILITARY CONTRACTS BETWEEN JERUSALEM AND PRETORIA ARE SECRET AND IT ISN'T KNOWN WHETHER THE PACTS CONTAIN RENEWAL CLAUSES IT WILL BE DIFFICULT TO MONITOR ISRAELI COMPLIANCE
46dc040k THE HYUNDAI THAT NIFTY AND CHEAP LITTLE KOREAN CAR HAS CAUGHT ON IN THE U. S. AND NO DOUBT COULD COMPETE IN ANY MARKET IN THE WORLD
46dc040l SO OUR WILLIAM MCGURN INQUIRED INTO HOW MANY HAVE BEEN EXPORTED FROM KOREA TO JAPAN

46dc040v I THINK IT'S A PERFECTLY HONORABLE PROFESSION
46dc040w IF MORE OF US DID IT THE OPPORTUNITIES WOULD GET SMALLER BECAUSE MORE FIRMS WOULD BE COMPETING TO CLOSE THE SAME SPREADS HE SAYS
46dc040x THE PRODUCT IS AN LEGITIMATE HEDGING PRODUCT AND A LEGITIMATE WAY TO ADD LIQUIDITY TO THE MARKET
46dc040y UNLIKE TRADITIONAL WHOLE LIFE POLICIES IN WHICH THE PREMIUM AND DEATH BENEFIT ARE FIXED UNIVERSAL LIFE GIVES HOLDERS CONSIDERABLE LATITUDE TO VARY THEIR PAYMENTS AND BENEFITS
46dc040z BUT IT HAS LIMITED GUARANTEES AND MUCH INVESTMENT RISK IS TRANSFERRED TO THE HOLDER
46dc0410 PREMIUM DOLLARS ARE INVESTED IN THE SAVING PORTION OF THE PLAN AND MONEY IS DEDUCTED PERIODICALLY TO PAY FOR ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND THE INSURANCE COVERAGE
46dc0411 PRICES AT THE MASS RETAIL LEVEL HOWEVER HAVEN'T RISEN MUCH IN A DECADE PARTLY BECAUSE BIG RETAILERS USE TENNIS BALLS TO LURE SHOPPERS
46dc0412 <NOISE> I REMEMBER PURCHASING A CAN OF BALLS FOR TWO DOLLARS IN NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN SAYS WALTER L. HENRY A PITTSBURGH RECREATIONAL PLAYER
46dc0413 TWO WEEKS AGO I PICKED UP A CAN FOR A DOLLAR EIGHTY NINE

46dc0417 WE'RE NOT INTERESTED IN SELLING AND WE'RE NOT SOLICITING ANYTHING HE SAID
46dc0418 HOWEVER HE ADDED THAT'S NOT TO SAY WE WOULDN'T ENTERTAIN ANY REASONABLE OFFER FOR AT LEAST A PIECE OF F. N. N.
46dc0419 PETER DAPUZZO HEAD OF RETAIL TRADING AT SHEARSON LEHMAN HUTTON ALSO LOOKS FOR A SHARP UPWARD MOVE IN STOCK PRICES GIVEN A FEW IFS

46dc041b ANOTHER IS IF THE FEDERAL RESERVE EASES INTEREST RATES
46dc041c AND A THIRD IS IF GEORGE BUSH WINS THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION
46dc041d FOOD BUYERS FOR ONE TEXAS SUPERMARKET CHAIN FURR'S INCORPORATED HAVE EVEN ASKED FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS JUST TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT ACCORDING TO ONE MANUFACTURER
46dc041e I JUST LAUGHED SAID THE SALES MANAGER OF A SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA CANDY COMPANY WHO REFUSED THE DEMAND
46dc041f FURR'S WOULDN'T CONFIRM OR DENY THE CLAIM
46ec0201 HOW IS WALL STREET REACTING TO THE CHANGES
46ec0202 SOME INVESTMENT BANKERS FEEL THREATENED BY IT OTHERS SCOFF AT SUGGESTION THAT THESE EFFORTS ARE TRULY COMPETITIVE
46ec0203 BUT SOME SAY THE CASE ISN'T CLEAR
46ec0204 FEW DEVELOPERS ARE BIG ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY THE COST OF THESE DIVISIONS
46ec0205 THE TEST WILL BE WHETHER THE NEW UNITS ARE ADDING VALUE TO THEIR ORGANIZATIONS
46ec0206 IF NOT ONE INVESTMENT BANKER SAYS THE PARTNERS WILL KILL THEM

46ec020p SOME WONDER WHETHER ALL THE CONVERSIONS DON'T MAKE MR. BEREGOVOY MORE OF AN OPPORTUNIST THAN A BELIEVER IN THE MARKET ECONOMY
46ec020q BUT HIS AIDES SAY HE WAS CONVINCED HE WAS DOING THE RIGHT THING
46ec020r MR. BEREGOVOY SAID I'M NOT ASHAMED OF WHAT I DO

46ec0216 OVERALL CONSUMER SPENDING HAS SLOWED SINCE LAST YEAR'S *STOCK* MARKET CRASH BUT IT'S STILL AT A LEVEL THAT WORRIES SOME ECONOMISTS
46ec0217 CONSUMER CREDIT SLOWED SHARPLY IN JULY REFLECTING SLUGGISH SALES
46ec0218 TOO MUCH SPENDING AT HOME COUPLED WITH HEAVY DEMAND FOR EXPORTS COULD OVERLOAD AN INDUSTRIAL SECTOR THAT IS ALREADY RUNNING NEAR CAPACITY
46ec0219 SOME BANKING ANALYSTS DOUBT A LONDON OR TOKYO BANK WOULD MAKE A SIMILAR ACQUISITION ANYTIME HERE SOON
46ec021a AMONG OTHER THINGS SOME FOREIGN BANKS HAVE BEEN SHYING AWAY FROM ACQUIRING ASSETS IN THE U. S. BECAUSE OF UNEXPECTEDLY HIGH EXPENSES MANAGING THEM FROM AFAR

46ec030r IN FACT THE PROFUSION AND VARIETY OF MR. HOCKNEY'S WORK <NOISE> SEEM TO HAVE GIVEN THE SHOW'S ORGANIZERS SOME PROBLEMS WITH ITS PRESENTATION
46ec030s FOR ALTHOUGH MR. HOCKNEY'S TALENT AND ORIGINALITY ARE GENERALLY ACKNOWLEDGED HE IS REGARDED IN SOME QUARTERS AS MORE OF A GIFTED ILLUSTRATOR THAN A MAJOR ARTIST
46ec030t AND SINCE IN RECENT YEARS HIS WORK HAS TENDED TO BE INCREASINGLY DECORATIVE A CHRONOLOGICAL ARRANGEMENT WAS APPARENTLY THOUGHT TO BE TOO RISKY
46ec030u THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION EXCORIATED DANIEL ORTEGA FOR HIS UNWILLINGNESS TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE CONTRAS
46ec030v IT CONTINUES TO QUIBBLE WITH PRETORIA FOR IGNORING THE AFRICAN NATIONAL CONGRESS
46ec030w BUT IN A REMARKABLE DEMONSTRATION OF INCONSISTENCY IT NOT ONLY APPLAUDS ISRAEL'S DEAFNESS TO THE P. L. O. IT STUFFS LEGISLATIVE PLUGS IN ITS OWN EARS AS WELL
46ec030x CERTAIN ELEMENTS OF A NATIONAL SYSTEM WERE OBVIOUS AND QUICKLY MADE THEIR WAY INTO USE
46ec030y THE FIRST WAS A COMPOSITE TAPE THAT BROUGHT INFORMATION FROM VARIOUS MARKET CENTERS ONTO ONE TICKER TAPE
46ec030z A COMPOSITE QUOTATION DISPLAY SYSTEM SOON FOLLOWED ALLOWING CUSTOMERS AND BROKERS TO SEE QUOTES FROM ALL MARKETS ON A SINGLE SCREEN
46ec0310 AND AN INTERNATIONAL MARKET TRADING SYSTEM ALLOWED ORDERS COMING TO VARIOUS EXCHANGE FLOORS TO FLOW FROM ONE EXCHANGE TO ANOTHER QUICKLY EASILY AND AT NO COST
46ec0311 MR. KAVNER SAID THE RIVAL GROUP LACKS A CLEAR PROCESS FOR RESOLVING DIFFERENCES
46ec0312 IN ADDITION HE SAID A. T. AND T. SPENDS FAR MORE EACH YEAR ON DEVELOPING UNIX THAN THE OPEN SOFTWARE FOUNDATION HAS INDICATED IT WILL SPEND

46ec0316 BUT THERE THE SIMILARITY ENDS
46ec0317 THE COSBY SHOW'S CLARE HUXTABLE IS A LOVING LAWYER AND A MATRIARCH IN A TWO HUNDRED DOLLAR SWEATER
46ec0318 ROSEANNE IS AN ACID TONGUED ASSEMBLY LINE WORKER IN AN OLD SWEATSHIRT

46ec0404 THE STATE SETS THE OFFICIAL RATE CURRENTLY TWO HUNDRED ZLOTYS TO THE DOLLAR
46ec0405 IT SETS THE PRICE OF VODKA NOW ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED ZLOTYS
46ec0406 THE STATE DOESN'T RUN THE BLACK MARKET OF COURSE
46ec0407 BUT ITS POLICE DON'T BREAK THE BIG RINGS EITHER
46ec0408 THEY SEEM CONTENT TO LET THE POLES TRADE THEIR LETTUCE
46ec0409 SOONER OR LATER PEWEX WILL GET MOST OF IT ANYWAY
46ec040a ALL INDICATIONS SUGGEST THOUGH THAT THE REAGAN NAKASONE SUMMIT WILL NOT BE ABOUT MONETARY POLICIES
46ec040b THEY WILL DISCUSS TRADE ISSUES WHICH ARE CERTAINLY IMPORTANT BUT RATHER REMOTE FROM THE IMMEDIATE PROBLEM
46ec040c ALL OF THE WORLD'S EXPORTS AND IMPORTS COME TO ABOUT TWO TRILLION A YEAR
46ec040d BUT FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET TRADING AMOUNTS TO ABOUT ONE TRILLION A WEEK
46ec040e IT IS IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS THAT THE BATTLE OF THE DOLLAR WILL HAVE TO BE FOUGHT
46ec040f THE F. C. C. REJECTED PETITIONS FROM SEVERAL PARTIES MAINTAINING THAT THE STATIONS SHOULD BE SOLD TO SOMEONE WITH CLOSER TIES TO THE HISPANIC COMMUNITY THAN HALLMARK
46ec040g HALLMARK HOWEVER HAS SAID IT WOULD CONTINUE THESE STATIONS IN THE SPANISH LANGUAGE FORMAT
46ec040h THE F. C. C. SAID THE CONCERNS OVER FUTURE PROGRAMMING WERE IRRELEVANT TO THE TRANSFER
46ec040i A PAINSTAKINGLY CRAFTED FEDERAL BLUEPRINT ENVISAGED STATES CLUSTERING INTO A DOZEN OR SO REGIONAL COMPACTS <NOISE> EACH WITH ITS OWN DISPOSAL SITE
46ec040j BUT STATES HAVE RUN INTO ENORMOUS POLITICAL ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC OBSTACLES IN TRYING TO PUT TOGETHER THESE AGREEMENTS

46ec040x THE U. S. SUGGESTED THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT AWARD THE PRIVATE TERMINAL CONTRACTS ONLY TO JAPANESE FIRMS THAT PROMISE TO USE FOREIGN SUBCONTRACTORS

46ec0411 FOR TEN DAYS IT BUYS TWO OUT OF EVERY THREE SANTA FE SHARES TRADED AND LIFTS ITS STAKE TO FOURTEEN PERCENT FROM FIVE PERCENT
46ec0412 SANTA FE DOESN'T MAKE A MOVE WHICH MR. DINGMAN TAKES AS A SIGN OF WEAKNESS

46ec041b THE OFFICIAL ALSO SAID OSHA DIDN'T ISSUE THE CITATION WITHIN THE SIX MONTHS SPECIFIED BY LAW FROM THE TIME AN OFFICIAL INSPECTION BEGINS
46fc0201 <NOISE> INDEED TO INVESTORS ALL SHARES OF THE SAME STOCK ARE ALIKE THE INVESTOR DOESN'T CARE WHICH ONE HE BUYS
46fc0202 BUT TWO EXAMPLES OF THE SAME STAMP ISSUE CAN DIFFER GREATLY IN VALUE DEPENDING ON THE QUALITY OF SAY PERFORATIONS INK OR GLUE

46fc020e AS THE U. S. BUILDINGS WERE COMPLETED IN MOSCOW THE SOVIETS WERE ALLOWED TO MOVE INTO SOME OF THEIR NEW FACILITIES ON MOUNT ALTO
46fc020f ONLY THE MAIN AMBASSADORIAL BUILDINGS AT EACH SITE ARE VACANT

46fc0305 BUT RETAILERS HAVE SEEN STRONG SALES OF BIG TICKET ITEMS TO WELL HEELED CUSTOMERS
46fc0306 THEY ARE BUYING TO BEAT THE NEW TAX LAW WHICH WILL END THE DEDUCTION OF SALES TAXES AND SOME INTEREST EXPENSES
46fc0307 BALLY'S DRIVE INTO THE HOTEL CASINO INDUSTRY HAS MADE HEALTH CLUBS AN INCREASINGLY AWKWARD FIT ANALYSTS SAID AND THUS THE MOST LIKELY CANDIDATE FOR DIVESTITURE
46fc0308 BY SHEDDING THE HEALTH CLUB LINE BALLY COULD FOCUS ON ITS REMAINING OPERATIONS GAMBLING MACHINES STATE LOTTERIES AND AMUSEMENT CENTERS
46fc0309 ANALYSTS ALSO QUESTION THE FIT OF THE COMPANY'S THEME PARKS THOUGH SAYING A SALE OF THAT OPERATION COULD FOLLOW
46fc030a THE NEW POLICY ISN'T CLEARLY DELINEATED
46fc030b IT STIPULATES THAT NO NEW DEFENSE CONTRACT WILL BE SIGNED

46fc030f THOUGH THE FILING COMPLICATES THE BATTLE MOST EXPERTS BELIEVE NEITHER COMPANY WILL EMERGE THE WINNER
46fc030g THE COURT WAS SPLIT ON BOTH THE WILLIAMS ACT AND COMMERCE CLAUSE
46fc030h JUSTICE LEWIS POWELL ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO CASE OF EDGAR V.
46fc030i MITE SUGGESTED THAT ANY STATE LAW THAT FAVORED TARGETS MORE THAN DID THE WILLIAMS ACT WOULD BE INVALID BECAUSE CONGRESS HAD PREEMPTED LOCAL REGULATIONS
46fc030j <NOISE> THE COURT BACKTRACKED HERE TO SAY STATE LAWS MIGHT BE O. K. IF THEY HELP THE WILLIAMS ACT'S PURPOSE BY HEAPING EVEN MORE BURDENS ON ACQUIRERS
46fc030k THE SYSTEM ISN'T A HUNDRED PERCENT PERFECT BUT IT'S WORKING REASONABLY WELL A FOREIGN MINISTRY OFFICIAL TOLD REPORTERS
46fc030l THE OFFICIAL SAID THE U. S. HAS BEEN SIMILARLY REASSURED
46fc030m EVEN SO THE U. S. HAS INDICATED THAT IT WANTS JAPAN TO TAKE BETTER CARE OF HOW JAPANESE TECHNOLOGY IS SOLD AROUND THE WORLD
46fc030n ANOTHER INCENTIVE THAT FOOD PROCESSORS CITE FOR GETTING INTO THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS IS THE HIGH COST OF INTRODUCING NEW GROCERY ITEMS
46fc030o STARTING A NEW BRAND CAN EASILY COST GENERAL MILLS MORE THAN TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN DEVELOPMENT AND PROMOTION COSTS
46fc030p OF COURSE THE OLIVE GARDEN START UP BRICK AND MORTAR AND ALL HAS COST FIVE TIMES THAT
46fc030q PRATT AND WHITNEY SAID LAST WEEK IT MIGHT LAY OFF EMPLOYEES AFTER THE FIRST YEAR OF THE BUSINESS BECAUSE OF DECREASED DEMAND FOR JET ENGINES AND PARTS
46fc030r THE COMPANY DECLINED TO DISCUSS HOW MANY EMPLOYEES MIGHT BE LAID OFF OR IF THE LOSS WOULD BE PERMANENT OR TEMPORARY
46fc030s BUT UNION OFFICIALS SAID THE COMPANY HAS TOSSED AROUND NUMBERS FROM SIXTEEN HUNDRED TO TWO THOUSAND
46fc030t AS A RESULT THE GOVERNMENT IS TALKING OF HIGHER FARM PRICES
46fc030u BUT HIGHER FARM PRICES WOULD ADD TO AN ALREADY STEEP INFLATION RATE
46fc030v SO BEIJING OFFICIALS REPORTEDLY TALK OF TYING WAGES TO INFLATION AN IDEA REMINISCENT OF THE WAGE INDEXATION TRIED IN SOME LATIN AMERICAN NATIONS SEVERAL YEARS AGO WITH DISASTROUS RESULT(S)-
46fc030w BUT U. S. MANUFACTURERS WHO TOOK A BEATING DURING THE FIRST HALF OF THIS DECADE CONTINUE TO ENJOY A ROARING REVIVAL THAT BEGAN LAST YEAR
46fc030x AS A RESULT THERE IS GROWING EVIDENCE THAT FACTORY WAGE AND PRICE INCREASES ARE ACCELERATING
46fc030y AND THAT COULD LEAD THE FED TO BOOST INTEREST RATES IN AN EFFORT TO COOL DOWN THE ECONOMY IN THE COMING MONTHS
46fc030z <NOISE> TO BE SURE A FEW COMPANIES ARE TRYING TO USE THE OLYMPICS TO MAKE THE TRANSITION FROM A SUBCONTRACTOR TO AN INTERNATIONALLY KNOWN BRAND
46fc0310 KUKJE CORPORATION SHIFTED FROM PRODUCING NIKE SHOES TO DEVELOPING ITS OWN PRO SPECS LINE OF ATHLETIC SHOES FIVE YEARS AGO
46fc0311 IT PAID FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN CASH AND GOODS TO BE AN OFFICIAL SPONSOR OF THE GAMES AND HAS BEEN HIGHLIGHTING THE LOGO IN ITS ADVERTISING
46fc0312 KUKJE HOPES THE OLYMPICS WILL HELP GIVE PRO SPECS A FOOTHOLD IN EUROPE
46fc0313 THE NEW EMPHASIS ON MAKING SCHOOLS WORK HAS PUSHED ASIDE SOME OTHER LONGSTANDING SCHOOL DEBATES
46fc0314 DESEGREGATION OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS REMAINS A GOAL BUT IS ENTIRELY ELUSIVE IN MANY AREAS-
46fc0315 MANY FAMILIES THAT COULD WHITE OR BLACK FLED TO SUBURBAN PRIVATE OR PAROCHIAL SCHOOLS AS BUSING ALONE BECAME A MORE DISCUSSED ISSUE THAN SCHOOL CURRICULA
46fc0316 WITH A FEW EXCEPTIONS SUCH AS YONKERS AND KANSAS CITY FEDERAL JUDGES HAVE LEARNED TO ESCHEW THEIR TRAGIC SOCIAL ENGINEERING
46fc0317 MOST NOW LEAVE SCHOOL SYSTEMS ALONE TO ATTRACT STUDENTS BACK NOT DRIVE THEM OUT
46fc0318 THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF RECESSION LIKE DEVELOPMENTS IN THESE STATISTICS SAID NORMAN ROBERTSON CHIEF ECONOMIST AT MELLON BANK CORPORATION
46fc0319 AS A RESULT HE SAID IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT THE FED IS GOING TO EASE AT THIS TIME
46fc031a UNDER THESE CONDITIONS THE FED WILL PROBABLY ADOPT A FAMILIAR WAIT AND SEE ATTITUDE
46fc031b SOME OF THAT CASH HAS BEEN USED FOR BONUS PAYMENTS
46fc031c WAGES AND BONUSES ROSE NINETEEN PERCENT IN THE FIRST HALF A RATE THAT FAR OUTPACED ECONOMIC GROWTH AND EXERTED UPWARD PRESSURE ON PRICES
46fc031d CHINA'S ECONOMY GREW AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF FIVE POINT SEVEN PERCENT IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS ROUGHLY HALF THE AVERAGE ANNUAL RATE IN THE PAST DECADE
46fc0401 THIS REPORT DOESN'T INCLUDE PRESIDENT REAGAN'S OWN VERSION OF EVENTS
46fc0402 DOES THE PRESIDENT HAVE A VERSION OF THE EVENTS

46fc0409 THE ONLY NOTICEABLE DECLINES WERE IN RESTAURANTS POINT SIX PERCENT AND FOOD STORES POINT THREE PERCENT
46fc040a EXCLUDING AUTOS SALES ROSE POINT FOUR PERCENT LAST MONTH
46fc040b IF WE LOOK AT THE RECORD THE DEBATE SHOULD BE RATHER SHORT
46fc040c THE WINNERS OBVIOUS
46fc040d THE ONLY TRAGEDY AND IT'S AN AMAZING ONE IS THAT MOST AMERICANS DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED AND HOW IT CAME ABOUT
46fc040e CHRISTIANS AND MOSLEMS MARCHED ACROSS BEIRUT'S SECTARIAN DEMARCATION LINE TO PROTEST LEBANON'S ECONOMIC CRISIS

46gc0415 MR. PAPAGEORGE SAID "QUOTE THESE WERE CONCEPTUAL NEGOTIATIONS
46gc0416 IDEAS WERE FLOWING
46gc0417 WE WERE SEEING WHAT WORKED FOR EACH OF US
46gc0418 THE TWO OF US WERE TRYING TO THINK OF A WAY TO SATISFY EVERYONE "UNQUOTE
46gc0419 <NOISE> BUT IT'S WHAT THIS ELECTION IS ALL ABOUT
46gc041a <NOISE> THE REAL QUESTION ON THE BALLOT IS SHOULD RE- SHOULD THE REAGAN YEARS CONTINUE BEYOND THE REAGAN YEARS
46gc041b BEYOND THE BUSH YEARS
46gc041c <NOISE> BEYOND EVEN THE QUAYLE YEARS
46gc041d THE SUPREME COURT WILL DETERMINE THAT AND THE NEXT PRESIDENT WILL DETERMINE THE COURT'S MAKEUP FOR AT LEAST ANOTHER GENERATION
46gc041e <NOISE> WARNER LAMBERT AND SCHERING PLOUGH ARE CONVE- COVETED FOR THEIR OVER THE COUNTER DRUGS AS WELL AS FOR PRESCRIPTION SALES
46gc041f <NOISE> OVER THE COUNTER DRUGS SUCH AS WARNER LAMBERT'S LISTERINE MOUTHWASH ARE THOUGHT TO HAVE FRANCHISE VALUE
46gc041g "QUOTE THEY AREN'T RESEARCH INTENSIVE THEY'RE MARKETING INTENSIVE "UNQUOTE ONE ANALYST SAID
46hc0201 THE SALE OF THE HOTELS IS PART OF HOLIDAY'S STRATEGY TO SELL OFF ASSETS AND CONCENTRATE ON PROPERTY MANAGEMENT
46hc0202 THE HOTEL OPERATOR'S EMBASSY SUITES HOTELS INC. SUBSIDIARY WILL CONTINUE TO MANAGE THE PROPERTIES
46hc0203 LONG TERM MANAGEMENT CONTRACTS ALLOW US TO GENERATE INCOME ON A SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER CAPITAL BASE SAID MICHAEL D. ROSE HOLIDAY'S CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
46hc0204 ALBERT HALPRIN CHIEF OF THE F. C. C.'S COMMON CARRIER BUREAU SAID HE HADN'T SEEN THE CONSUMER GROUP'S STUDY
46hc0205 HE SAID PREVIOUS STUDIES BY THE GROUP HAD FOCUSED ON FLAT RATE SERVICE FOR LOCAL CALLS
46hc0206 MR. HALPRIN CONCEDED THAT SUCH RATES HAD RISEN SHARPLY BUT HE ADDED THAT PHONE COMPANIES NOW OFFER A VARIETY OF LOCAL TELEPHONE PLANS AT DIFFERING PRICES
46hc0207 AROUND THAT TIME MR. GENGER ALSO MET WITH MR. EL SAYED
46hc0208 HE SURFACED TO MEET WITH GENGER AFTER GENGER HAD MADE THE APPROACH TO THE COMPANY SAID MR. TROTMAN THE DREXEL BURNHAM BANKER
46hc0209 I THINK HE WAS TRYING TO FIND A WAY BACK IN
46hc020a BUT MR. TROTMAN SAID MR. EL SAYED ISN'T INVOLVED IN THE TRANS RESOURCES BID
46hc020b INSTEAD MR. REAGAN AGREED TO LOWER THE VOLUME OF HIS COMMENTS SUPPORTING THE CONTRAS AND CRITICIZING THE DEMOCRATIC CONTROLLED CONGRESS
46hc020c HE ALSO WOULD HOLD OFF ON ANY NEW PROPOSALS FOR CONTRA MILITARY AID UNTIL SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH
46hc020d IF THE SANDINISTA GOVERNMENT HAD MADE SIGNIFICANT DEMOCRATIC REFORMS AND A CEASEFIRE WAS IN PLACE MR. REAGAN WOULD END HIS CONTRA MILITARY AID PROGRAM
46hc020e <NOISE> IN KOREA LABOR CONFLICTS HAVE ADDED HEAT TO THE UNSTABLE POLITICAL SITUATION
46hc020f THE NEW UNIONS ARE GROWING MORE ADVERSARIAL
46hc020g COMPANIES KEEP ASKING THE GOVERNMENT TO SMASH THE UNIONS
46hc020h BUT THE RULING PARTY CAN'T RISK ALIENATING WORKERS WHO WILL VOTE IN THE COMING ELECTIONS
46hc020i IT REFUSES SO FAR TO BACKTRACK ON ITS JULY FIRST PROMISE OF GREATER DEMOCRACY OR TO RETURN TO THE POLICY OF OVERT UNION BUSTING
46hc020j IN A NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT SEVENTY NINE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING THE S. E. C.'S ENFORCEMENT DIVISION PRESSED FOR MR. KOBRIN'S PERMANENT EXPULSION FROM THE SECURITIES BUSINESS
46hc020k THE DIVISION ARGUED THAT STOCK MANIPULATION OF THE KIND HE HAD BEEN ENGAGED IN WENT TO THE HEART OF THE SECURITIES LAWS
46hc020l THE DIVISION ALSO SAID THE LAW DIRECTED THE S. E. C. TO ACT ON THE BELIEF THAT PAST MISCONDUCT RAISED A RISK OF FUTURE MISCONDUCT THAT MIGHT JUSTIFY EXPULSION
46hc020m CERTAINLY FOREIGN COMPETITION AND A CHANGING WORLD ECONOMY HAVE EXACTED A HEAVY TOLL ON OUR NATION'S MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES
46hc020n HOWEVER MANY OF THESE INDUSTRIES HAVE SURVIVED AND ARE NOW AS TOUGH AND LEAN AS THEY'VE EVER BEEN
46hc020o THE MANAGERS OF THESE COMPANIES HAVE LEARNED THROUGH HARD EXPERIENCE ABOUT EXACTLY WHICH INVESTMENTS PAY OFF
46hc020p ALTHOUGH AIRLINES DENY HANDLING COMPLAINTS DIFFERENTLY THEY MAKE NO APOLOGIES ABOUT FAVORING FREQUENT FLIERS IN OTHER WAYS
46hc020q <NOISE> THEY SAY THEY ARE ONLY TRYING TO BOOST MEMBERSHIP IN THESE PROGRAMS WHICH AIRLINES CONSIDER CRUCIAL FOR DEVELOPING BRAND LOYALTY
46hc020r THESE ARE OUR MOST IMPORTANT CUSTOMERS SAYS A UNITED SPOKESMAN
46hc020s MR. ANTONIU'S FALL AND SURPRISING REBOUND PROVE THERE IS LIFE AFTER INSIDER TRADING
46hc020t BUT HIS STORY ALSO SUGGESTS THAT SOME CHARACTER TRAITS THAT MAY GIVE RISE TO INSIDER TRADING CAN BE HARD TO CHANGE
46hc020u INSIDER TRADING IS A FORM OF FRAUD AND SOME SPORT ABOUT FRANCHISEES NOW CLAIM THEY HAVE BEEN DEFRAUDED BY MR. ANTONIU
46hc020v STILL TRADERS WERE ENCOURAGED BY INVESTOR REACTION TO THIS WEEK'S TREASURY FINANCING ESPECIALLY YESTERDAY'S THIRTY YEAR BOND SALE
46hc020w WE THOUGHT THERE WAS VERY BROAD JAPANESE PARTICIPATION IN THE BOND AUCTION SAID MR. LAKEFIELD OF SHEARSON LEHMAN
46hc020x BUT THE REAL QUESTION IS WHETHER THE JAPANESE BOUGHT FOR SHORT TERM TRADING ACCOUNTS OR FOR LONG TERM INVESTMENT
46hc020y INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS LOOKING FOR SOME EXCITEMENT IN THEIR LIVES AREN'T LIKELY TO BE ENTHRALLED BY MR. BERG'S ADVICE
46hc020z HE SAYS THAT THEY DROP THEIR HARD EARNED DOLLARS INTO THE MOST CONSERVATIVE OF INVESTMENTS T. BILLS AND SIT TIGHT
46hc0210 THERE'S NO SENSE TRYING TO PLAY GAMES WITH THIS MARKET MR. BERG EXPLAINS
46hc0211 THINGS ARE A BIT DULLER THIS YEAR
46hc0212 <NOISE> <NOISE> MR. BILZERIAN HAS SENT HIS BOY TO A LITTLE LEAGUE TEAM IN FARAWAY MINNESOTA WHERE THE FAMILY SPENDS ITS SUMMERS AND ISN'T COACHING A TEAM THIS YEAR
46hc0213 ALL THE ACTION APPARENTLY WILL BE IN THE COURTROOM
46hc0214 THE GRAND METROPOLITAN OPERATIONS WHICH WERE ACQUIRED BY THAT COMPANY IN NINETEEN EIGHTY HAVE ENJOYED A GOOD REPUTATION IN THE INDUSTRY
46hc0215 <NOISE> BUT PEPSICO FEELS *ITS* TERRITORIES CAN BE BETTER EXPLOITED DUE TO THEIR PROXIMITY TO EXISITING COMPANY OWNED BOTTLERS
46hc0216 <NOISE> IT OWNS ITS LOS ANGELES AND SAN FRANCISCO BOTTLERS FOR INSTANCE MAKING THE CENTRAL CALIFORNIA TERRITORY A GOOD FIT
46hc0217 IT ALSO ALREADY OWNS ITS BOTTLERS IN CENTRAL AND NORTHERN FLORIDA AND PARTS OF GEORGIA
46hc0218 THERE ARE SOME GREAT OPPORTUNITIES TO MAXIMIZE PRODUCTION AND MARKETING EFFICIENCIES THE PEPSICO SPOKESMAN SAID
46hc0219 PETER DAPUZZO HEAD OF RETAILING TRADING AT SHEARSON LEHMAN HUTTON ALSO LOOKS FOR A SHARP UPWARD MOVE IN STOCK PRICES GIVEN A FEW IFS
46hc021a ONE IS IF INVESTORS DON'T GET SPOOKED AT THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE CRASH
46hc021b ANOTHER IS IF THE FEDERAL RESERVE EASES INTEREST RATES
46hc021c AND A THIRD IS IF GEORGE BUSH WINS THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION
46hc021d BUT SERVICE MERCHANDISE JUMPED ONE AND THREE EIGHTHS TO EIGHTEEN AND A QUARTER ON ONE POINT FOUR MILLION SHARES
46hc021e THE STOCK SLID TO TWELVE AND A QUARTER IN SEPTEMBER AFTER THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT AN INVESTOR GROUP HAD DECIDED NOT TO PROCEED WITH A POSSIBLE ACQUISITION OFFER
46hc021f SINCE THEN THE STOCK HAS BEEN RISING ON TAKEOVER RUMORS
46hc0301 MR. HU YAOBANG WAS DUMPED IN JANUARY AS THE COMMUNIST PARTY'S SECRETARY GENERAL MR. ZHAO WAS ELEVATED TO THAT POST ON AN ACTING BASIS
46hc0302 THAT MADE MR. ZHAO A PROTEGE OF DENG XIAOPING THE DE FACTO HEAD OF THE PARTY AS WELL AS THE GOVERNMENT
46hc0303 IT IS A DELICATE POSITION REQUIRING HIM TO MANEUVER AMONG VARIOUS INTEREST GROUPS AND PERSONAL CLIQUES THAT MAKE UP CHINA'S TOP LEADERSHIP
46hc0304 PAINEWEBBER ITSELF HASN'T BEEN CHARGED WITH WRONGDOING
46hc0305 THE FIRM A UNIT OF PAINEWEBBER GROUP INCORPORATED RELEASED A SHORT TERM STATEMENT YESTERDAY IN WHICH IT SAID THE TWO MEN HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED INDEFINITELY
46hc0306 THE FIRM HAS COOPERATED WITH THE U. S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE THROUGHOUT THE INVESTIGATION AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO
46hc0307 THEN THERE ARE UTILITY STOCKS
46hc0308 THE NASDAQ UTILITY INDEX JUMPED EIGHTEEN PERCENT IN THE FIRST QUARTER WHILE INDEXES OF LISTED UTILITY STOCKS ROSE BARELY THREE PERCENT
46hc0309 BUT IN FACT MOST OF THE FIFTY FIVE ELECTRIC GAS AND WATER UTILITY STOCKS ON NASDAQ PERFORMED MUCH LIKE THEIR COUNTERPARTS ON THE MAJOR EXCHANGES
46hc030a PRODUCERS HOWEVER SAY THE GUILD DEMAND REALLY REPRESENTS AN EFFORT TO SQUEEZE IN MORE THAN ONE SESSION A DAY
46hc030b THE ACTORS ARE PAID BY THE SESSION NOT BY THE HOUR AND BOTH SIDES AGREE THAT SESSIONS RARELY EXCEED THREE HOURS
46hc030c AND WITH THE GUILD CHOOSING SUCH A CRITICAL TIME FOR THE STRIKE T. V. PRODUCTION OFFICIALS ARE ESPECIALLY IRATE
46hc030d WHEN MY FAMILY FLED WE LEFT MY NANNY IN CHARGE OF THE HOUSE
46hc030e <NOISE> BUT SOON A LIEUTENANT IN THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMY EVICTED HER AND INSTALLED HIS MISTRESS
46hc030f LATER THE HOUSE WENT TO THE NORTH KOREANS
46hc030g F. D. A. RESEARCHERS SAY THEY DON'T KNOW MUCH YET ABOUT THE LONG TERM EFFECTS OF FAT SUBSTITUTES MIXING WITH MEDICATION AND OTHER SUBSTANCES
46hc030h TYPICALLY LAB TESTS ON FOOD PRODUCTS ARE FOR THE LIFE CYCLE OF RATS OR MICE ABOUT FOUR YEARS
46hc030i RESEARCHERS SAY THEY AREN'T SURE SUCH TESTS PARALLEL HUMAN CONSUMPTION OF FAT OVER LONGER PERIODS
46hc030j WE JUST DON'T KNOW SAYS THE F. D. A.'S MR. MERTZ
46hc030k WITH EVERY NEW DEVELOPMENT THERE ARE RISKS
46hc030l ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE TALKS SURPRISED ANALYSTS AND FAILED TO IMPRESS INVESTORS
46hc030m BRITISH AEROSPACE SHARES FELL TWENTY FIVE PENCE FORTY FOUR CENTS TO THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE PENCE IN LATE TRADING YESTERDAY ON LONDON'S STOCK EXCHANGE
46hc030n THE HANDFUL OF ROVER SHARES TRADING JUMPED NINETEEN PENCE TO EIGHTY SIX PENCE AFTER THE ANNOUNCEMENT BUT FELL BACK TO EIGHTY TWO PENCE
46hc030o MR. THAYER SAID MR. YOUNG RECEIVED A LUMP SUM PAYMENT TO SETTLE HIS CONTRACT WITH GIBRALTAR FINANCIAL BUT WOULDN'T DISCLOSE THE AMOUNT
46hc030p MR. YOUNG'S CONTRACT WHICH RAN UNTIL JANUARY TWENTY FOURTH NINETEEN NINETY ONE CALLED FOR A SALARY OF AT LEAST FOUR HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR
46hc030q IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX MR. YOUNG WAS PAID FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND NINETY SIX DOLLARS
46hc030r AS A RECENT VISIT REVEALED THE SOUP KITCHEN HAS BECOME A POWERFUL MAGNET DRAWING HUNDREDS WHO COME FOR MORE THAN JUST DAILY NOURISHMENT
46hc030s MR. KOVACS AN OCTOGENARIAN WHO CROONS LOVE BALLADS TO ANYONE WHO WILL LISTEN COMES FOR CAMARADERIE
46hc030t FOR GEORGE A MIDDLE AGED RETARDED MAN THE KITCHEN IS A LIFELINE
46hc030u HE ARRIVED FIVE YEARS AGO PICKED UP A BROOM AND WITHOUT SAYING A WORD STARTED CLEANING UP HE NOW GETS PAID THE MINIMUM WAGE
46hc030v THE OFFER IS A BRILLIANT DEFENSE CONTRIVED BY SANTA FE'S INVESTMENT BANKERS AT SALOMON BROTHERS AND GOLDMAN SACHS
46hc030w THE SIXTY THREE DOLLARS A SHARE PRICE WILL HANG OVER THE NEGOTIATIONS LIKE SMOG OVER LOS ANGELES
46hc030x AND THOUGH MR. DINGMAN WILL OFFER PACKAGE AFTER PACKAGE THAT SEEMS TO ADD UP TO SIXTY THREE DOLLARS HE DOESN'T REALLY PLAN TO MEET THE ASKING PRICE-
46hc030y INSTEAD HE HOPES TO PERSUADE SANTA FE TO TAKE LESS
46hc030z FOR ONE HUNDRED YEARS WYOMING HAS BEEN RIDING A ROLLER COASTER
46hc0310 WHEN COMMODITY PRICES RISE PEOPLE RUSH TO WYOMING FOR SHORT TERM WORK AT BOOM TOWN PA(Y)-
46hc0311 GOVERNMENT REVENUES LARGELY UNDERWRITTEN BY ENERGY COMPANY TAXES EXPLODE
46hc0312 WHEN COMMODITY PRICES SOUR PEOPLE PULL OUT OFTEN WITH THEIR MOBILE HOMES TRAILING BEHIND
46hc0313 AND REVENUES SLUMP
46hc0314 THE REASON FOR THE RELATIVELY MODEST INCENTIVE PROGRAMS IS THAT THE AUTO MAKERS ARE DEMONSTRATING A MUCH BETTER ABILITY TO KEEP PRODUCTION IN LINE WITH SALES
46hc0315 <NOISE> <NOISE> INVENTORIES OF U. S. MADE CARS STOOD AT FIFTY NINE DAYS SUPPLY AT THE END OF AUGUST ACCORDING TO WARD'S AUTOMOTIVE REPORTS AN INDUSTRY TRADE PUBLICATION
46hc0316 THAT IS CONSIDERED A NORMAL SUPPLY AND IT IS THE LOWEST STOCK IN TWENTY TWO MONTHS
46hc0317 TAKEOVER TALK AROUSED INTEREST IN TWO FINANCIAL CORNERS
46hc0318 MERCANTILE BANCORP SOARED FIVE AND A HALF TO THIRTY AND THREE QUARTERS ON RENEWED BUY OUT SPECULATION
46hc0319 SUN STATE SAVINGS AND LOAN ENDED AT EIGHT AND A QUARTER UP TWO AFTER CONFIRMING THAT IT RECEIVED AN UNSOLICITED ACQUISITION PROPOSAL FROM AN INVESTMENT GROUP
46hc031a IN HOUSTON A COASTAL SPOKESMAN SAID THE FIGHT ISN'T OVER
46hc031b WE ANTICIPATE ASKING FOR A REHEARING OR APPEALING TO THE SUPREME COURT THE SPOKESMAN SAID
46hc031c HE ADDED WE WERE QUITE SURPRISED BY THE REVERSAL
46hc031d WE THOUGHT WE HAD A SOLID CASE
46hc0401 I'VE BEEN TRYING TO LIVE MY LIFE BY AN IDEA SHE SAYS POINTING TO A VIDEO GAME
46hc0402 SEE THAT MACHINE
46hc0403 THAT'S AN IDEA
46hc0404 ROCK AND ROLL
46hc0405 THAT'S AN IDEA
46hc0406 IN HEAVY TRADING FRIDAY PROFIT TAKING CAUSED THE NIKKEI AVERAGE TO SLIP SEVENTY POINT ONE EIGHT TO TWENTY ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND FIVE POINT EIGHT FIVE
46hc0407 THE DECLINE SNAPPED A STRING OF FIVE RECORD CLOSINGS
46hc0408 THE STOCK EXCHANGE INDEX FELL TWELVE POINT NINE TWO POINTS TO EIGHTEEN SIXTEEN POINT SIX NINE
46hc0409 VOLUME TOTALED ABOUT ONE BILLION SHARES
46hc040a MR. ABBOUD ALSO GAINED A REPUTATION DURING THE FIRST CHICAGO YEARS AS BEING ABRASIVE AND SOMETIMES HARSH WITH SUBORDINATES AND THAT TAG HAS LINGERED
46hc040b I'VE NEVER SEEN AN ADJECTIVE USED SO MUCH IN CONNECTION WITH A PERSON'S NAME HE SAID IN A NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR INTERVIEW
46hc040c PEOPLE THINK THE A. IN A. ROBERT ABBOUD STANDS FOR ABRASIVE
46hc040d IN AMSTERDAM STOCKS CLOSED LOWER IN VOLATILE TRADING
46hc040e SELECTED ISSUES ENDED OFF THEIR INTRADAY LOWS THOUGH AFTER WALL STREET'S LOWER OPENING PROVED LESS SEVERE THAN SOME DUTCH FORECASTERS ANTICIPATED DEALERS SAID
46hc040f VOLATILE TRADING THROUGHOUT THE SESSION PRODUCED WIDE PRICE FLUCTUATIONS <NOISE> AS DUTCH INSTITUTIONS BARGAIN HUNTED WHILE OVERSEAS INVESTORS TENDED TO SELL SHARES
46hc040g RATES ARE DETERMINED BY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PURCHASE PRICE AND FACE VALUE
46hc040h THUS HIGHER BIDDING NARROWS THE INVESTOR'S RETURN WHILE LOWER BIDDING WIDENS IT
46hc040i THE PERCENTAGE RATES ARE CALCULATED ON A THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY DAY YEAR WHILE THE COUPON EQUIVALENT YIELD IS BASED ON A THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE DAY YEAR
46hc040j TECHNICALLY THE STOPGAP BILL WILL LEAVE THE GOVERNMENT OUT OF MONEY OVER THE WEEKEND
46hc040k BUT THAT SHOULD HAVE LITTLE PRACTICAL EFFECT SINCE MOST OPERATIONS WILL BE CLOSED DURING THAT TIME
46hc040l CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS HOPE HOWEVER IT WILL PRESSURE LAWMAKERS TO FINISH THEIR WORK BEFORE MONDAY
46hc040m SOME MONTHS BEFORE THE CRASH INTEREST RATES STARTED TO MOVE UP
46hc040n HOME MORTGAGE RATES WENT UP ALMOST TEN TIMES AS FAST AS THEY CAME DOWN
46hc040o THE MONEY SUPPLY GROWTH WAS MUDDLING AT OR BELOW THE LOWER END OF THE TARGET RANGE A PHENOMENON WE HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED FOR MANY YEARS
46hc040p FOR A SHIP OR MISSILE GUIDED BY THE WRONG TIME SIGNAL THAT LITTLE GAP COULD MEAN ARRIVING AT THE WRONG DESTINATION
46hc040q IF WE LET THE DIFFERENCE GROW SAYS MR. MCCARTHY WE COULD RUN INTO PROBLEMS OVER THOUSANDS OF YEARS
46hc040r IT MIGHT BE NOON BY ATOMIC TIME BUT DARK OUTSIDE
46hc040s THIS HEADY MIXTURE OF PIETY AND GUTTER FIGHTING WE FEAR IS LIKELY TO DETRACT FROM CAUSES WE WOULD LIKE TO ADVANCE
46hc040t THIS IS PERFECTLY ILLUSTRATED BY MR. ROBERTSON'S CHARGE THAT THERE ARE RUSSIAN INTERMEDIATE RANGE MISSILES IN CUBA
46hc040u IT IS PERFECTLY TRUE THAT THE I. N. F. TREATY GIVES US NO RIGHTS TO INSPECT FOR MISSILES IN THE SOVIET'S ISLAND SATELLITE
46hc040v AND IT IS TRUE THAT SOVIET BASES THERE ARE A DANGER TO THE U. S.
46hc040w BUT TO POSE THESE VALID ISSUES IN THE MOST INFLAMMATORY WAY MR. ROBERTSON HAS CHARGED THAT THE MISSILES ARE ALREADY DEPLOYED AND IN PLACE
46hc040x IF THIS IS PRESENTED AS THE ISSUE THE ANSWER IS NO AND THE VALID POINTS ARE LOST
46hc040y KAISER'S PRESENT VALUE IS EQUALLY UNCERTAIN THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT ITS NET WORTH IS AT LEAST A NEGATIVE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION
46hc040z IN ITS LAWSUITS AGAINST FORMER MANAGEMENT THE COMPANY IS SEEKING DAMAGES OF MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED MILLION FOR ALLEGED SELF DEALING AND MISMANAGEMENT
46hc0410 IN THE PROCESS THE SUITS ALLEGE ASSETS WERE OVERSTATED AND LIABILITIES UNDERSTATED
46hc0411 THE SHORTAGE OF WESTERN CAPACITY MAKES SOVIET LAUNCHERS ATTRACTIVE
46hc0412 <NOISE> A SERIES OF LAUNCH DISASTERS INCLUDING THE CHALLENGER EXPLOSION SEVERELY CURTAILED WESTERN ACCESS TO SPACE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX TO EIGHTY SEVEN
46hc0413 THE EUROPEAN ARIANE LAUNCHER JUST RETURNED TO COMMERCIAL SERVICE
46hc0414 THE U. S. SPACE PROGRAM WILL NOT ELIMINATE ITS BACKLOG OF PAYLOADS UNTIL THE EARLY NINETEEN NINETIES
46hc0415 YOU THINK THAT'S WEIRD
46hc0416 THINK AGAIN
46hc0417 HE'S NOT ALONE
46hc0418 CARBIDE'S SABOTAGE THEORY IS WEAKENED PARTLY BECAUSE IT HASN'T DISCLOSED ALL ITS EVIDENCE
46hc0419 <NOISE> THOUGH ITS ATTORNEYS SAY THEY HAVE INTERVIEWED THE ALLEGED SABOTEUR EXTENSIVELY THEY WON'T DISCLOSE HIS NAME OR WHEREABOUTS OR DESCRIBE HIM
46hc041a THEY ALSO DECLINE TO SAY WHETHER THEY UNDERSTAND HIS MOTIVES OR HAVE ANY WITNESSES
46hc041b THE ONE ELEMENT OF SUSPENSE REMAINS THE SELECTION OF A RUNNING MATE FOR VICE PRESIDENT BUSH'S PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN
46hc041c BUSH MANAGERS INSIST THEY WON'T DISCLOSE THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE'S IDENTITY UNTIL THURSDAY MORNING
46hc041d <NOISE> REAGAN ARRIVED AT THE CONVENTION SITE LAST NIGHT AND PREPARED FOR HIS FAREWELL SPEECH TO THE PARTY TONIGHT
46hc041e TH- THE PRESIDENT LEAVES FOR CALIFORNIA TOMORROW AND BUSH WILL ARRIVE TO TAKE CONTROL OF THE CONVENTION
46hc041f IT IS A CRUCIAL TIME IN WHICH BUSH MUST ATTEMPT TO MOVE OUT FROM UNDER REAGAN'S SHADOW AND ESTABLISH HIS OWN IDENTITY
46ic0201 PHIL WALTERS WHOSE BACK YARD WOULD HAVE FACED THE PROPOSED SHELTER SAYS HE WENT TO MEETINGS TO LEARN BOTH SIDES OF THE SHELTER DEBATE
46ic0202 BUT JUST FOR WANTING TO HEAR THE PROS AND CONS I BECAME A PRO DERELICT REVOLUTIONARY IN THE EYES OF SOME PEOPLE HE RECALLS
46ic0203 THEY DIDN'T WANT AN OBJECTIVE STUDY
46ic0204 THEY JUST WANTED TO PREVENT THE ONSLAUGHT OF THE BUMS
46ic0205 <NOISE> FRANCE FUND INC. HAD A NET ASSET VALUE OF FOURTEEN DOLLARS AND FORTY SIX CENTS AND A CLOSING PRICE OF TEN AND ONE EIGHTH AS OF THURSDAY
46ic0206 GABELLI EQUITY TRUST INC. HAD A NET ASSET VALUE OF NINE DOLLARS THIRTY SIX CENTS AND A CLOSING PRICE OF EIGHT AND SEVEN EIGHTHS AS OF FRIDAY
46ic0207 IN THE LISTING OF PUBLICLY TRADED FUNDS IN AN EARLIER EDITION THE LINES WERE REVERSED
46ic0208 BANCROFT CONVERTIBLE FUND INC. HAD A NET ASSET VALUE OF TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS EIGHTY EIGHT CENTS AND A CLOSING PRICE OF TWENTY SEVEN AND A FOURTH AS OF FRIDAY
46ic0209 <NOISE> IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SOME GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES C. I. A. HAD TO GIVE UP FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS
46ic020a <NOISE> NOW IT IS SUGGESTED THAT OFFICIALS GIVE UP FIFTH AMENDMENT RIGHTS
46ic020b IN NINETEEN NINETY SOMEONE IS GOING TO SUGGEST THAT GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS GIVE UP THEIR FOURTH AMENDMENT RIGHTS PROTECTING THEM FROM UNLAWFUL SEARCHES
46ic020c WHY NOT
46ic020d THEY MAY BE HIDING IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS IN THEIR HOMES
46ic020e <NOISE> CABLE OPERATORS ARE WILLING PARTICIPANTS IN THE PRICE CUTTING PROGRAMS
46ic020f FOR ONE THING BECAUSE OF DEREGULATION WHICH TOOK EFFECT JANUARY FIRST <NOISE> THE OPERATORS HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO RAISE RATES FOR BASIC CABLE SERVICE
46ic020g IN ADDITION THE PAY NETWORKS ARE CUTTING THE PRICES THEY CHARGE OPERATORS
46ic020h CONGRESS GAVE THE SPACE AGENCY'S PLAN MIXED REVIEWS
46ic020i <NOISE> REP. BILL LOWERY REPUBLICAN CALIFORNIA WHO HAS BEEN OUTSPOKEN ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF SECURING A SECOND BOOSTER ROCKET SUPPLIER PRAISED THE PLAN
46ic020j COMPETITION FUELS EXCELLENCE HE SAID AND THIS IS THE FIRST STEP TOWARD A SOLID ROCKET MOTOR WITH BETTER SAFETY PRECAUTIONS AND MORE EFFICIENT PRODUCTION
46ic020k <NOISE> ENERGY EXPERTS CONSIDER AMOCO AND EXXON AMONG THE INDUSTRY'S HEALTHIEST COMPANIES FINANCIALLY WITH STRONG CREDIT RATINGS AND LOW DEBT
46ic020l <NOISE> AMOCO'S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHOW IT HAD FOUR HUNDRED FORTY ONE MILLION IN CASH AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES ON HAND AT THE CLOSE OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
46ic020m <NOISE> IN RECENT TALKS WITH ANALYSTS AMOCO OFFICIALS HAVE SAID THE COMPANY IS WELL POSITIONED FINANCIALLY <NOISE> IF IT DECIDES TO MAKE AN ACQUISITION
46ic020n MOREOVER A WESTERN FIRM HAS TO MAKE SOME CALCULATION OF WHETHER MR. GORBACHEV <NOISE> WILL SUCCEED IN HIS EFFORTS TO ACTIVATE THE SOVIET WORK FORCE
46ic020o PAST EXPERIENCE AND CURRENT REPORTS INDICATE THAT HIS CHANCES AREN'T GOOD
46ic020p <NOISE> ROWLAND EVANS AND ROBERT NOVAK REPORTED <NOISE> FROM MOSCOW LAST WEEK THAT PARTY APPARATCHIKS AND DISAFFECTED SOVIET WORKERS ALREADY ARE UNDERMINING REFORMS
46ic020q <NOISE> THE GOVERNMENT FACES A KNOTTY SURPLUS PROBLEM
46ic020r U. S. STORAGE BINS HOLD ROUGHLY AN EIGHT MONTH SUPPLY OF CORN AND A TEN MONTH SUPPLY OF WHEAT WHEN A THREE MONTH SUPPLY WOULD DO
46ic020s <NOISE> MAKING MATTERS WORSE THE HARVEST RIPENING IN THE FIELDS PROMISES TO BE A MONSTER PORTENDING RECORD POST HARVEST SUPPLIES OF CORN AND A GLUT OF OTHER COMMODITIES
46ic020t <NOISE> TO HELP CUT PRODUCTION THE U. S. IS PAYING FARMERS AN ANNUAL RENT FOR TEN YEARS TO IDLE EROSION PRONE CROP LAND UNDER A CONSERVATION RESERVE PROGRAM
46ic020u HUMANA TRIED TO DEFEND ITSELF THROUGH DIVERSIFICATION AS DID THE OTHER LARGE CHAINS HOSPITAL CORP. OF AMERICA AMERICAN MEDICAL INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL MEDICAL ENTERPRISES INC.
46ic020v <NOISE> THE IDEA WAS THAT IF A HOSPITAL OWNER ALSO HAD AN INSURANCE PLAN IT COULD STEER PATIENTS TO ITS INSTITUTIONS THROUGH FINANCIAL INCENTIVES
46ic020w THE PATIENT POOL MIGHT SHRINK BUT THE COMPANY COULD GRAB A BIGGER PART OF IT
46ic020x <NOISE> KEMP'S CAMPAIGN TAKES ON AN INCREASINGLY DESPERATE TONE
46ic020y IN ONE SURE SIGN OF A CANDIDACY IN TROUBLE HE LASHES OUT AT CRITICISM FROM A HIGHLY REGARDED T. V. COMMENTATOR
46ic020z <NOISE> EVEN SOME SUPPORTERS NOW SAY PRIVATELY THAT HE SHOULD AIM FOR THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION
46ic0210 <NOISE> BUT HIS LONGTIME HOSTILITIES WITH DOLE LEAVE A SPOT ON A BUSH TICKET AS ABOUT THE ONLY POSSIBILITY
46ic0211 WE NEVER HAD ONE BEFORE MR. TIMBERS SAID
46ic0212 <NOISE> A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF OUR CLIENTS WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THAT OPTION
46ic0213 <NOISE> IT'S NOT NECESSARILY A MARKET CALL
46ic0214 MR. TIMBERS SAYS HE'S FAIRLY AMBIVALENT ABOUT THE PRICE OF GOLD NEAR TERM
46ic0215 <NOISE> HE DOES SEE HOWEVER HIGHER INFLATION OF FIVE PERCENT OR SO IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE UP FROM FOUR PERCENT THIS YEAR
46ic0216 A GOLD OPTION COULD BE A NICE ALTERNATIVE FOR FIXED INCOME INVESTORS SHOULD INFLATION FEARS ARISE MR. TIMBERS SAYS
46ic0217 <NOISE> BUT HE WARNS THAT COMPANIES SHOULD ASK HOW MUCH STOCK IS TOO MUCH
46ic0218 <NOISE> A DIRECTOR HOLDING A LARGE BLOCK MAY BECOME MORE INTERESTED IN SHORT TERM RESULTS THAN LONG TERM CORPORATE <NOISE> HEALTH
46ic0219 THAT DIRECTOR MAY ALSO BE MORE TEMPTED TO VOTE HIS POCKETBOOK IN A TAKEOVER *FIGHT* SAYS
46ic021a <NOISE> AS BRITAIN'S FLAG CARRIER THE AIRLINE INHERITED A VAST ROUTE NETWORK
46ic021b <NOISE> BRITISH CALEDONIAN BROUGHT ROUTES TO THE SOUTHERN U. S. THE MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA AS WELL AS LUCRATIVE FLIGHTS TO EAST ASIA
46ic021c <NOISE> BRITISH AIRWAYS GAVE UP ONLY A FEW ROUTES FROM GATWICK TO EUROPEAN CITIES WHICH IN MOST CASES IT ALREADY SERVED FROM HEATHROW
46ic021d <NOISE> MR. BAKER IS ALSO WELL ACQUAINTED WITH RUDOLPH GIULIANI <NOISE> THE U. S. ATTORNEY FOR MANHATTAN WHO IS OVERSEEING THAT OFFICE'S INVESTIGATION OF DREXEL
46ic021e AS WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF MR. BAKER OFFERED MR. GIULIANI THE CHAIRMANSHIP OF THE S. E. C. IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
46ic021f MR. GIULIANI DECLINED THE POST WHICH WAS LATER ACCEPTED BY DAVID S. RUDER
46ic0301 <NOISE> <NOISE> ALL THE GAINS THAT WE'RE MAKING ARE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL SAYS F. JAMES MCDONALD G. M.'S PRESIDENT
46ic0302 THAT MAY BE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING HAPPENING IN HEAVY INDUSTRY IN THE U. S. TODAY
46ic0303 INDEED THE ERA OF BIG TIME NATIONAL LABOR TALKS IN WHICH UNION AND MANAGEMENT LEADERS BUTT HEADS OVER PENNIES AN HOUR IS WANING
46ic0304 <NOISE> ALSO SELLING WELL WAS A FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR ISSUE OF REVENUE BONDS BY THE FLORIDA DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES

46lc030d SOME COST CUTTING EFFORTS HAVE WORSENED LABOR DISPUTES WHICH HAVE IN TURN PITTED NON UNION PILOTS AGAINST PRO UNION PILOTS
46lc030e FIRST OFFICER GUY CASEY WAS ONCE A CAPTAIN AT CONTINENTAL BUT LOST HIS SENIORITY DURING THE BITTER STRIKE THERE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE WHICH HE HAD HELPED TO ORGANIZE
46lc030f HE SAYS HE WANTS TO PUT THE EXPERIENCE BEHIND HIM
46lc030g <NOISE> ANALYSTS ALSO SAID THEY HADN'T EXPECTED LOWER OPERATING PROFITS FOR THE COMPANY'S INDUSTRIES GROUP AND FOR THE BROADCASTING SEGMENT
46lc030h WESTINGHOUSE OFFICIALS TOLD ANALYSTS THAT OPERATING PROFIT IN THE INDUSTRIES GROUP FELL FIFTEEN PERCENT TO TWENTY PERCENT HURT IN PART BY WEAK RESULTS IN CANADIAN OPERATIONS
46lc030i A SHARP DROP IN OPERATING PROFIT FROM THE BROADCASTING GROUP'S PRODUCTION COMPANY CONTRIBUTED TO THE SLIGHTLY LOWER OPERATING EARNINGS OVERALL FOR THAT SEGMENT
46lc030j THE SPOKESMAN ALSO SAID THE LEAGUE'S OWNERS ARE COMMITTED TO PLAYING WITH THEIR CURRENT REPLACEMENT ROSTERS FOR THE REST OF THE SEASON INCLUDING THE SUPER BOWL IF NECESSARY
46lc030k THAT MAY BE THE CASE IF MR. UPSHAW CAN BE TAKEN AT HIS WORD
46lc030l HE HAS SAID THAT THE PLAYERS WILL REMAIN ON STRIKE FOR THE DURATION IF THE UNION'S OFFER WAS REJECTED
46lc030m THE SOVIETS OBVIOUSLY WANT TO MAKE IT AS DIFFICULT AS POSSIBLE FOR NATO TO CARRY OUT ITS MODERNIZATION SAID ONE WESTERN DIPLOMAT IN BONN
46lc030n A SENIOR NATO DIPLOMAT ACCUSED THE SOVIETS OF TRYING TO SEDUCE THE GERMANS AWAY FROM US
46lc030o IT IS NONE TOO SUBTLE WEDGE DRIVING HE TOLD REUTERS
46lc030p WE'VE NEVER HAD ONE BEFORE MR. TIMBERS SAID
46lc030q A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF OUR CLIENTS WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THAT OPTION
46lc030r IT'S NOT NECESSARILY A MARKET CALL
46lc030s MR. TIMBERS SAYS HE'S FAIRLY AMBIVALENT ABOUT THE PRICE OF GOLD NEAR TERM
46lc030t HE DOES SEE HOWEVER HIGHER INFLATION OF FIVE PERCENT OR SO IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE UP FROM FOUR PERCENT THIS YEAR
46lc030u A GOLD OPTION COULD BE A NICE ALTERNATIVE FOR FIXED INCOME INVESTORS SHOULD INFLATION FEARS ARISE MR. TIMBERS SAYS
46lc030v SOME ECONOMISTS SAY INFLATIONARY PRESSURES COULD CONTINUE TO PUSH UP U. S. INTEREST RATES THIS YEAR
46lc030w IF SO FOREIGN CENTRAL BANKS MAY SEE THAT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO TIGHTEN AND TO ADDRESS THEIR OWN INFLATION WORRIES DESPITE U. S. CONCERN
46lc030x ONE FEAR SAYS IRVING TRUST ECONOMIST ROBERT MCGEE IS THAT HIGHER GLOBAL RATES WILL SEND THE FINANCIAL MARKETS INTO A TAILSPIN
46lc030y A SIMILAR VIEW IS HELD BY GRETA E. MARSHALL INVESTMENT MANAGER OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC EMPLOYEES' RETIREMENT SYSTEM WHICH MANAGES ABOUT FORTY FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS
46lc030z I STILL SEE NO EVIDENCE THAT INFLATION IS PICKING UP SUBSTANTIALLY SHE SAYS
46lc0310 THE ECONOMY DOESN'T LOOK SO STRONG THAT IT WILL REKINDLE INFLATION SO I WOULD VIEW ANY FURTHER DROP IN BOND PRICES AS A BUYING OPPORTUNITY
46lc0311 ALAS THEY PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE DEVOTED A LITTLE MORE THOUGHT TO WINNEBAGO'S PAST
46lc0312 THE COMPANY HAD A HISTORY OF CARNAGE AT THE TOP RUNNING THROUGH FIVE DIFFERENT CHIEF EXECUTIVES IN THE FOURTEEN YEARS BEFORE MESSRS.
46lc0313 GILBERT AND BERRETH STROLLED INTO TOWN
46lc0314 IN ONE OF THOSE SHAKE UPS WINNEBAGO'S CHAIRMAN AND FOUNDER JOHN K. HANSON SACKED HIS OWN SON
46lc0315 HERE ARE PRICE TRENDS ON THE WORLD'S MAJOR STOCK MARKETS AS CALCULATED BY MORGAN STANLEY CAPITAL INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE GENEVA
46lc0316 TO MAKE THEM DIRECTLY COMPARABLE EACH INDEX IS BASED ON THE CLOSE OF NINETEEN SIXTY NINE EQUALING ONE HUNDRED
46lc0317 THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE IS SINCE YEAR END
46lc0318 AFTER NEARLY EIGHT YEARS OF THE REAGAN PRESIDENCY A KIND OF MORNING AFTER MOOD PREVAILS HERE
46lc0319 THERE IS A SENSE THAT MR. REAGAN'S SUCCESSOR HASN'T ANY CHOICE BUT TO BE A CONSOLIDATION PRESIDENT
46lc031a GIVEN BUDGET CONSTRAINTS AND A RE ENERGIZED CONGRESS SOME HERE BELIEVE A BUSH ADMINISTRATION MAY NOT BE ALL THAT DIFFERENT FROM A DUKAKIS ADMINISTRATION
46lc031b SOME OF THAT CASH HAS BEEN USED FOR BONUS PAYMENTS
46lc031c WAGES AND BONUSES ROSE NINETEEN PERCENT IN THE FIRST HALF A RATE THAT FAR OUTPACED ECONOMIC GROWTH AND EXERTED UPWARD PRESSURE ON PRICES
46lc031d CHINA'S ECONOMY GREW AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF FIVE POINT SEVEN PERCENT IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS ROUGHLY HALF THE AVERAGE ANNUAL RATE IN THE PAST DECADE
46lc0401 TEXAS STARTED EVALUATING POTENTIAL S. S. C. SITES ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO AND NOW HAS SOLID DATA ON SIX LOCATIONS SAYS DILLARD HAMMETT STATE ENERGY ADVISER

46lc0403 <NOISE> CONSIDERING THE STATE'S FLAT RELATIVELY EARTHQUAKE FREE LANDSCAPE MR. HAMMETT SAYS NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF TEXAS COULD HAVE THE SITE
46lc0404 THE BANKS SOUGHT TO ELIMINATE A MISMATCH BETWEEN THEIR ASSETS PREDOMINANTLY HELD IN NON POUND CURRENCIES AND THEIR CAPITAL KEPT IN POUNDS
46lc0405 WHEN THE POUND WAS WEAK DURING THE EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTIES THE VALUE OF SCANDINAVIAN BANK'S CAPITAL FELL STEEPLY IN PROPORTION TO ITS NON DOLLAR ASSETS
46lc0406 THE BANKS THAT OWNED SCANDINAVIAN BANK HAD TO INJECT ABOUT FORTY SEVEN POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS OF ADDITIONAL CAPITAL
46lc0407 ALSO THE STRONG RISE IN SHARE PRICES IN RECENT WEEKS APPEARS TO HAVE DISCOUNTED MOST OF THE GOOD NEWS LIKELY IN THE BUDGET ANOTHER DEALER SAID
46lc0408 <NOISE> IT'S GOING TO TAKE QUITE A LOT TO MOVE IT SHARPLY AHEAD FROM THIS LEVEL HE SAID
46lc0409 THE HUNDRED SHARE INDEX IS UP EIGHTEEN POINT SIX PERCENT THIS YEAR
46lc040a THE BOOK HE SAYS WILL BE ABOUT ARVIDA AND GENERALLY ABOUT COMPANIES SNARED IN THE TAKEOVER GAME
46lc040b IT'LL ASK SOME POINTED QUESTIONS IS THERE VALUE ADDED IN CORPORATE MERGERS
46lc040c DOES PRODUCTIVITY INCREASE AND WHAT HAPPENS TO THE PEOPLE INVOLVED
46lc040d THE PREMIER SAID IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR MR. GHAFAR TO REMAIN AS HIS DEPUTY
46lc040e I HAVE TRUST IN HIM
46lc040f I CHOSE HIM DIDN'T I
46lc040g DOCTOR MAHATHIR SAID
46lc040h S. D. I. PERPETUATES THE ILLUSION THAT MORE WEAPONS EQUALS MORE SECURITY
46lc040i OUR DEPENDENCE UPON VIOLENCE TO RESOLVE CONFLICT IS A SHORT RUN SOLUTION TO A LONG TERM PROBLEM
46lc040j IN ORDER TO ENSURE OUR SURVIVAL WE MUST CHANGE THE WAY WE THINK ABOUT CONFLICT
46lc040k BY SPENDING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON DEVELOPING NONVIOLENT MEANS OF RESOLVING CONFLICT WE CAN BUILD A WORLD BEYOND WAR AND A SUSTAINABLE SECURE FUTURE FOR ALL PEOPLE
46lc040l STEVEN M. KINCAID PRESIDENT SAID KINCAID'S BOARD WOULD REVIEW THE ANNOUNCEMENT WHEN IT MEETS SOMETIME IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS
46lc040m HE DECLINED TO COMMENT FURTHER
46lc040n HE SAID HE AND HIS FATHER J. WADE KINCAID WHO IS CHAIRMAN OWN A TOTAL OF ABOUT SIX POINT FOUR PERCENT OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON
46lc040o ART COLLECTORS AND DEALERS HEAVED A SIGH OF RELIEF LAST NIGHT
46lc040p AFTER HIGH PRICES AND FRANTIC BIDDING AT ART AUCTIONS LAST SPRING ABOUT ONE IN FOUR WORKS DIDN'T SELL AT A CONTEMPORARY ART AUCTION AT CHRISTIE'S
46lc040q BUT AT LEAST THE MARKET DIDN'T CRASH
46lc040r GEMFIBROZIL HAS LONG BEEN KNOWN TO INCREASE H. D. L. BUT UNTIL THIS REPORT ITS EFFECT ON HEART DISEASE WAS UNCLEAR
46lc040s AVAILABLE IN THE U. S. SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO GEMFIBROZIL GAINED ONLY LIMITED USE

46lc040x SONY ROSE TWENTY TO FOUR THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY
46lc040y CERTAIN ELEMENTS OF A NATIONAL SYSTEM WERE OBVIOUS AND QUICKLY MADE THEIR WAY INTO USE
46lc040z THE FIRST WAS A COMPOSITE TAPE THAT BROUGHT INFORMATION FROM VARIOUS MARKET CENTERS ONTO ONE TICKER TAPE
46lc0410 A COMPOSITE QUOTATION DISPLAY SYSTEM SOON FOLLOWED ALLOWING CUSTOMERS AND BROKERS TO SEE QUOTES FROM ALL MARKETS ON A SINGLE SCREEN
46lc0411 AND AN INTERMARKET TRADING SYSTEM ALLOWED ORDERS COMING TO VARIOUS EXCHANGE FLOORS TO FLOW FROM ONE EXCHANGE TO ANOTHER QUICKLY EASILY AND AT NO COST
46lc0412 IN MY ORIGINAL SQUAD I'M THE ONLY ONE LEFT UNHARMED
46lc0413 IN MY PLATOON THERE'S ONLY THIRTEEN OF US

46lc0415 ISRAELI DEFENSE MINISTER RABIN SAID HE HAD MET WITH PALESTINIANS TO SEARCH FOR WAYS TO END VIOLENCE IN THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES

46lc0417 ISRAEL'S ARMY SAID TWO HUNDRED SEVEN PALESTINIANS HAVE BEEN KILLED IN THE UNREST
46lc0418 PRUDENTIAL INSURANCE COMPANY OF AMERICA WHICH PARTICIPATED IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE BUY OUT HOLDS ABOUT A THIRTY PERCENT STAKE IN FOODMAKER

46lc041a -CERTAIN FOODMAKER EXECUTIVES ALSO MAY BUY STAKES IN F. M. ACQUISITION THE COMPANY SAID
46lc041b IN OTHER DEVELOPMENTS CORN AND WHEAT PRICES WERE MOSTLY HIGHER IN A REBOUND FROM MONDAY'S SESSION WHEN CORN SET NEW LIFE OF CONTRACT LOWS
46lc041c MANY TRADERS BOUGHT CONTRACTS TO COVER SHORT OR SELLING POSITIONS
46lc041d ANALYSTS SAID TECHNICAL FACTORS ALSO PLAYED A PART AS PRICES BACKED AND FILLED THE GAPS LEFT ON PRICE CHARTS BY MONDAY'S STEEP DROP
46mc0201 KIDDER PEABODY FOUNDED FOUR YEARS EARLIER LONG HAS BEEN A SOCIALLY WELL CONNECTED AND PROFITABLE INVESTMENT BANK
46mc0202 BUT ITS POWER ON WALL STREET EBBED IN RECENT YEARS AS IT WAS OVERTAKEN BY LARGER MORE AGGRESSIVE FIRMS
46mc0203 KIDDER OFFICIALS HAVE RECENTLY HOPED THAT ITS LINK WITH GENERAL ELECTRIC AND G. E.'S LARGE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL <NOISE> WOULD RESTORE IT TO ITS EARLIER PREEMINENCE
46mc0204 <NOISE> WE HAD TO SCOUR THE EARTH TO ACHIEVE THAT SETTLEMENT MR. LIEBERMANN SAID
46mc0205 <NOISE> BUT THROUGH IT ALL RALPH WAS CALM AND RATIONAL
46mc0206 HE DOESN'T PANIC WHEN THINGS START TO GO WRONG

46mc020d WE'VE ENTERED A PERIOD WHERE ECONOMIC FORCES ARE PRODUCING TREMENDOUS STRAINS ON BUSINESS SAYS LAWRENCE O'BRIEN A TAX LOBBYIST

46mc0217 WHEN MR. FAIR PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF HIS EQUATION TODAY IT STILL SHOWS A FORD VICTORY BUT BY A LESS EMBARRASSING MARGIN

46mc030r <NOISE> THE CUOMO PLAN DOESN'T STOP AT GOUGING NEW YORK TAXPAYERS AND LONG ISLAND RATEPAYERS
46mc030s FEDERAL TAXPAYERS ALSO WILL CONTRIBUTE
46mc030t THE KEY TO THE DEAL IS THAT LILCO ALSO WOULD GET A TWO POINT FIVE BILLION TAX WRITE OFF FOR SHOREHAM
46mc030u THIS WOULD GUARANTEE THAT THE UTILITY WON'T HAVE TO PAY ANY FEDERAL TAXES FOR AT LEAST A DECADE
46mc030v <NOISE> NEW YORK ALSO WOULD HELP LILCO FLOAT ONE HUNDRED MILLION IN TAX EXEMPT INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT BONDS TO HELP PAY FOR THE CLEANUP
46mc030w MAKE THAT DE INDUSTRIALIZATION BONDS

46nc020s BUT EVEN WITHOUT THE RESERVES THE COMPANY SAID EARNINGS WOULD HAVE BEEN FLAT AT ABOUT EIGHTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS COMPARED WITH THE YEAR EARLIER QUARTER
46nc020t <NOISE> FIRST INTERSTATE HAD A SLIGHT DECLINE IN EARNINGS ASSETS AND NEGLIGIBLE GROWTH IN NET INTEREST INCOME

46nc020w REVENUE FELL TWO PERCENT IN THE LATEST PERIOD TO ONE POINT FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS FROM ONE POINT FIFTY THREE BILLION DOLLARS
46nc020x THE REVENUE DECLINE CAME FROM PILLSBURY'S RESTAURANT BUSINESS
46nc020y THAT'S A BUSINESS DECISION THAT THE MANAGER HAS TO MAKE MR. KEANE SAYS
46nc020z IT'S GOING TO AFFECT HIS RETURN

46nc030p IN THE TWO SELECTED AREAS THE STATE WILL ALLOW PROCUREMENT AND RETAIL PRICES TO RISE TO WHAT THE OPEN MARKET DEMANDS
46nc030q THE SUBSIDY FOR CONSUMERS IS MEANT TO REDUCE THE STRAIN ON URBAN RESIDENTS
46nc030r <NOISE> FARMERS OF COURSE WILL GET HIGHER PRICES FOR THEIR GRAIN FROM THE MARKET WHICH IN TURN SHOULD INDUCE THEM TO INCREASE PRODUCTION
46nc030s GRAIN PRODUCTION THROUGHOUT CHINA HAS FALTERED IN RECENT YEARS IN PART BECAUSE STATE PROCUREMENT PRICES WERE TOO LOW

46nc030z WITH THIS YEAR'S SMALL ACREAGE INCREASES WEATHER AND SPRING PLANTING CONDITIONS ARE MAJOR CONCERNS TO A MARKET THAT IS BEGINNING TO SHAKE OFF A HUGE SURPLUS

46nc0312 LAST YEAR YOU HAD TUMULTUOUS SWINGS IN THE MARKETS THEMSELVES HE SAYS
46nc0313 THIS YEAR THE ENVIRONMENT WILL BE NARROWER SWINGS BUT VOLUME WILL BE LOWER WITH REVENUES INSUFFICIENT TO COVER COSTS
46nc0314 MORE IMPORTANT THAN ARITHMETIC HOWEVER IS MR. JACKSON'S MESSAGE
46nc0315 SPEAKING TO BLACK ASPIRATIONS HE REPRESENTS THE BEST OF THE AMERICAN DREAM
46nc0316 <NOISE> HE MIGHT EVEN QUALIFY AS A SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE IF NOT FOR HIS ENDORSEMENT OF HOMOSEXUAL RIGHTS
46nc0317 ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE GENERAL STRIKE FACTORIES CLOSED BUT BOOKSTORES REMAINED OPEN IN THIS OLD WORLD CULTURAL CENTER
46nc0318 MOST SCHOOLS WERE SHUT BUT PUSHKIN STREET NEAR THE SQUARE REVERBERATED AS USUAL WITH THE SOUND OF BADLY PLAYED CHOPIN EMANATING FROM THE OPEN WINDOWS OF THE MUSIC ACADEMY

46nc031b THEIR POLITICAL DEMANDS INCLUDE CALLS FOR A SEPARATE ARMY *BRIGADE* AND THE RIGHT FOR ARMENIA TO HAVE CONSULATES ABROAD

46nc040b <NOISE> MANY AGREE THERE IS LITTLE TIME TO WASTE IN THE SCRAMBLE TO CREATE BETTER INTERNATIONAL REGULATION
46nc040c AS MR. FELDSTEIN SAYS YOU CAN'T JUST LOOK AT THE BUILDING AND SAY IT HASN'T FALLEN DOWN YET SO WE SHOULD BE SAFE
46nc040d WITH THE INITIAL FINANCING COMPLETE L. S. I. LOOKED ABROAD IN FEBRUARY NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO FOR ITS NEXT INFUSION

46nc040g <NOISE> IF YOU LOOK AT THE RECORD THE DEBATE SHOULD BE RATHER SHORT
46nc040h THE WINNERS OBVIOUS
46nc040i <NOISE> THE ONLY TRAGEDY AND IT'S AN AMAZING ONE IS THAT MOST AMERICANS DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED AND HOW IT CAME ABOUT
46nc040j BUT INSIDE ROOM SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTEEN THE JAPANESE SEE THE SITUATION SOMEWHAT DIFFERENTLY
46nc040k THEY REASON LIKE THIS IF THE U. S. IMPOSES SANCTIONS THEY MOST LIKELY WILL BE AIMED AT JAPANESE CONSTRUCTION COMPANIES DOING BUSINESS IN THE U. S.
46nc040l BUT THAT WOULD HURT THOUSANDS OF AMERICAN WORKERS WHO ARE EMPLOYED EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY BY SUCH COMPANIE(S)-

46nc040q MR. TANAKA WAS AMONG THE FIRST SCIENTISTS TO RECOGNIZE THE POTENTIAL OF SUPERCONDUCTORS <NOISE> WHICH ARE SUBSTANCES THAT CAN CARRY ELECTRICITY WITH NO RESISTANCE AND THUS NO LOSS OF POWER
46nc040r IF MADE PRACTICAL THEY COULD BRING SPECTACULAR CHANGES TO ALMOST ANY ELECTRICAL PRODUCT OR PROCESS
46nc040s THAT COULD MEAN VASTLY FASTER AND MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT PRODUCTS SUCH AS COMPUTERS CARS AND HOUSEHOLD APPLIANCES
46nc040t UNTIL THE RECENT BREAKTHROUGH SUPERCONDUCTORS HAD TO BE CHILLED TO A HOPELESSLY LOW TEMPERATURE TO WORK SO EXCEPT FOR A FEW APPLICATIONS THERE REALLY WAS NO TECHNOLOGY
46nc040u MR. IACOCCA SAID THAT WHILE THE PRICING ACTIONS INCREASED SALES THEY ALSO SQUEEZED CHRYSLER'S PROFIT MARGINS
46nc040v BUT HE ADDED THAT THE NUMBER THREE U. S. AUTO MAKER MADE A CONSCIOUS DECISION TO SACRIFICE PROFIT FOR A HIGHER MARKET S- SHARE
46nc040w THE MOVE IS BEHIND CHRYSLER'S RECENT DECISIONS TO INCREASE PRODUCTION WHICH IN TURN WILL BOOST PROFIT FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR
46nc040x <NOISE> CRITICS ARGUE THAT HE MAY BE OVERLY OPTIMISTIC THOUGH
46nc040y AND MR. DUKAKIS IS CERTAIN TO FACE MORE PRESSURE ON THE QUESTION FROM VICE PRESIDENT BUSH WHO SUPPORTS BOTH THE M. X. AND MIDGETMAN
46nc040z MOREOVER MOST OF THE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS BEING CONSIDERED AS POTENTIAL RUNNING MATES FOR GOVERNOR DUKAKIS HAVE BACKED ONE OR THE OTHER MISSILE PLANS
46nc0410 THE DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION BILL PENDING IN CONGRESS IS EXPECTED TO RUN OFF ANY DECISION UNTIL A NEW ADMINISTRATION TAKES OFFICE NEXT YEAR

46pc0317 AS FOR THE U. S. COMMENTS ON GERMAN INFLATION A TYPICAL GERMAN MIGHT RESPOND ZERO INFLATION
46pc0318 WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT

46tc0206 MR. JOYNES WILL OVERSEE THE COMPANY'S OPERATING UNITS AS WELL AS THE COMPANY'S RESEARCH ACTIVITIES AND STAFF SUPPORT SERVICES THE COMPANY SAID

46tc020c <NOISE> THE LASTEST DISCLOSURES ARE AN OUTGROWTH OF THAT PROBE

46tc020i LAST YEAR THE FIRM IS SAID TO HAVE EARNED MORE THAN SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS
46tc020j A CONVENTION WOULD OPEN THE DOOR TO A WHOLE NEW GROUP OF LEADERS
46tc020k <NOISE> AN ELECTION TO CHOOSE CONVENTION DELEGATES WOULD BE LIKE A SPECIAL ELECTION TO PICK A NEW CONGRESS
46tc020l UNDER LEGISLATION PASSED BY THE SENATE A CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION WOULD BE MADE UP OF ONE MEMBER ELECTED FROM EACH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT AND TWO AT LARGE FROM EACH STATE
46tc020m NO CURRENT MEMBERS OF CONGRESS COULD PARTICIPATE

46tc0217 VOLUME IS NO DIFFERENT
46tc0218 THE MARKET HASN'T CHANGED CHARACTER
46tc0219 SO FAR FROM A MARKET VIEWPOINT IT DOESN'T LOOK TO BE MUCH OF AN EVENT
46tc021a EVER SINCE HE TOOK OFFICE THREE AND A HALF YEARS AGO MR. GORBACHEV HAS SOUGHT TO INCREASE FOREIGN TRADE'S MEAGER SHARE OF THE SOVIET ECONOMY
46tc021b RATHER THAN SIMPLY IMPORT MORE WESTERN GOODS HE WOULD LIKE TO OBTAIN THE MACHINERY AND KNOW HOW TO ENABLE THE SOVIETS TO MAKE THE GOODS THEMSELVES
46tc021c <NOISE> TO DO SO HE OPENED UP THE ECONOMY TO FOREIGN CAPITAL AND EQUIPMENT BY PERMITTING JOINT VENTURES

46tc0304 THE ISSUE IS SO SENSITIVE HERE SAYS BOND ANALYST DANIEL SCOTTO OF L. F. ROTHSCHILD UNTERBERG AND TOWBIN
46tc0305 WE ARE ALL CONCERNED THAT THE REGULATORS CAN SIT BACK AND WAIT FOR CREDIT TO CARRY THE COMPANY OUT INTO THE HORIZON

46tc030l I. R. E. HAS DOWNSIZED ITS REAL ESTATE I- SYNDICATION BUSINESS AND IS PRIMARILY A SAVINGS AND LOAN HOLDING COMPANY MR. LEVAN SAID
46tc030m EARNINGS IN THE PAST WERE SOMEWHAT ERRATIC QUARTER TO QUARTER BECAUSE THE MAJOR BUSINESS WAS REAL ESTATE SYNDICATION
46tc030n NOW THE S. AND L. HOLDING COMPANY IS THE MAIN BUSINESS WITH DOWN SIZED W- REAL ESTATE SYNDICATION
46tc030o CORE EARNINGS ARE VERY CONSISTENT
46tc030p ANOTHER OPTION WOULD BE GOING PRIVATE IN A LEVERAGED BUY OUT
46tc030q BUT ANALYSTS SAID MANAGEMENT WOULDN'T PREFER SUCH A PLAN BECAUSE IT WOULD MEAN CURTAILING THE COMPANY'S AMBITIOUS STORE EXPANSION PROGRAM
46tc030r IN A LEVERAGED BUY OUT A SMALL GROUP OF INVESTORS ACQUIRES A COMPANY IN A TRANSACTION FINANCED LARGELY WITH BORROWING
46tc030s <NOISE> ULTIMATELY THE DEBT IS PAID WITH FUNDS GENERATED BY THE ACQUIRED COMPANY'S OPERATIONS OR THE SALE OF ITS ASSETS
46tc030t PEOPLE HE POINTS OUT COME TO HIM NOW
46tc030u THEY KNOW JESSE CAN DELIVER
46tc030v THE BOTTOM LINE IS BECOMING IF YOU WANT SOMEBODY TO COMMUNICATE WITH YOUR CHILDREN GET JESSE
46tc030w <NOISE> IF YOU WANT SOMEONE TO STAND WITH YOU AT A FARM AUCTION OR STAND WITH YOU AT A CLOSED FACTORY GATE GET JESSE
46tc030x IT'S A REPUTATION WITH A GROWING CREDIBILITY TO IT
46tc030y A SPOKESMAN FOR CRAY DESCRIBED THE M. I. T. DECISION AS GOOD NEWS
46tc030z <NOISE> ASSUMING THE BIDDING DOES OPEN UP AGAIN IT MEANS THERE'S ROOM FOR TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND NOT CONSIDERATIONS BASED PURELY ON PRICE
46tc0310 THE SPOKESMAN SAID IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE FOR CRAY TO INSTALL AND OPERATE A COMPLETE SUPERCOM:PUTER SYSTEM AT THE PRICES M. I. T. WANTED TO PAY
46tc0311 <NOISE> BUT WHILE NICKEL AND ESPECIALLY COPPER QUOTES HAVE SINCE REBOUNDED ALUMINUM PRICES HAVE CONTINUED TO TUMBLE
46tc0312 <NOISE> IT SEEMS TO BE IN PEOPLE'S INTEREST TO KEEP THE PRICE DOWN RIGHT NOW SAID ONE LONDON EXCHANGE TRADER

46tc031b <NOISE> HOWEVER JOHN MENDELSON CHIEF MARKET ANALYST AT DEAN WITTER REYNOLDS BELIEVES SUCH A SLUMP COULD HAPPEN
46tc031c I THINK YOU WOULD GO BACK TO NORMAL TURNOVER LEVELS IN A BEAR MARKET
46tc031d YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR TO SEE A REAL DULL LOUSY MARKET
46tc031e TURNOVER LEVEL THAT YEAR SIXTEEN POINT FIVE PERCENT
46tc0401 THAT DECISION CAME EASILY
46tc0402 NOW HE'S WORKING AMID THE METAL FOLDING CHAIRS IN HIS TRANSITION OFFICE IN THE AUSTERE CHAMBER OF THE SENATE EDUCATION COMMITTEE
46tc0403 HIS FIRST BUDGET MUST GO TO THE PRINTER TWO DAYS AFTER HE'S INAUGURATED
46tc0404 <NOISE> BUT IT WILL TAKE A LOT OF ACQUISITIONS FOR SPECIALTY *RETAILING* TO HAVE MUCH EFFECT ON SEARS'S BOTTOM LINE
46tc0405 SEARS'S MERCHANDISE GROUP ALONE GENERATED PROFIT OF SEVEN HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE
46tc0406 INDEED ANALYSTS SAY THAT IN THE PAST SEARS MAY HAVE BEEN HESITANT TO BUY SPECIALTY STORES BECAUSE THEY WOULDN'T QUICKLY CONTRIBUTE TO PROFIT

46tc040l THE COMPANY DIDN'T ANNOUNCE THE VOTES OF THE APRIL THIRTY PROXY VOTE
46tc040m NOT LONG AGO TENNECO WAS CONSIDERED AN UNLIKELY RESTRUCTURING CANDIDATE
46tc040n ITS HEAVY DEBTS AND DEPRESSED ENERGY AND FARM EQUIPMENT BUSINESSES MADE IT APPEAR IMMUNE TO RAIDERS
46tc040o <NOISE> BUT THE COMPANY'S IMPROVING BUSINESS PROSPECTS AND ASSET VALUES HAVE CHANGED THAT
46tc040p T. P. A. REDUCED THE NUMBER OF PATIENT DEATHS BY FIFTY ONE PERCENT IN THE FIRST TWO WEEKS AFTER HEART ATTACK
46tc040q <NOISE> OF THE THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY PATIENTS WHO WERE GIVEN T. P. A. TWO POINT EIGHT PERCENT DIED IN THAT PERIOD

46tc0415 FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS THE KURDS HAVE STRUGGLED TO ESTABLISH AN INDEPENDENT KURDISTAN IN A TERRITORY THAT STRADDLES PARTS OF TURKEY IRAQ AND IRAN
46tc0416 LIKE THE PALESTINIANS THE WORLD'S TWENTY MILLION KURDS SHARE IN A RELIGION A CULTURE A LANGUAGE <NOISE> AND IN A PASSION FOR AUTONOMY
46tc0417 NEARLY HALF LIVE IN TURKEY WHICH REFUSES EVEN TO RECOGNIZE THEM AS A DISTINCT NATIONAL MINORITY <NOISE> AND REFERS TO THEM ONLY AS MOUNTAIN TURKS
46tc0418 THOUGH THE KURDS OUTNUMBER THE PALESTINIANS BY A RATIO OF FIVE TO ONE THE KURDISH CAUSE HAS ATTRACTED LITTLE GLOBAL ATTENTION
46tc0419 <NOISE> THE RESULTS HAVE BEEN IMPRESSIVE
46tc041a ANNUAL GROWTH OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS HAS BEEN MORE THAN FIVE PERCENT AND GROWTH IS EXPECTED TO EXCEED SIX PERCENT THIS YEAR
46tc041b MR. BUCHI BELIEVES SUCH GROWTH CAN BE SUSTAINED
46tc041c SOUTH AFRICA ANGOLA AND CUBA ENDED A ROUND OF PEACE TALKS WITHOUT AN AGREEMENT OR A DATE TO MEET AGAIN
46tc041d BUT SOURCES SAID THE DISCUSSIONS WHICH INVOLVE NAMIBIAN INDEPENDENCE AND PEACE IN ANGOLA HAVE MADE PROGRESS

46uc0205 ITS SAFETY DIRECTOR ALSO SPENT SEVERAL MONTHS VISITING DEALERS AND PROMOTING THE DEVICE
46uc0206 THE FORD SPOKESMAN SAID THIS LATEST INCENTIVE PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO INCREASE CUSTOMERS' PERCEIVED VALUE OF THE AIR BAGS
46uc0207 U. S. BANKS IN JAPAN CURRENTLY CAN TRADE IN SOME SECURITIES BUT ARE BASICALLY CONFINED TO DEALING WITH THE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY LARGEST JAPANESE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
46uc0208 THEY CAN'T DEAL WITH EITHER RETAIL CUSTOMERS OR CORPORATIONS
46uc0209 THEY CAN UNDERWRITE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT BONDS BUT THE SHARE OF SUCH BUSINESS REMAINS VERY SMALL
46uc020a THOUGH THERE ISN'T A CURE FOR AIDS PROPONENTS ARGUE THAT THOSE WHO TEST POSITIVE CAN BE OFFERED TREATMENTS TO PROLONG THEIR LIVES
46uc020b FOR INSTANCE THEY CAN TAKE MEDICATION TO PREVENT CATCHING THE KIND OF PNEUMONIA THAT MOST COMMONLY LEADS TO THE DEATH OF AIDS SUFFERERS

46uc020d BAD MANAGEMENT MAY BE COMMON ENOUGH IN AMERICAN BUSINESS BUT THE RISKS PRESENTED BY BADLY RUN NUCLEAR PLANTS ARE FRIGHTENING

46uc020f INDEED THE AGENCY RECENTLY HAS BEGUN TO CLOSE PLANTS BECAUSE OF MANAGEMENT NOT JUST MECHANICAL SHORTCOMINGS

46uc020o IT ISN'T KNOWN WHETHER SUCH SIDE EFFECTS CAN BE REVERSED DOCTOR SOO SAID
46uc020p WHILE AIDS ALSO CAUSES SOME NEUROPATHY INCLUDING BOTH DISCOMFORT AND WEAKNESS IN THE HANDS AND FEET THE DRUG'S WORST SIDE EFFECT IS THE FOOT PAIN
46uc020q DESPITE ALL THIS THE NEW S. E. C. CHAIRMAN SAYS HE CAN HANDLE THE CHALLENGES FACING THE AGENCY
46uc020r THEY COULDN'T HAVE A BETTER PERSON ON THE JOB AT THIS TIME MR. RUDER SAYS
46uc020s I COME WITH NO BAGGAGE WITH NO PRECONCEIVED IDEAS ABOUT THE BEST REGULATORY METHOD OR THE BEST WAY THE MARKET SHOULD OPERATE
46uc020t I COME WITH VERY STRONG *CONCEPTUAL* SKILLS WITH VERY STRONG HISTORICAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION TO THE REGULATION OF THE SECURITIES MARKETS

46uc020v NINE MONTH NET A YEAR AGO INCLUDED FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS OF SPECIAL ITEMS

46uc020x ALL SEVEN REGIONAL BELLS HAVE VOWED TO APPEAL THE DECEMBER THIRD RULING BY JUDGE HAROLD GREENE THAT FORBIDS THEM TO DESIGN FABRICATE OR ASSEMBLE TELECOMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS AND EQUIPMENT
46uc020y OF COURSE IF THE APPEAL FAILS MANY VENTURES COULD BE JEOPARDIZED OR SCRATCHED
46uc020z BUT IF IT SUCCEEDS COMPANIES THAT HAVEN'T DISMANTLED OR SCALED BACK THEIR RESEARCH EFFORTS COULD SUDDENLY BE AHEAD OF THE COMPETITION
46uc0210 BUT EXXON CORPORATION AMOCO CORPORATION AND ATLANTIC RICHFIELD COMPANY POSTED HIGHER PROFIT
46uc0211 NEW YORK BASED EXXON THE NATION'S BIGGEST OIL COMPANY HAD THE SMALLEST PERCENTAGE INCREASE
46uc0212 ITS NET INCOME CLIMBED FIVE POINT ONE PERCENT EVEN THOUGH GAINS FROM ASSET SALES CONTRIBUTED THIRTY FOUR CENTS A SHARE TO YEAR EARLIER PROFIT
46uc0213 WHILE CAMPBELL IS CONFIDENT ITS MICROWAVE BREAKTHROUGH WILL LURE NEW CUSTOMERS WHO HAVE NEVER BEFORE SAMPLED A FROZEN BREAKFAST OTHER COMPETITORS ARE WAFFLING
46uc0214 WE HAVE LOOKED AT THEM MICROWAVE WAFFLES SAID A SPOKESMAN AT I. C. INDUSTRIES
46uc0215 BUT OUR FEELING IS THAT THE TOASTER WAFFLES THAT YOU CAN PRODUCE IN THIRTY SECONDS ARE MORE CONVENIENT AND BETTER QUALITY
46uc0216 A LORIMAR SPOKESMAN CONFIRMED YESTERDAY THAT MR. ADELSON AGREED TO BUY ABOUT TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE THOUSAND SHARES OF LORIMAR STOCK FROM MR. GARIN
46uc0217 THE SPOKESMAN SAID THE TRANSACTION BETWEEN MESSRS.

46uc0219 THE SENATE PLAN WOULD PROVIDE THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE NATIONAL GUARD TO HELP THE CUSTOMS SERVICE WITH DRUG INSPECTIONS AT U. S. BORDERS
46uc021a BUT ADDITIONAL USE OF MILITARY RADAR PLANES EXPANDED NAVAL PATROLS AND MORE FREQUENT AIRCRAFT INTERCEPTIONS COULD DRAIN THE MILITARY'S ALREADY TIGHT OPERATING BUDGETS
46uc021b <NOISE> THE MEASURE DOESN'T PROVIDE ANY SPECIAL FUNDS FOR THESE OPERATIONS
46uc021c STEPHEN A. DUZAN CHAIRMAN PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER SAID IT'S OBVIOUSLY QUITE A CHANGE FROM A YEAR AGO
46uc021d IT'S OUR THIRD YEAR OF CASH FLOW AND WE'VE BEEN PROFITABLE FOR THREE OUT OF THE LAST FOUR QUARTERS
46uc021e SO WE THINK IN GENERAL THAT THIS REPRESENTS A REAL HEALTHY KIND OF PICTURE FOR A COMPANY WHOSE PRODUCTS AREN'T YET APPROVED
46uc021f THE COMPANY CURRENTLY HAS FOUR OF ITS EXPERIMENTAL PRODUCTS IN HUMAN CLINICAL TRIALS FOR DISEASES SUCH AS CANCER AND ACQUIRED IMMUNE DEFICIENCY SYNDROME
46uc0301 AS EXPECTED THE BUDGET WILL INCLUDE A NUMBER OF PROPOSALS THAT WERE UNSUCCESSFUL LAST YEAR INCLUDING THE SALE OF THE NAVAL PETROLEUM RESERVE AND THE BONNEVILLE POWER ADMINISTRATION
46uc0302 SOME ADMINISTRATION AND CONGRESSIONAL AIDES THINK CONGRESS WILL GO ALONG WITH SELLING THE PETROLEUM RESERVE THIS YEAR
46uc0303 BUT RESISTANCE TO THE BONNEVILLE IDEA WAS SO STRONG THAT LAWMAKERS PASSED A RESOLUTION PROHIBITING THE ADMINISTRATION FROM SPENDING ANY FEDERAL MONEY TO STUDY IT
46uc0304 WHAT EVER GENCORP DOES IT'S GOT TO BE A MASTERPIECE A VAN GOGH
46uc0305 IF THEY DO THE WRONG THING THEY'LL END UP IN PLAY AGAIN SAYS RICHARD L. HAYDON MANAGING DIRECTOR OF BREAN MURRAY FOSTER SECURITIES
46uc0306 HE'D PREFER A DISTRIBUTION OF NINETY DOLLARS CASH PLUS TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS OF SUBORDINATED DEBT AS WELL AS SOME CONTINUING EQUITY FOR CURRENT HOLDERS
46uc0307 THE POLITICAL REASONS FOR CHAIRMAN KENNEDY'S SINGLE MINDEDNESS ARE CLEAR ENOUGH
46uc0308 ORGANIZED LABOR A MAJOR DEMOCRATIC CONSTITUENCY HAS FALLEN ON HARD TIMES AS REFLECTED IN A DECLINE IN THE UNIONIZED SHARE OF THE U. S. WORK FORCE
46uc0309 DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS WANT TO USE POLITICAL MUSCLE TO GIVE LABOR THINGS IT NOW HAS DIFFICULTY WINNING AT THE BARGAINING TABLE
46uc030a CONGRESS GETS CREDIT FOR DOING SOMETHING NICE FOR LABOR AND EMPLOYERS FOOT THE BILL

46uc030o FIRST INTERSTATE'S FOURTH QUARTER LOSS RESULTED FROM A PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION DOLLAR ADDITION TO ITS RESERVES AGAINST POSSIBLE FOREIGN DEBT LOSSES
46uc030p BUT EVEN WITHOUT THE RESERVES THE COMPANY SAID EARNINGS WOULD HAVE BEEN FLAT AT ABOUT EIGHTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS COMPARED WITH THE YEAR EARLIER QUARTER

46wc020g MORE THAN TWENTY FOUR PERCENT WANT IT SCRAPPED COMPLETELY WHILE ANOTHER THIRTY FOUR PERCENT WANT EACH LOCAL COMMUNITY TO PROPERTY OWNER TO DECIDE WHO CAN RENT OR BUY HOUSING
46wc020h ON THE BIG BOARD VOLUME ROSE TO TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY POINT FIVE MILLION SHARES FROM A HUNDRED AND SIXTY EIGHT POINT SIX MILLION THURSDAY
46wc020i BUT THE ACTIVITY WAS LESS THAN ON PREVIOUS TRIPLE WITCHING DAYS AND MUCH OF THE TRADING WAS PACKED INTO THE OPENING AND CLOSING MINUTES OF THE SESSION
46wc020j MORE THAN THIRTY ONE MILLION SHARES CHANGED HANDS IN THE FINAL MINUTE
46wc020k THE PEOPLE WHO ATTENDED THE EVENTS LOVED THEM
46wc020l THE CITIZENS OF THE NEW YORK METROPOLITAN AREA ARE STILL TALKING ABOUT WHAT A TERRIFIC FEELING THE WEEKEND ENGENDERED IN EVERYONE
46wc020m THE STATE OF NEW YORK WAS SO HAPPY THAT <NOISE> USING A PHOTO FROM THE LIBERTY WEEKEND IN ADVERTISEMENTS TO ATTRACT BUSINESS TO THE STATE
46wc020n THOSE WHO WATCHED THE EVENTS ON TELEVISION MORE THAN A HUNDRED MILLION AMERICANS LOVED THEM

46wc020p THE FRENCH WERE SO IMPRESSED BY THE CELEBRATION THEY THANKED THE U. S. IN AN AD IN A NEW YORK NEWSPAPER
46wc020q IN THE END THERE IS LITTLE THE U. S. CAN DO TO CONTROL EVENTS IN SOUTH AFRICA
46wc020r <NOISE> THE ADMINISTRATION'S SIX YEAR CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT POLICY DESIGNED TO COAX PRETORIA TOWARD DISMANTLING APARTHEID DIDN'T SUCCEED
46wc020s <NOISE> AND SANCTIONS IN THE SHORT RUN WON'T DAMAGE SOUTH AFRICA'S SELF RELIANT ECONOMY
46wc020t BUT THE PERCEPTION OF INACTION HAS DIPLOMATIC COSTS FOR THE U. S. AND SO FOR THE TIME BEING SANCTIONS SEEM TO BE THE BEST BET
46wc020u THE NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO A. B. M. TREATY REQUIRES A REVIEW EVERY FIVE YEARS

46wc020w THE THIRD REVIEW WAS DUE BY OCTOBER THIRD NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
46wc020x THE MOST OPTIMISTIC ESTIMATES ARE NOW THAT IT WILL START SOMETIME AFTER THE FIRST OF THE YEAR
46wc020y THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION IN SHORT IS CONSPIRING WITH THE SOVIETS TO VIOLATE THE REVIEW PROVISIONS OF THE TREATY
46wc020z IT IS SAD BUT TRUE THAT INTERNATIONAL SPORTING EXTRAVAGANZAS HAVE COME TO BE CONDUCTED AMID THE SORT OF SECURITY OTHERWISE RESERVED <NOISE> FOR THE TRAVELS OF HEADS OF STATE
46wc0210 THE SWISS HOCKEY COACH WAS QUOTED AS SAYING THAT HIS PLAYERS WERE SURPRISED THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO SHOW THEIR PASSES AT THE BLUE LINE WHEN THEY BACK CHECKED

46wc0212 ANYONE WHO ACCEPTS THE JOB OF INVESTIGATING THE SPEAKER SHOULD BE PREPARED TO TAKE SOME HEAT
46wc0213 LAST WEEK COMMON CAUSE CALLED FOR AN INVESTIGATION OF MR. WRIGHT'S FINANCES
46wc0214 THE SPEAKER RETALIATED IN A PUBLIC STATEMENT AND HIS MINIONS IN THE LEADERSHIP SAID THE GROUP WAS DEAD ON CAPITOL HILL
46wc0215 THIS WAS ROUGH ON ALL DEBTORS DOMESTIC AS WELL AS INTERNATIONAL
46wc0216 <NOISE> BUT NO ONE PROPOSED SOLUTIONS FOR DOMESTIC DEBTORS AS GRAND AS THOSE OFFICIALLY OFFERED FOR THIRD WORLD DEBTORS
46wc0217 THE FIRST PART OF THE OFFICIAL PROPOSAL WAS TO REDUCE THE INTEREST BURDEN OF THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
46wc0218 <NOISE> SECOND PROMOTE WORLD ECONOMIC RECOVERY
46wc0219 <NOISE> THIRD NEW LOANS SHOULD BE MADE TO THE DEBTOR NATIONS BY THE BANKS THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND THE WORLD BANK AND EXPORT CREDIT AGENCIES

46wc021d THESE PROBLEMS OF THE RECENT PAST PALE IN SCOPE NEXT TO THE PERVASIVENESS AND THE TOTAL DOLLARS INVOLVED IN THE CURRENT CRAZE
46wc021e IF THE PARTICIPANTS IN THIS CRAZE AWAKEN NOW THE CORRECTION MAY STILL BE WITHIN TOLERABLE LIMITS FOR THE COUNTRY
46wc021f IF NOT ALL OF AMERICA WILL PAY THE PENALTY BECAUSE THE DEBT IS HUGE AND WIDELY HELD AND THE BANKING STRUCTURE'S INTEGRITY WOULD BE AT STAKE

46wc0306 THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE COMPULSIVE BUILDERS HE SAYS
46wc0307 THEY LIKE ACQUIRING COMPANIES MAKING PROFITS GO UP AND RECRUITING PEOPLE
46wc0308 FIRING ISN'T WHAT THEY'RE EMOTIONALLY GEARED FOR
46wc0309 THEY FIND IT REPUGNANT
46wc030a DEFENDERS OF THE FOOTNOTE ARGUE THAT IT MAKES SENSE AS TAX POLICY
46wc030b WHY THEY ASK SHOULD WEALTHY BEST SELLING AUTHORS GET SUBSTANTIAL TAX DEFERRALS WHILE MOM AND POP MANUFACTURERS FOR EXAMPLE CAN'T
46wc030c <NOISE> AS A RULE OF TAXES IT'S A GOOD RULE BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT PEOPLE TAKING DEDUCTIONS BEFORE THEY CAN GET THE INCOME SAYS ONE CONGRESSIONAL AIDE
46wc030d IT'S THE TIME VALUE OF MONEY PRINCIPLE

46wc030g WESTERN UNION HAS SAID THAT <NOISE> PLANS ARE DEFEATED IT WILL FILE FOR REORGANIZATION UNDER CHAPTER ELEVEN OF THE FEDERAL BANKRUPTCY LAWS
46wc030h THE CONFRONTATION IN FEDERAL COURT MAY BREAK NEW GROUND IN BANKRUPTCY LAW
46wc030i OTHER COURTS NOTABLY THE ONE IN CHARGE OF THE MANVILLE CORPORATION CHAPTER ELEVEN PROCEEDINGS HAVE SET UP TRUST FUNDS TO PAY LARGE CLASSES OF INJURY VICTIMS

46wc030v WHEN COMMODITY PRICES SOAR PEOPLE PULL OUT <NOISE> OFTEN WITH THEIR MOBILE HOMES TRAILING BEHIND
46wc030w AND REVENUES SLUMP
46wc030x BUT MR. PETERSON SAYS THERE STILL IS AN IMAGE PROBLEM
46wc030y IF WE HAVEN'T WORKED WITH A COMPANY BEFORE THE NATURAL REACTION IS WHY THE HELL ARE YOU BRINGING IN ACCOUNTANTS TO WORK IN THE PLANT
46wc030z YET WE PROBABLY HAVE THE LARGEST MANUFACTURING CONSULTING PRACTICE IN THE WORLD
46wc0310 HOPING TO PREVENT LONG COSTLY DISPUTES OVER WHAT DOCUMENTS DEFENDANTS HAVE TO SURRENDER JUDGES GRANT BLANKET PROTECTIVE ORDERS

46wc031a HE WOULD HAVE INCURRED THE WRATH OF THE RIGHT TO LIFE MOVEMENT AND I WOULD HAVE BEEN THE ENEMY MR. FULTON SAYS
46wc0401 BUT TEXAS AMERICAN MAY HAVE ITS PROBLEMS WITH THE PROPOSED COMBINATION OF REPUBLICBANK AND INTERFIRST
46wc0402 BY VIRTUE OF THEIR SIZE ALONE THEY WILL BE DOMINANT IN THE STATE MR. GRANT ADDED

46wc040p IN A STATEMENT NYMEX EFFECTIVELY TOLD COMEX TO BACK OFF
46wc040q AND IT SUGGESTED THAT COMEX IS TO BLAME FOR THE DELAY SPECIFICALLY THE FACT THAT MR. BRODY NEXT MONTH WILL RELINQUISH HIS CHAIRMANSHIP TO AN EXCHANGE MEMBER
46wc040r MR. BRODY WILL REMAIN PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE
46wc040s A FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT AND AN APPEALS COURT BOTH IN RICHMOND UPHELD THE PLAN
46wc040t BUT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX THE SUPREME COURT TOLD THE APPEALS COURT TO RECONSIDER ITS POSITION IN LIGHT OF ANOTHER HIGH COURT RULING
46wc040u LAST JULY THE APPEALS COURT STRUCK DOWN THE PLAN RULING THAT AFFIRMATIVE ACTION MUST BE BASED ON EVIDENCE THAT THE CITY ITSELF HAD DISCRIMINATED IN THE PAST

46xc040v STANFORD NOW CHOOSES NOT TO REQUIRE ITS UNDERGRADUATES TO STUDY THEIR WESTERN HERITAGE BUT THAT HISTORY DOES YIELD CERTAIN LESSONS
46xc040w ONE OF THEM IS THAT MINORITIES THAT DO NOT RESPOND EFFECTIVELY TO ATTACKS FROM THE MAJORITY MERELY ENCOURAGE FURTHER ASSAULTS

46xc041f DELAWARE CURRENTLY ALLOWS SOME SECURITIES UNDERWRITING BY STATE CHARTERED BANKS MS. SHAW NOTES AND NEW YORK HAS DEBATED A SIMILAR MOVE
46yc0201 THE TRASH
46yc0202 PROOFS OF PURCHASE AND SALES RECEIPTS THAT HAD BEEN TURNED IN FOR CONSUMER PRODUCT REBATES AND ALREADY PAID
46yc0203 THE WOMEN RESUBMITTED THOUSANDS OF THE REBATES AND CAMOUFLAGED THEIR TRAIL BY VARYING THEIR NAMES AND USING POSTAL BOXES ALL OVER THE COUNTRY
46yc0204 FOR KODAK A FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR PENALTY WOULD REPRESENT ABOUT A DOLLAR FIFTY A SHARE AFTER TAXES
46yc0205 IT MIGHT BE SEEN AS A VICTORY FOR KODAK SAYS ALEX

46yc020g SOME BANKERS HAVE ESTIMATED THAT THE TOTAL MAY RISE AS HIGH AS TEN BILLION DOLLARS THIS YEAR
46yc020h SUCH SWAPS ONLY BEGAN ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO
46yc020i ALBERT GROSS CHIEF ECONOMIST AT REFCO INC. AGREED
46yc020j THE BOND MARKET WAS HELPED TEMPORARILY BY A DECLINE IN GOLD AND OTHER COMMODITY PRICES A STRENGTHENING DOLLAR AND A STOCK MARKET RALLY HE SAID
46yc020k BUT I EXPECT THE DOLLAR TO CONTINUE FALLING AND THAT WILL ACCELERATE INFLATION PRESSURES
46yc020l THE BEST NUMBERS ON INFLATION ARE BEHIND US
46yc020m MOST OF THE DAMAGE TO STOCK PRICES CAME IN THE LATE AFTERNOON AS BOND PRICES SAGGED ADDING FUEL TO THE FIRE OF INTEREST RATE FEARS
46yc020n BONDS IN TURN SEEMED TO BE REACTING TO A DECLINE IN THE DOLLAR OFF ITS HIGHS EARLY IN THE DAY
46yc020o THE DOLLAR NEVERTHELESS SHOWED A GAIN FOR THE DAY AGAINST BOTH THE YEN AND THE WEST GERMAN MARK

46yc020s MR. REAGAN'S COMMENTS DON'T REFLECT ANY CHANGE IN HIS INTERPRETATION OF THE DEFICIT REDUCTION AGREEMENT
46yc020t AT THE INSISTENCE OF THE WHITE HOUSE THE PLAN SPECIFICALLY NOTED THAT THE PRESIDENT COULD EITHER SIGN OR VETO THE SPECIFIC TAXES CONGRESS CHOOSES
46yc020u AND THE ADMINISTRATION HAS SAID BEFORE THAT IT ISN'T HAPPY WITH THE PROVISION ON TAKEOVERS
46yc020v HOWEVER SUCH AN AGREEMENT MAY YET OCCUR
46yc020w THERE'S A LOT BREWING HERE SAID ONE SOURCE CLOSE TO APPLE
46yc020x THIS IS ONLY THE FIRST OF SEVERAL RELATED ANNOUNCEMENTS AND UNDERTAKINGS
46yc020y THE SOURCE SAID TECHNICAL AGREEMENTS ARE EASIER TO HAMMER OUT THAN MARKETING AGREEMENTS
46yc020z MOBIL BASED IN NEW YORK SAID ITS FOURTH QUARTER NET INCOME JUMPED NINETY TWO PERCENT
46yc0210 THE LATEST QUARTER INCLUDED A ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION DOLLAR WRITE DOWN OF FOREIGN INVENTORIES
46yc0211 REVENUE ROSE TWENTY FIVE PERCENT TO FIFTEEN POINT SIXTY SIX BILLION DOLLARS FROM TWELVE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS
46yc0212 IN RECENT MONTHS THE QUOTA PROGRAM ITSELF HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY CONTROVERSIAL
46yc0213 SOME BIG U. S. STEELMAKERS WHICH SELL SEMIFINISHED STEEL TO THE DOMESTIC MARKETPLACE ARE FIGHTING TO CONTINUE QUOTAS AFTER THEIR SCHEDULED EXPIRATION SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH
46yc0214 OTHERS THOUGH DEPENDENT ON OUTSIDE SUPPLIES OF SEMIFINISHED ARE PUSHING TO END QUOTAS
46yc0215 THE SINGAPORE GOVERNMENT INVITES FOREIGN NEWSPAPERS TO PRINT THE TRUTH ABOUT SINGAPORE
46yc0216 BUT WHY HAS THE ASIAN WALL STREET JOURNAL REFUSED TO PRINT GOVERNMENT REPLIES CORRECTING ERRORS AND BIASES IN ITS REPORTING
46yc0217 WHY DOES IT DENY THE SINGAPORE GOVERNMENT THE SIMPLE RIGHT TO REPLY
46yc0218 ONE BIG PLAY LAST YEAR WAS LEISURE
46yc0219 ANOTHER WAS UNDERVALUED ASSETS EVEN THOUGH NO ONE CAN RECALL A JAPANESE COMPANY BEING BROKEN UP FOR ITS ASSETS
46yc021a ONCE YOU GET THAT THEME THE LEVEL OF THE P. E. RATIO DOESN'T MEAN A DAMN SAYS MR. ROBINS
46yc021b IT'S ALL A BIT OF A MIRAGE
46yc021c YET ONE THAT SO FAR HAS WORKED
46yc021d NINE MONTH RESULTS ALSO INCLUDE A TWELVE MILLION DOLLAR NET LOSS FROM THE DISPOSITION OF TRUCKING OPERATIONS
46yc021e ABOUT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS OF THE TRUCKING CHARGE WAS TAKEN IN THE THIRD QUARTER
46yc021f YEAR EARLIER RESULTS WERE RESTATED FOR ACCOUNTING CHANGES
46yc0301 WHEN MRS. HIGA TOOK OVER THE BUSINESS IN NINETEEN SIXTY SIX FROZEN PIZZA WAS STILL A LONG SHOT
46yc0302 THE AVERAGE JAPANESE DIDN'T HAVE FREEZER SPACE LET ALONE AN OVEN
46yc0303 AND THE MOST COMMON RESPONSE TO SUPERMARKET TASTE TESTS WAS THAT CHEESE LOOKED AND TASTED LIKE SOAP SHE RECALLS
46yc0304 BUT SHE KEPT GOING PEDDLING HER PIZZAS TO RESTAURANTS AND FANCY HOTELS
46yc0305 SMOKERS ARE FEELING THE HEAT BECAUSE COMPANIES ARE TAKING A HARDER LINE ON SUCH ISSUES AS PRODUCTIVITY RISING MEDICAL COSTS AND THE EFFECTS OF PASSIVE SMOKE
46yc0306 ALTHOUGH THERE ARE CONFLICTING CLAIMS ABOUT WHETHER SMOKERS COST EMPLOYERS MORE IN TERMS OF HIGHER INSURANCE RATES AND ABSENTEEISM COMPANIES OFTEN CITE SUCH CONCERNS TO JUSTIFY RESTRICTIVE SMOKING POLICIES
46yc0307 IN ADDITION NEW STATE AND LOCAL ORDINANCES AND EMPLOYEE COMPLAINTS PUT SIGNIFICANT PRESSURE ON MANY COMPANIES
46yc0308 THE GOVERNMENT CIVIL SUIT ALLEGED THAT A DEFECT COULD CAUSE THE REAR BRAKES TO LOCK SENDING THE CAR SPINNING OUT OF CONTROL
46yc0309 G. M. WHICH NO LONGER MAKES X. CARS DENIED THAT THE BRAKES ARE DEFECTIVE
46yc030a AGREEING WITH G. M. JUDGE JACKSON RULED THAT THE GOVERNMENT CAME TO COURT WITH NOTHING MORE ESSENTIALLY THAN A REASONABLE SUSPICION THAT A DEFECT EXISTED
46yc030b THE SUIT WHICH ALSO NAMES THE COMPANY'S DIRECTORS AS DEFENDANTS SAYS THE DIRECTORS HAVE GIVEN PERSONAL GAIN A PRIORITY OVER THE INTERESTS OF PUBLIC SHAREHOLDERS
46yc030c A SECOND SUIT BY MOSHE J. SCHWARTZ JEFFREY ABRAMS STANLEY HEINEMAN AND JAMES T. CAIN CONTAINS COMPARABLE CHARGES
46yc030d EARLIER AT LEAST TWO OF THOSE SAME PLAINTIFFS FILED A SUIT OVER THE ANTAR STOCK SALES
46yc030e A LOSS WASN'T EXPECTED GIVEN CONTINENTAL'S OPERATIONAL DIFFICULTIES THAT DEVELOPED IN THE QUARTER
46yc030f HOWEVER THE RESULTS OF TEXAS AIR'S SUBSIDIARIES ARE THE REVERSE OF WHAT MANY ANALYSTS HAD PREDICTED EARLIER IN THE YEAR
46yc030g INSTEAD OF A MODEST PROFIT AT LOW COST CONTINENTAL BY THE SECOND QUARTER THE NEWLY EXPANDED UNIT HAS STRUGGLED WITH LOSSES
46yc030h ITS HIGHER COST SISTER EASTERN AIRLINES HAS SHOWN SIGNS OF FINANCIAL PROGRESS DESPITE CONTINUING CONFRONTATIONS WITH ITS EMPLOYEE UNIONS
46yc030i MR. LAY SAID THE LOSSES OCCURED IN LATE SEPTEMBER AND EARLY THIS MONTH <NOISE> A TIME OF PARTICULAR VOLATILITY IN OIL MARKETS
46yc030j THERE WERE TWO SENIOR PEOPLE COLLUDING AND KEEPING A SEPARATE SET OF BOOKS APART FROM THE OFFICIAL BOOKS FOR A FEW WEEKS MR. LAY SAID
46yc030k THEIR GUESSES WERE WRONG ON BOTH SIDES OF THE MARKET
46yc030l AN F. T. C. SPOKESMAN DECLINED TO COMMENT
46yc030m THE INVESTIGATION WAS FIRST REPORTED IN F. T. C. WATCH A PUBLICATION ABOUT REGULATORY MATTERS
46yc030n REACHED IN NEW YORK LAST NIGHT MR. TRUMP CONFIRMED THAT THE F. T. C. HAD MADE THE REQUEST
46yc030o HE DECLINED TO ELABORATE
46yc030p SEPARATELY WALL STREET SPECULATION GREW THAT MEDIA INVESTOR RUPERT MURDOCH WAS CONSIDERING ACQUIRING A STAKE IN LONDON BASED W. P. P.
46yc030q A MURDOCH AIDE SAID THAT MR. MURDOCH HAS BEEN LOOKING FOR A LONG TIME AT THE COMPANY
46yc030r BUT A W. P. P. SPOKESMAN SAID THAT THERE HAS BEEN NO CONTACT AND THERE HAS BEEN NO ACQUISITION OF W. P. P. SHARES BY MURDOCH
46yc030s YESTERDAY PEOPLE CLOSE TO FEDERATED'S BOARD SAID THAT THE COMPANY WAS STILL OPEN TO YET ANOTHER FRIENDLY MERGER PROPOSAL FROM CAMPEAU
46yc030t IF THEY'VE GOT SOMETHING TO SHOW US WE'LL TAKE A LOOK AT IT
46yc030u THEY KNOW WHERE TO FIND US SAID ONE SOURCE
46yc030v WE'RE NOT STONEWALLING THEM
46yc030w I CAN'T GUARANTEE OUR GROUP IS ONE HUNDRED PERCENT SOLID SAID AN OFFICIAL AT SUEZ A FRENCH HOLDING COMPANY
46yc030x I CAN'T TELL YOU THAT AT THOSE PRICES THERE WON'T BE ANY RENEGING ON AGREEMENTS SIGNED BY THE CONSORTIUM'S MEMBERS
46yc030y BUT HE ADDED SUCH ACTION COULD LEAD TO LEGAL REPRISALS
46yc030z BOTH SIDES HAVE WORKED HARD AND SOME PROGRESS HAS BEEN REALIZED IN A NUMBER OF AREAS S:AID MESSRS.
46yc0310 SHULTZ AND SHEVARDNADZE IN A JOINT STATEMENT LAST NIGHT
46yc0311 BUT MUCH MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE
46yc0312 THE UNITED NATIONS WHOSE GARBAGE BILL IS FORTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH IS SERVED BY NATIONAL CARTING COMPANY WHICH WON THE PICKUP RIGHTS EIGHT YEARS AGO
46yc0313 LAST DECEMBER THE U. N. DIDN'T ATTEMPT TO SOLICIT BIDS
46yc0314 IT SIMPLY EXTENDED ITS CONTRACT WITH NATIONAL CARTING
46yc0315 SOLICITING BIDS IN THIS PARTICULAR INDUSTRY IS NOT THE WAY TO GO A U. N. SPOKESMAN SAYS IMPLYING THAT IT IS FUTILE
46yc0316 BUT CRITICS CHARGED THAT THE COLLAR ACTUALLY ADDED TO VOLATILITY BY MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR INDEX ARBITRAGERS TO DO THEIR BUSINESS
46yc0317 MANY TRADERS ARGUE THAT SUCH ARBITRAGE HAS THE EFFECT OF SMOOTHING OUT VOLATILITY IN THE MARKETS
46yc0318 INDEX ARBITRAGERS BUY AND SELL LARGE AMOUNTS OF STOCKS AND STOCK INDEX FUTURES TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF BRIEF PRICE DISPARITIES BETWEEN THE TWO RELATED INSTRUMENTS
46yc0319 THE SCENE THE ANNUAL NORMAN MAILER COCKTAIL PARTY AND FIST FIGHT
46yc031a CANDICE BERGEN AND WOODY ALLEN HAD JUST JOINED A GROUP OF PSEUDO INTELLECTUALS AND WERE RAMBLING WITH THE BEST OF THEM
46yc031b I OFTEN THINK OBSERVED MS. BERGEN THAT IF DOSTOEVSKI HAD BEEN A SINGER HE'D HAVE SOUNDED LIKE RAY CHARLES
46yc031c THE OTHER NON WINNERS MOST NOTABLY EXXON WERE IN MANY WAYS AS NOTEWORTHY AS THE WINNERS <NOISE>
46yc031d IT IS BELIEVED THAT EXXON WAS OUTBID FOR SEVERAL RESERVE PACKAGES LEAVING IT WITH A LOT OF CASH THAT COULD STILL BE EARMARKED FOR ACQUISITIONS
46yc031e AT THE HOUSTON PETROLEUM CLUB INDUSTRY OFFICIALS COULDN'T EAT LUNCH OF LATE WITHOUT DISCUSSING SPECULATION THAT EXXON WAS GOING TO WALK AWAY WITH ALL OF THE TENNECO PROPERTIES
46yc031f AN EXXON SPOKESWOMAN SAID IT WAS COMPANY POLICY NOT TO COMMENT ON ANYTHING TO DO WITH ACQUISITIONS
46yc0401 ALSO SELLING WELL WAS A FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR ISSUE OF REVENUE BONDS BY THE FLORIDA DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES
46yc0402 THE UNSOLD BALANCE WAS ABOUT TEN POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS
46yc0403 THE BONDS WERE PRICED AFTER AUCTION TO YIELD FROM FOUR POINT TWO PERCENT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT TO SEVEN POINT TWO PERCENT IN TWENTY TWELVE
46yc0404 MOODY'S RATED THE BONDS SINGLE A. WHILE S. AND P. RATED THEM SINGLE A. MINUS
46yc0405 GOLDMAN SACHS AND COMPANY WAS THE LEAD UNDERWRITER
46yc0406 STILL HE WOULD HAVE PREFERRED THERE TO BE NO BIDS AT ALL
46yc0407 <NOISE> THE COMPANY'S POLICY FOR EIGHTY FIVE YEARS HAS BEEN TO BE INDEPENDENT AND GROW AND WE HAVE SUCCEEDED HE SAYS
46yc0408 WE ARE EVALUATING THE OFFERS FOR THE COMPANY AND FOR THE SHAREHOLDERS BUT WE PROFOUNDLY REGRET THE SITUATION
46yc0409 SO STRANGE IS THE SITUATION THAT ONE HOLLY DIRECTOR HAS PROPOSED CHANGING THE COMPANY'S NAME TO FANTASY SUGAR COMPANY
46yc040a HE SAYS THAT COULD ENTICE SHAMROCK BECAUSE OF ITS DISNEY CONNECTION TO BUY THE COMPANY
46yc040b JUST THINK OF HOW MUCH THEY COULD MAKE ON THE MOVIE RIGHTS HE ADDS
46yc040c DURING THE PAST SEVERAL DAYS CORPORATIONS AND OTHER BIG INVESTORS HAVE REFRAINED FROM LENDING TREASURY BONDS AND NOTES TO SECURITIES DEALERS FOR BRIEF PERIODS
46yc040d THAT IN TURN HAS FORCED MANY DEALERS TO REFRAIN FROM SELLING BORROWED SECURITIES OR AMASSING SO CALLED SHORT POSITIONS
46yc040e IT'S HARD TO SHORT ANYTHING IN THIS MARKET AT THE MOMENT SAID A TRADER AT A LARGE GOVERNMENT SECURITIES DEALER
46yc040f MR. ANTONIU DENIES ANY WRONGDOING
46yc040g I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO WORRY ABOUT THE FORMER INVESTMENT BANKER SAYS
46yc040h I HAVE ALWAYS FOLLOWED THE ADVICE OF MY LAWYER AND ACCOUNTANTS
46yc040i HE SAYS THAT HE HAS COOPERATED IN AN INQUIRY BY FLORIDA OFFICIALS BUT THAT HE ISN'T AWARE THE MATTER HAS BEEN REFERRED TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE
46yc040j IN ANY CASE HE SAYS SPORT ABOUT'S PROBLEMS WILL BE CURED BY THE PUBLIC OFFERING AND ARE COMMONPLACE IN ANY RAPIDLY GROWING FRANCHISE BUSINESS
46yc040k WHERE CAN WE FIND SOME CLUES TO THE ANSWER OR AT LEAST A POSSIBLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION
46yc040l I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WE LOOK AT THE ONE MARXIST LENINIST STATE THAT ALREADY HAS GONE QUITE FAR DOWN THE REVISIONIST ROAD
46yc040m I REFER TO THE CURIOUSLY NEGLECTED INSTANCE OF YUGOSLAVIA
46yc040n OUTSIDE OF THE CONGRESSIONAL LEADERSHIP PATIENCE IS WEARING THIN ON PORK BARRELING CONTINUING RESOLUTIONS
46yc040o THERE ARE EVEN CONGRESSMEN WHO SAY THEY WANT TO PASS SEPARATE BUDGET BILLS THIS YEAR
46yc040p WE'LL SEE
46yc040q WHAT SEEMS MORE LIKELY IS THAT EITHER A PRESIDENT OR THE COURTS OR BOTH SOMEDAY WILL HAVE TO RESCUE THE VETO BY FORCING CONGRESS TO GIVE UP ITS ARROGANT WAYS
46yc040r <NOISE> SO FAR WE'VE FOUND THAT FEDERAL EMPLOYEES HAVE DEALT WITH THIS ISSUE WITH A GREAT DEAL OF SENSITIVITY AND COMMON SENSE MRS. HORNER SAID
46yc040s BUT THERE'S A NEED FOR CLARITY
46yc040t THESE GUIDELINES WILL SERVE AS REASSURANCE TO OUR MANAGERS
46yc040u SENATOR BENTSEN'S CORPORATE TAX PROPOSAL WOULD REPLACE A PROVISION IN THE COMMITTEE BILL ALLOWING THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE TO WITHHOLD REFUNDS FROM TAXPAYERS WHO HAVE DEFAULTED ON GOVERNMENT LOANS
46yc040v THIS PROVISION WON'T RAISE ANY MONEY IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR AND SENATOR BENTSEN WANTED SOMETHING THAT WOULD ALLOW A QUICKER END TO THE DIESEL TAX COLLECTION
46yc040w THE TEXAS DEMOCRAT PLANS TO OFFER HIS SUBSTITUTION WHEN THE TAX PACKAGE REACHES THE SENATE FLOOR
46yc040x MAKERS WORLD WIDE HAVE BEEN RACING TO DEVELOP COMPACT DISK RECORDERS
46yc040y MANY BIG JAPANESE STEREO MAKERS INCLUDING NAMES LIKE SANYO AND SONY HAVE BEEN WORKING FOR YEARS TO DEVELOP SOMETHING AKIN TO TANDY'S NEW TECHNOLOGY
46yc040z LIKE TANDY'S THOSE MACHINES ARE ABOUT TWO YEARS AWAY ANALYSTS SAY
46yc0410 COMPACT DISK RECORDERS THAT STORE COMPUTER DATA RATHER THAN SOUND ARE EXPECTED OUT THIS YEAR
46yc0411 UNION PACIFIC CORPORATION HAS ROLLED TWO CLUB CARS INTO TOWN TO ENTERTAIN DEMOCRATS
46yc0412 THE COMPANY IS HEADED BY DREW LEWIS FREQUENTLY A TROUBLESHOOTER FOR THE REPUBLICANS
46yc0413 THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS IS THROWING SEVERAL PARTIES AND PROUDLY BOASTS THAT EIGHTY NINE OF ITS MEMBERS ARE DELEGATES OR ALTERNATES TO THIS CONVENTION
46yc0414 DISCUSSION OF THIS SUBJECT BETTER DESCRIBED AS BROODING ABOUT IT IS FILLED WITH MISCONCEPTIONS
46yc0415 ONE OF THESE IS THE GREAT CONCERN WITH THE U. S. HAVING BECOME A NET DEBTOR
46yc0416 WHAT IS MEANT BY THAT IS THAT AMERICANS APPARENTLY OWN FEWER ASSETS ABROAD THAN FOREIGNERS OWN IN THE U. S.
46yc0417 MANY PEOPLE HAVE POINTED OUT THAT THESE CALCULATIONS ARE SPURIOUS BECAUSE THE ASSETS ARE NOT ALL VALUED ON THE SAME BASIS
46yc0418 IF ALL ASSETS WERE VALUED AT TODAY'S PRICES THE NET DEBT OF THE U. S. WOULD CERTAINLY BE MUCH SMALLER THAN IT NOW APPEARS AND MIGHT BE A NET ASSET
46yc0419 INVESTORS TAKING PART IN THE FINANCING WILL LEND VENEZUELA ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN EXCHANGE FOR MONTHLY PAYMENTS FROM THE NEW YORK TRUST FUND
46yc041a THOSE PAYMENTS WILL BE SENT WHEN THE FINANCING IS COMPLETED WHICH IS EXPECTED IN MID DECEMBER
46yc041b THE INTEREST RATE WILL BE BASED ON THE FIVE YEAR U. S. TREASURY BOND RATE PLUS A STILL UNDECIDED INTEREST RATE MARGIN THE VENEZUELAN OFFICIAL SAID
46yc041c INVESTORS CONTINUE TO FLOCK TO THE MORE CONSERVATIVE STOCK PORTFOLIOS
46yc041d GROWTH AND INCOME FUNDS WHICH COMBINE HEFTY DIVIDENDS WITH THE GOAL OF CAPITAL APPRECIATION LEAD ALL OTHER STOCK FUND CATEGORIES IN SALES FOR JUNE
46yc041e AMONG BOND FUNDS LONG TERM MUNICIPAL FUNDS CAPTURED THE TOP SPOT
46zc0201 I'M VERY NERVOUS BECAUSE MY VIEW ON RATES IS SO CLOSE TO THE CONSENSUS EDWARD HYMAN <NOISE> OF CYRUS J. LAWRENCE INCORPORATED SAYS
46zc0202 REMEMBER THE CONSENSUS USUALLY IS WRONG
46zc0203 THE MARKETS SEEM DETERMINED TO MAKE AS MANY ECONOMISTS LOOK AS STUPID AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN
46zc0204 I WAS STARTLED STARTLED ISN'T THE WORD REACTED ALVIN NOVICK A BIOLOGY PROFESSOR AT YALE UNIVERSITY
46zc0205 <NOISE> HE WARNED THAT FORCED TESTING SUCH AS CONTEMPLATED BY THE CENTERS WOULD DRIVE HOMOSEXUALS UNDERGROUND AND AWAY FROM COOPERATION WITH PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAMS
46zc0206 RATIONAL PEOPLE WON'T COOPERATE IN RUINING THEIR OWN LIVES HE SAID
46zc0207 <NOISE> LOCAL NEWSPAPERS YESTERDAY SAID THE GOVERNMENT MAY QUALIFY THE DECISION TO SIGN THE RESTRUCTURING AGREEMENT
46zc0208 BUT OFFICIAL SOURCES SAID THE SIGNING IS LIKELY TO TAKE PLACE DURING THE LAST WEEK IN SEPTEMBER
46zc0209 THE SIGNING DEADLINE IS OCTOBER ONE
46zc020a OTHER TOY MAKERS SUCH AS MATTEL INCORPORATED HAVE BEEN BRINGING OUT NEW PRODUCTS EARLY IN THE YEAR TO INCREASE SALES AT TIMES OTHER THAN CHRISTMAS
46zc020b BUT TYCO'S DAY AFTER CHRISTMAS LAUNCH IS UNUSUAL
46zc020c THE TOY BUSINESS IS RIPE FOR SOME MARKETING INNOVATION AFTER TWO YEARS OF RELATIVELY FLAT SALES SAYS RICK ANGUILLA EDITOR OF THE TOY AND HOBBY WORLD MAGAZINE
46zc020d IF TYCO SUCCEEDS OTHERS WILL CERTAINLY FOLLOW
46zc020e <NOISE> NO ONE SEEMS QUITE SURE HOW THE PUBLISHER JUGGLES HIS ASSETS AMONG HIS VARIOUS COMPANIES WHICH INCLUDE THE PUBLICLY OWNED MAXWELL COMMUNICATION CORPORATION AND VARIOUS PRIVATE ONES

470c040t BUT THAT WOULD HURT THOUSANDS <NOISE> OF AMERICAN WORKERS WHO ARE EMPLOYED EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY BY SUCH COMPANIES
470c040u THE POLITICAL FALLOUT FOR THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION MIGHT BE TOO GREAT A- TO RISK THAT
470c040v IN A STATEMENT NYMEX EFFECTIVELY TOLD COMEX TO BACK OFF

471c020k THE CONTRAS HAVE COMPLAINED ABOUT BEING POORLY CONSULTED ON CENTRAL AMERICAN PEACE EFFORTS
471c020l <NOISE> INVESTORS RANGING FROM U. S. CORPORATIONS TO JAPANESE BUYERS OF U. S. T. BILLS MUST FACTOR IN A RISK PREMIUM FOR DOLLAR VOLATILITY
471c020m THUS IT IS AT LEAST PLAUSIBLE IF NOT LIKELY THAT DOLLAR VOLATILITY IS ONE R- REASON REAL INTEREST RATES HAVE STAYED HIGH IN THE U. S.
471c020n <NOISE> IT IS CERTAINLY TRUE THAT NO PLAN TO RESTORE STABILITY TO WORLD MARKETS CAN SUCCEED WITHOUT ADDRESSING DOLLAR VOLATILITY

471c0216 EVEN AFTER FINDING A BUYER COMPLETING A FORECLOSURE SALE IS HARDLY ROUTINE
471c0217 BROKERS AT MERRILL LYNCH REALTY RECALL A SALE THAT WAS DELAYED FOR A MONTH BY A ONE MILLION DOLLAR INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE LIEN ON THE PROPERTY
471c0218 ANOTHER SALE WAS DELAYED WHEN THE LENDER DISCOVERED THAT THE OWNER HAD DIED BETWEEN THE TIME THE PROPERTY WAS POSTED FOR FORECLOSURE AND THE FORECLOSURE WAS COMPLETED

471c0301 PHIL WATERS WHOSE BACK YARD WOULD HAVE FACED THE PROPOSED SHELTER SAYS HE WENT TO MEETINGS TO LEARN BOTH SIDES OF THE SHELTER DEBATE
471c0302 BUT JUST FOR WANTING TO HEAR THE PROS AND CONS I BECAME A PRO DERELICT REVOLUTIONARY IN THE EYES OF SOME PEOPLE HE RECALLS
471c0303 THEY DIDN'T WANT AN OBJECTIVE STUDY
471c0304 THEY JUST WANTED TO PREVENT THE ONSLAUGHT OF THE BUMS

471c030p COMMISSION REGULATIONS PROHIBIT THE SALE OF PACIFIERS WITH STRINGS AND REQUIRE A LABEL WARNING AGAINST THIS PRACTICE
471c030q ANY FURTHER EFFORT TO REDUCE THE HAZARDS ASSOCIATED WITH PACIFIERS WOULD DIVERT ATTENTION AND RESOURCES FROM GREATER DANGERS AND THE WARNINGS PROBABLY WOULD CAUSE NEEDLESS WORRY
471c030r JUDGE BORK'S LIKELY DEFEAT IS A TURNING POINT IN OUR CONSTITUTIONAL HISTORY PRECISELY BECAUSE IT IS NOT A TURNING POINT
471c030s NEVER BEFORE HAS A SUPREME COURT NOMINEE BEEN DEFEATED BECAUSE OF HIS GENERAL APPROACH TO THE CONSTITUTION

471c0315 IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE SCIENTISTS SPECULATE THAT DURING ATTEMPTS TO REPAIR THE *ARTERY* WALL THE BODY AT SOME POINT TRIES TO DISSOLVE A BLOOD CLOT
471c0316 BUT IT MISTAKENLY GRABS PROTEIN A. INSTEAD OF PLASMINOGEN PULLING IT WITH ITS BAG OF FAT AND CHOLESTEROL INTO THE *ARTERY* WALL
471c0317 <NOISE> THIS THWARTS THE REPAIR PROCESS AND BEGINS A VICIOUS CYCLE DRAWING MORE AND MORE CHOLESTEROL INTO THE DAMAGED AREA
471c0318 AND IN FACT MICROSCOPIC BLOOD CLOTS AND BITS OF L. P. A. ARE FOUND IN THE MISHMASH OF THE DEPOSITS
471c0319 MANY TRADERS ASSUME THE FINANCING WILL CONSIST OF THREE YEAR NOTES TEN YEAR NOTES AND THIRTY YEAR BONDS
471c031a BUT SOME TRADERS SAY THEY AREN'T SO SURE THERE WILL BE ANY THIRTY YEAR BONDS
471c031b THE REASON PRESIDENT REAGAN HASN'T YET SIGNED A TAX BILL WITH A PROVISION THAT WOULD INCREASE THE GOVERMENT'S LONG TERM BOND ISSUANCE AUTHORITY

471c0402 SOME ADMINISTRATION AND CONGRESSIONAL AIDES THINK CONGRESS WILL GO ALONG WITH SELLING THE PETROLEUM RESERVE THIS YEAR
471c0403 BUT RESISTANCE TO THE BOONVILLE IDEA WAS SO STRONG THAT LAWMAKERS PASSED A RESOLUTION PROHIBITING THE ADMINISTRATION FROM SPENDING ANY FEDERAL MONEY TO STUDY IT
471c0404 SUCH RESULTS ARE CAUSING SOME WALL STREET PROFESSIONALS TO TAKE THE JANUARY INDICATOR LESS SERIOUSLY THAN THEY USED TO

472c020l <NOISE> SEPARATELY PACIFIC LIGHTING COMPLETED THE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED SALE OF ITS LAND DEVELOPMENT SUBSIDIARIES <NOISE> TO TWO INVESTMENT GROUPS FOR THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS
472c020m THE SALE WILL RESULT IN A FOURTH QUARTER GAIN OF ABOUT TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS <NOISE> OR TWENTY CENTS A SHARE
472c020n <NOISE> THE COMPANY EARLIER HAD SAID IT HAD EXPECTED TO POST THE GAIN FOR THE THIRD QUARTER
472c020o <NOISE> EDGAR S. WOOLARD DU PONT'S PRESIDENT AND CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER <NOISE> NURTURED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE VENTURE
472c020p <NOISE> HE SAYS DU PONT IS STILL VERY OPTIMISTIC <NOISE> ABOUT ITS PROSPECTS <NOISE> BUT HE ACKNOWLEDGES HURDLES THAT MUST BE OVERCOME
472c020q <NOISE> THE REAL CHALLENGE HE SAYS <NOISE> IS WHETHER PHILIPS DU PONT OPTICAL <NOISE> CAN GET THERE AND STAY AHEAD
472c020r FOR A SHIP OR MISSILE GUIDED BY THE WRONG TIME SIGNAL <NOISE> THAT LITTLE GAP COULD MEAN ARRIVING AT THE WRONG DESTINATION
472c020s <NOISE> IF WE LET THE DIFFERENCE GROW SAYS MR. MCCARTHY WE COULD RUN INTO PROBLEMS OVER THOUSANDS OF YEARS
472c020t IT MIGHT BE NOON BY ATOMIC TIME BUT DARK OUTSIDE
472c020u AS SOON AS TWO MONTHS FROM NOW ARGENTINE COURTS ARE DUE TO TRY THE LAST GROUP OF GENERALS STILL SUBJECT TO PROSECUTION FOR ALLEGED HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES
472c020v <NOISE> THE PROCEEDINGS ARE THE LAST CHANCE TO BRING MILITARY MEN TO CIVILIAN JUSTICE
472c020w <NOISE> SO FAR IN FOUR YEARS OF CIVILIAN GOVERNMENT SEVEN TOP MILITARY OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN CONVICTED
472c020x <NOISE> CHARGES WERE BROUGHT AGAINST HUNDREDS OF OTHERS BUT PROSECUTIONS WERE HALTED LAST YEAR IN THE FACE OF ARMY RESTIVENESS
472c020y THE ARGUMENT WAS THAT THE ACCUSED OFFICERS HAD ONLY BEEN ACTING UNDER ORDERS
472c020z MRS. BATES FOR ONE IS NO FAN OF HYPNOSIS
472c0210 <NOISE> I THINK YOU CAN GET MOTIVATED WITHOUT ALL THIS VIOLENCE SHE SAYS
472c0211 WHEN MR. SIEGEL STARTED LEAVING VIOLENT MESSAGES ON THE FAMILY ANSWERING MACHINE LAST YEAR SHE SAW HER OPENING
472c0212 SHE ERASED THEM
472c0213 GROFF WOULDN'T IDENTIFY THE POTENTIAL BIDDERS AND SAID NO FIRM OFFERS HAVE BEEN MADE
472c0214 THE MAKER OF ALUMINUM PRODUCTS SAID IT HIRED THOMSON MCKINNON SECURITIES INCORPORATED <NOISE> TO HELP ASSESS ITS OPTIONS AND ADVISE IT ON ANY BIDS THAT MIGHT MATERIALIZE
472c0215 THE REVIEW MAY RESULT IN THE SALE OF THE COMPANY TO ANOTHER ENTITY GROFF SAID
472c0216 AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED WARNER AND LORIMAR AGREED IN MAY TO MERGE IN A STOCK SWAP VALUED AT ABOUT SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION DOLLARS
472c0217 <NOISE> CHRIS CRAFT INDUSTRIES INCORPORATED WARNER'S LARGEST SHAREHOLDER HAS FILED SUIT TO DELAY THE MERGER CHARGING THAT IT VIOLATES CHRIS CRAFT'S SHAREHOLDER AGREEMENT WITH WARNER
472c0218 <NOISE> NEVERTHELESS WARNER HAS SAID IT PLANS TO PROCEED WITH THE MERGER ANYWAY
472c0219 <NOISE> IN CONNECTICUT'S SENATE RACE TRADITIONAL POLITICS IS TURNED UPSIDE DOWN
472c021a IT IS HARDLY ANY WONDER THAT TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE LIKELY VOTERS IN THE STATE ARE UNDECIDED ANOTHER WORD FOR CONFUSED
472c021b SETTING THE UNDECIDED VOTERS ASIDE THE CONTEST IS CLOSE WITH THE LATEST HARTFORD COURANT CONNECTICUT POLL SHOWING THE TWO CANDIDATES NECK AND NECK
472c021c <NOISE> MR. LIEBERMAN'S SUPPORTERS ARE SPORTING BUTTONS THAT READ DEAD HEAT
472c021d INVESTORS CONTINUE TO FLOCK TO THE MORE CONSERVATIVE STOCK PORTFOLIOS
472c021e <NOISE> GROWTH AND INCOME FUNDS WHICH COMBINE HEFTY DIVIDENDS WITH THE GOAL OF CAPITAL APPRECIATION LED ALL OTHER STOCK FUND CATEGORIES IN SALES FOR JUNE
472c021f <NOISE> AMONG BOND FUNDS LONG TERM MUNICIPAL FUNDS CAPTURED THE TOP SPOT
472c0301 MR. HENKEL A FORMER ATLANTA ATTORNEY WAS APPOINTED TO THE THREE MEMBER BANK BOARD BY PRESIDENT REAGAN NOVEMBER SEVENTH
472c0302 HE HAS PUT ALL HIS BUSINESS INTERESTS THAT HAD TRANSACTIONS WITH THRIFTS INCLUDING THOSE WITH LOANS FROM LINCOLN INTO A BLIND TRUST
472c0303 <NOISE> HE HAS ALSO SAID HE INTENDS TO RECUSE HIMSELF FROM BANK BOARD VOTES SPECIFICALLY INVOLVING THRIFTS HE HAS DEALT WITH INCLUDING LINCOLN
472c0304 <NOISE> THE MINING WAS A CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF COVERT ACTIVITY <NOISE> ADVANCING NATIONAL SECURITY GOALS SECRETLY
472c0305 <NOISE> THE CORINTO MINING HAD A SENSIBLE U. S. SECURITY OBJECTIVE CURTAILING THE SHIPMENT OF SOVIET BLOC ARMS TO CENTRAL AMERICA THROUGH THE COMMUNIST GOVERNMENT OF NICARAGUA
472c0306 THE EXISTENCE OF THE OPERATION LEAKED OUT AND ONCE EXPOSED DETAILS FLOWED FREELY FROM CONGRESS
472c0307 <NOISE> THE ACTIVITY ENDED
472c0308 THIS EXAMPLE IS NOT UNIQUE
472c0309 <NOISE> OPPONENTS OF COVERT ACTIVITY HAVE DISCOVERED THAT BY LEAKING COVERT OPERATIONS INTO THE NEWS <NOISE> THEY CAN CREATE A *DEBILITATING* AURA OF SUSPICION AND ILLEGITIMACY AROUND <NOISE> FOREIGN POLICIES THEY DISLIKE
472c030a <NOISE> THE COMPANIES' SHARPLY IMPROVED RESULTS PROVIDED MORE EVIDENCE OF A REBOUND <NOISE> IN BOTH THE CHIP AND PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRIES
472c030b <NOISE> THE RESULTS FOLLOW A REPORT LAST WEEK FROM THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION <NOISE> THAT THE BELEAGUERED CHIP INDUSTRY IS EXPERIENCING AN UPTURN
472c030c IN MARCH THE INDUSTRY'S LEADING INDICATOR REACHED THE HIGHEST LEVEL SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR
472c030d <NOISE> I. R. E. HAS DOWNSIZED ITS REAL ESTATE SYNDICATION BUSINESS AND IS PRIMARILY A SAVINGS AND LOAN HOLDING COMPANY <NOISE> MR. LEVAN SAID
472c030e EARNINGS IN THE PAST WERE SOMEWHAT ERRATIC QUARTER TO QUARTER BECAUSE THE MAJOR BUSINESS WAS REAL ESTATE SYNDICATION
472c030f <NOISE> NOW THE S. AND L. HOLDING COMPANY IS THE MAIN BUSINESS WITH DOWN SIZED REAL ESTATE SYNDICATION
472c030g CORE EARNINGS ARE VERY CONSISTENT
472c030h <NOISE> SINCE THE PRESIDENTIAL AND CONGRESSIONAL CAMPAIGNS WILL DOMINATE NATIONAL ATTENTION NEXT YEAR <NOISE> THERE WILL BE RELATIVELY LITTLE FOCUS ON STATE RACES
472c030i <NOISE> PARTLY TO AVOID OVERTLY INSERTING PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS INTO STATE POLITICS <NOISE> MANY STATES HAVE CHANGED THE DATE OF THEIR STATEHOUSE ELECTIONS TO OFF YEARS
472c030j <NOISE> AS A RESULT ONLY TWELVE OF THE FIFTY STATES FEW OF THEM LARGE ARE ELECTING GOVERNORS NEXT YEAR
472c030k LINCOLN HAS ABOUT TWO MILLION COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING
472c030l YESTERDAY IN COMPOSITE TRADING ON THE AMERICAN STOCK EXCHANGE <NOISE> LINCOLN CLOSED AT ELEVEN POINT ONE TWO FIVE DOLLARS A SHARE UP TWELVE AND A HALF CENTS
472c030m <NOISE> BASED ON THAT PRICE LINCOLN'S COMMON SHARES HAVE A TOTAL MARKET VALUE OF ABOUT TWENTY TWO POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS
472c030n THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE PROPOSAL WOULD PLACE TIGHTER CONTROLS ON THE EXCHANGE'S <NOISE> AUTOMATED ORDER EXECUTION COMPUTER SYSTEM CALLED SUPERDOT WHICH IS CENTRAL TO MOST PROGRAM TRADING
472c030o <NOISE> A SECOND PROPOSAL SAID TO BE BEFORE THE BOARD WOULD ELIMINATE ALL PROGRAM TRADING USING THE SUPERDOT SYSTEM
472c030p BUT THAT PROPOSAL IS GIVEN A SMALLER CHANCE OF PASSING THE BOARD THE SOURCES SAID
472c030q BUT SENATOR DAVID BOREN DEMOCRAT OF OKLAHOMA THE CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE WAS LESS OPTIMISTIC
472c030r <NOISE> THIS IS NO WAY TO BEGIN A RELATIONSHIP UNDER A TREATY AS IMPORTANT AS THIS <NOISE> IF THESE DELIBERATE AMBIGUITIES REMAIN HE TOLD REPORTERS
472c030s SENATOR COHEN ALSO SAID HE IS LESS OPTIMISTIC THAT THE U. S. SOVIET DIFFERENCES CAN BE RESOLVED QUICKLY
472c030t <NOISE> ONE OF THE MORE DIRECT READINGS ON INFLATION WILL COME IN FRIDAY'S REPORT ON CONSUMER PRICES <NOISE> WHICH ARE EXPECTED NOT SURPRISINGLY TO BE HIGHER
472c030u ANALYSTS EXPECT AN INCREASE OF ABOUT POINT FOUR PERCENT IN THE APRIL CONSUMER PRICE INDEX ON THE HEELS OF A POINT FIVE PERCENT JUMP THE PREVIOUS MONTH
472c030v <NOISE> THE PRICE INCREASES ARE EXPECTED PRETTY MUCH ACROSS THE BOARD AS COMMODITIES AND SERVICES ARE RISING AT ABOUT A FOUR PERCENT ANNUAL RATE
472c030w IT HAS NOW BEEN ELEVEN NIGHTS SINCE THE ARREST OF FRANCIS SEOW FORMER SOLICITOR GENERAL AND LAW SOCIETY PRESIDENT IN SINGAPORE
472c030x <NOISE> WHILE PRIME MINISTER LEE KUAN YEW'S GOVERNMENT HAS ADMITTED HOLDING MR. SEOW IT HAS KEPT HIM TOTALLY INCOMMUNICADO
472c030y <NOISE> IT HAS REFUSED REQUESTS TO SEE HIM FROM BOTH HIS FAMILY AND HIS LAWYER

472c0311 THE UNION IS TO VOTE TODAY ON WHETHER TO APPROVE A NUMBER OF SEPARATE AGREEMENTS WITH INDEPENDENT PRODUCERS <NOISE> ALTHOUGH A SPOKESMAN SAID THE LETTERMAN SHOW ISN'T ONE OF THEM
472c0312 <NOISE> F. P. L. SAID THE ACQUISITION WOULD BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS A POOLING OF INTERESTS
472c0313 TURNER OWNS ABOUT TWELVE THOUSAND ACRES IN SOUTHWEST FLORIDA TEN THOUSAND OF WHICH ARE CITRUS GROVES
472c0314 <NOISE> F. P. L. SAID THE ACQUISITION INCREASES ITS CITRUS ACREAGE TO TWENTY TWO THOUSAND
472c0315 FRANKFURT SHARE PRICES CLOSED MOSTLY LOWER IN MODERATELY ACTIVE TRADING FRIDAY <NOISE> AS AN EARLY RALLY FIZZLED AMID POSITION SQUARING <NOISE> BEFORE THE WEEKEND AND UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE LOWER DOLLAR
472c0316 <NOISE> THE D. A. X. INDEX DROPPED FIVE POINT FOUR NINE <NOISE> TO TWELVE EIGHTY NINE POINT SEVEN TWO
472c0317 <NOISE> AFTER OPENING BROADLY HIGHER THE TIDE TURNED AT MIDDAY WHEN THE DOLLAR'S SLIDE TO A THREE MONTH LOW BEGAN TO WORRY MARKET PARTICIPANTS
472c0318 <NOISE> THAT FIGHT WHILE REMARKABLE FOR ITS BITTERNESS TYPIFIES THE CORE PROBLEM IN THE NATIONWIDE PUSH TO CONTAIN MEDICAL COST WHO GETS LESS
472c0319 <NOISE> DOCTORS WANT TO MAINTAIN THEIR AUTHORITY AND THEIR INCOMES
472c031a <NOISE> HOSPITALS ARE FIGHTING TO HANG ONTO REVENUE MORE THAN A THIRD OF WHICH COMES FROM MEDICARE
472c031b <NOISE> AND PATIENTS DON'T WANT TO SEE SERVICES DECREASE
472c031c BUT THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM NOW CONSUMES ABOUT ONE MILLION DOLLARS A MINUTE <NOISE> AND ALL AGREE IT NEEDS TAMING
472c031d <NOISE> THEN IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR NATIONAL UNION JOINED THE MARKET
472c031e <NOISE> ITS POLICY FOR STATE JUDGES THE BIGGEST CLIENTS COST EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR FOR A ONE MILLION DOLLAR POLICY WITH NO DEDUCTIBLE
472c031f THE JUDGES ARE COVERED FOR ACTS ERRORS OR OMISSIONS IN THE PERFORMANCE OF PROFESSIONAL DUTIES MR. BOLEN SAYS
472c0401 A YEAR EARLIER G. M. HUGHES HAD FIRST QUARTER PROFIT OF <NOISE> A HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS <NOISE> OR SEVENTY SEVEN CENTS A SHARE
472c0402 <NOISE> PER SHARE EARNINGS FOR THE NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN AND NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX QUARTERS <NOISE> BENEFITED FROM THIRTY SEVEN POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS OF GOOD WILL <NOISE> AMORTIZATION IN EACH PERIOD
472c0403 THE GOOD WILL AMORTIZATION REPRESENTS THE AMOUNT ABOVE BOOK VALUE THAT G. M. PAID FOR HUGHES AIRCRAFT
472c0404 THAT ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENT REPRESENTS A CHARGE AGAINST G. M.'S EARNINGS
472c0405 <NOISE> BEFORE FRIDAY <NOISE> IT SEEMED THAT ONLY AN UNEXPECTED BREAK IN THE DELAWARE COURT CASE COULD HAVE EXTRACTED HENLEY FROM THE DILEMMA IT NOW FACES
472c0406 THUS THE CASE WAS CLOSELY WATCHED
472c0407 BUT IT ALSO RAISED IMPORTANT ISSUES OF CORPORATE LAW
472c0408 <NOISE> THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THESE WAS A CONTENTION THAT SANTA FE'S BOARD ACTED ILLEGALLY LAST DECEMBER <NOISE> WHEN IT LOWERED THE THRESHHOLD FOR A SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN TO TWENTY PERCENT
472c0409 PREVIOUSLY THE RIGHTS OR POISON PILL WERE TRIGGERED AUTOMATICALLY ONLY IF FIFTY PERCENT OF THE STOCK WERE IN HOSTILE HANDS
472c040a <NOISE> S. D. I. DESPITE WHAT THE DEFENSE LUDDITES SAY <NOISE> IS NOT AN ADVENTURE IN TECHNOLOGY APPLICATION
472c040b IT IS A TOOL OF NATIONAL POLICY <NOISE> AND AS WITH ANY TOOL IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE USED WITH A SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE IN MIND
472c040c <NOISE> THE OBJECTIVE LEST WE FORGET IT IS TO PREVENT A GLOBAL NUCLEAR WAR
472c040d <NOISE> HIS INABILITY TO RECOVER FROM OCTOBER'S MARKET PLUNGE WAS TRACED TO A HOSTILE BID FROM TWO RIVAL <NOISE> FINANCIERS FOR BELL RESOURCES L. T. D. WHICH IS CONTROLLED BY BELL GROUP
472c040e <NOISE> THE BID FORCED MR. HOLMES A COURT TO CALL OFF <NOISE> A PROPOSED MERGER OF THE BELL COMPANIES
472c040f THAT WAS THE TURNING POINT SAID DARRYL SMALLEY <NOISE> A DIRECTOR AT THE PERTH BROKERAGE HARTLEY <NOISE> POYNTON L. T. D.
472c040g <NOISE> FINALLY THERE'S THE WELFARE PROBLEM
472c040h <NOISE> NOT ALL WORKERS ARE AS LUCKY AS JOSEPH
472c040i <NOISE> SOME GET SICK OR INJURED AND LOSE THEIR JOBS
472c040j <NOISE> OTHERS WHO TURNED THEIR LIFE SAVINGS OVER TO BROKERS IN ORDER TO GET HERE <NOISE> DISCOVER THAT PROMISES OF MONEY MEALS AND LODGING WERE BOGUS
472c040k <NOISE> FEAR OF DEPORTATION PREVENTS THEM FROM GOING TO THE POLICE FOR HELP
472c040l THERE ARE *UNCONFIRMED* REPORTS OF WORKERS STARVING TO DEATH HERE
472c040m <NOISE> BUT SOME ARGUE AGENDA COULD BE A BIG HIT AND CREATE A NEW CATEGORY OF SOFTWARE
472c040n THIS IS FUNDAMENTALLY NEW AND DIFFERENT
472c040o <NOISE> IT'S TREMENDOUSLY EXCITING SAYS ESTHER DYSON EDITOR OF RELEASE ONE POINT OH <NOISE> A NEWSLETTER THAT COVERS COMPUTER SOFTWARE
472c040p <NOISE> I THINK IT'S AN EXTREMELY USEFUL TOOL SAYS MORT ROSENTHAL <NOISE> CHAIRMAN OF CORPORATE SOFTWARE INCORPORATED <NOISE> A WESTWOOD MASSACHUSETTS BASED SOFTWARE DISTRIBUTOR
472c040q <NOISE> HE SAYS HE USES AGENDA MORE THAN ANY OTHER SOFTWARE
472c040r IMPERIAL SAYS IT HAS HAD TERRIFIC UNSOLICITED INTEREST IN THE MATERIAL FROM ALL AREAS OF PLASTICS USES
472c040s BUT THE COST OF MANUFACTURING THE NATURAL PLASTIC IS PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE FIFTEEN DOLLARS A POUND COMPARED WITH ROUGHLY SIXTY FIVE CENTS A POUND FOR CONVENTIONAL PLASTIC
472c040t <NOISE> HOWEVER THE COMPANY SAYS IT HOPES TO REDUCE MANUFACTURING COSTS ENOUGH TO BEGIN MARKETING THE PLASTIC IN TWO TO FIVE YEARS
472c040u MR. HEFTER OF JEFFERIES SAYS INVESTORS ARE BASICALLY PICKING SOME STOCKS IN WHICH THEY HAVE SITUATIONS GOING THAT THEY HAVE A DEFINITE IDEA ABOUT
472c040v BUT IN GENERAL THE WAIT AND SEE ATTITUDE IS STILL VERY PREVALENT OUT THERE
472c040w <NOISE> THERE IS NO REAL PRESSURE TO JUMP INTO THE MARKET RIGHT NOW
472c040x MR. BETHELL HAS AN EYE FOR THE FASHIONABLE AND FOR THE ABOMINABLE WHICH TODAY ARE OFTEN THE SAME THING
472c040y <NOISE> HE OBVIOUSLY RELISHES A GOOD FIGHT <NOISE> AND SAYING NO TO THE CULTURAL BARBARIANS AND THE CURRENT WISDOM
472c040z HE USES PIG BLADDER HAMMER AND TONGS AND SCALPEL AND HE IS ADEPT WITH THEM ALL AS THE ELECTRIC WINDMILL SHOWS
472c0410 <NOISE> THE BIG ATTRACTION IS THAT THE NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT SUMMER OLYMPICS AREN'T REALLY BEING HELD IN THE SUMMER
472c0411 G. M. WHICH HAS LOST ABOUT EIGHT PERCENT OF THE U. S. CAR MARKET IN RECENT YEARS FIGURES THE GAMES' LATE SEPTEMBER TIMING IS IDEAL
472c0412 IT ALSO HOPES THE GAMES WILL ATTRACT UPSCALE VIEWERS WHO NORMALLY DON'T TUNE INTO SPORTS
472c0413 DURING THAT CAMPAIGN AS IN EARLIER ONES <NOISE> A FEW LOW AND MIDDLE RANKING OFFICIALS WERE ARRESTED OR DISMISSED
472c0414 BUT NO LEADING CADRES OR THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS WERE PUNISHED <NOISE> FUELING CYNICISM AMONG THE MASSES
472c0415 <NOISE> AND THE CORPORATION PROBLEM SEEMED ONLY TO GET WORSE
472c0416 GETTING THE DEAL RIGHT IS THE KEY
472c0417 UNLIKE WARRANTS ON JAPANESE STOCKS DEALS FOR U. S. COMPANIES AREN'T REALLY COVERED BY THE OWNERSHIP OF UNDERLYING SHARES
472c0418 INSTEAD UNDERWRITERS USE WHAT THEY CALL A DYNAMIC HEDGE
472c0419 <NOISE> EACH IS DIFFERENT BUT USUALLY INVOLVES A COMBINATION OF STOCK OPTION PURCHASES <NOISE> ARRANGED BY THE HOME OFFICE IN NEW YORK
472c041a <NOISE> SOME OF THAT CASH HAS BEEN USED FOR BONUS PAYMENTS
472c041b <NOISE> WAGES AND BONUSES ROSE NINETEEN PERCENT IN THE FIRST HALF <NOISE> A RATE THAT FAR OUTPACED ECONOMIC GROWTH AND EXERTED UPWARD PRESSURE ON PRICES
472c041c CHINA'S ECONOMY GREW AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF FIVE POINT SEVEN PERCENT IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS <NOISE> ROUGHLY HALF THE AVERAGE ANNUAL RATE IN THE PAST DECADE
473c0201 WICKES HAD MADE ITS FRIENDLY OFFER FOR LEAR SIEGLER TO HELP ITS SANTA MONICA NEIGHBOR WARD OFF A. F. G. PARTNERS' INITIAL TAKEOVER BID LAST MONTH
473c0202 BUT WICKES WHICH HAD SIGNED AN AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE LEAR FOR ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION BACKED OFF AFTER HAVING PROBLEMS ARRANGING FINANCING ON SATISFACTORY TERMS
473c0203 WICKES HAS DECLINED COMMENT SINCE SAYING THAT IT WAS OFFICIALLY CONTINUING EFFORTS TO ARRANGE FINANCING <NOISE> BUT WASN'T OPTIMISTIC ABOUT ITS CHANCES
473c0204 THE ADMINISTRATION HAS OCCASIONALLY MOUTHED COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE PRIVATE EXPRESS STATUTES THE LAWS THAT PROHIBIT FREE CHOICE IN MAIL SERVICE BUT HAS DONE LITTLE ASIDE FROM TALK
473c0205 <NOISE> THE WHITE HOUSE INTERVENED EARLIER LAST YEAR TO STOP THE POSTAL SERVICE FROM BANNING PRIVATE COMPANIES FROM SHIPPING BUNDLES OF LETTERS OVERSEAS TO BE DEPOSITED DIRECTLY IN FOREIGN MAIL SYSTEMS
473c0206 BUT THIS WAS FAIRLY MINOR
473c0207 <NOISE> THE GOVERNMENT CIVIL SUIT ALLEGED THAT A DEFECT COULD CAUSE THE REAR BRAKES TO LOCK SENDING THE CAR SPINNING OUT OF CONTROL
473c0208 G. M. WHICH NO LONGER MAKES X. CARS DENIED THAT THE BRAKES ARE DEFECTIVE
473c0209 AGREEING WITH G. M. JUDGE JACKSON RULED THAT THE GOVERNMENT CAME TO COURT WITH NOTHING MORE ESSENTIALLY THAN A REASONABLE SUSPICION THAT A DEFECT EXISTED
473c020a BY NOW THERE IS LITTLE ELSE MR. FALCIGNO CAN DO TO HYPE ATTENDANCE
473c020b THAT DOESN'T MEAN HE DOESN'T HAVE OTHER WORRIES
473c020c COUNTERFEIT TICKETS HAVE BEEN A PROBLEM ALTHOUGH A NEW TYPE OF TICKET WITH A SPECIAL EDGE AND WEAVE SEEMS TO HAVE PROVIDED A TEMPORARY SOLUTION
473c020d NOT A SINGLE BROADCAST SIGNAL WAS PIRATED FROM THE ONE THOUSAND PLUS SITES RECEIVING THE HAGLER LEONARD FIGHT <NOISE> THANKS TO A NEWLY DEVELOPED DECODER BOX
473c020e THE JOURNAL'S CLIFFORD KRAUSS LAST MONTH DESCRIBED THE DEEP ANTIPATHY AMONG THE LOCAL POPULATION TOWARDS THE POLICIES AND SURVEILLANCE TECHNIQUES OF THE SANDINISTAS' INTERNAL TRADE MINISTRY
473c020f IN THE AMERICAS COLUMN PUBLISHED ON THIS PAGE LAST FRIDAY DOUGLAS PAYNE DESCRIBED NICARAGUA'S GROWING ECONOMIC INTEGRATION WITH THE SOVIET BLOC
473c020g AND YESTERDAY ON THE WASHINGTON POST'S OP ED PAGE LA PRENSA PUBLISHER VIOLETA CHAMORRO DESCRIBED THE EXTENT OF PRESS CENSORSHIP
473c020h THE REACTION FROM THE FREE WORLD SHE WROTE AND THE LEADERS WHO CALL THEMSELVES DEMOCRATS HAS BEEN LITTLE
473c020i THE SEVEN SIGNATORIES HAVE AGREED TO POLICIES AIMED AT REDUCING THEIR INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL IMBALANCES
473c020j THUS THEY ARE MAKING A CONTRIBUTION TO STABILIZING THEIR EXCHANGE RELATIONS JEOPARDIZED BY THE HIGHLY EXCESSIVE DEFICITS AND SURPLUSES THAT HAVE DEVELOPED IN RECENT YEARS
473c020k MOREOVER THEY ARE READY IF NEED BE TO INTERVENE ON EXCHANGE MARKETS
473c020l ANALYST THOMAS ROONEY OF DONALDSON LUFKIN AND JENRETTE GOT SCORES OF CALLS FROM CLIENTS ABOUT THE RUMORS
473c020m HE ESTIMATES PRIME'S DOMESTIC BUSINESS MAY BE OFF TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE PERCENT WITH FOREIGN SALES UP BY ABOUT THE SAME PERCENTAGE
473c020n DOMESTIC SALES ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT HALF OF PRIME'S NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN REVENUE
473c020o AS A RESULT THE GOVERNMENT IS TALKING OF HIGHER FARM PRICES
473c020p BUT HIGHER FARM PRICES WOULD ADD TO AN ALREADY STEEP INFLATION RATE
473c020q SO BEIJING OFFICIALS REPORTEDLY TALK OF TYING WAGES TO INFLATION AN IDEA REMINISCENT OF THE WAGE INDEXATION TRIED IN SOME LATIN AMERICAN NATIONS SEVERAL YEARS AGO WITH DISASTROUS RESULTS
473c020r THE AGREEMENT CALLS FOR DOVER TO MAKE A TENDER OFFER FOR CHIEF AUTOMOTIVE'S EIGHT POINT THREE MILLION SHARES OUTSTANDING
473c020s EACH CHIEF AUTOMOTIVE SHARE THAT ISN'T TENDERED WILL BE CONVERTED INTO A RIGHT TO RECEIVE FIFTEEN DOLLARS IN CASH DOVER SAID
473c020t THE OFFER BEGAN TODAY AND IT IS SET TO EXPIRE AT MIDNIGHT E. D. T. JULY TWENTIETH
473c020u BANKAMERICA OFFICIALS HOPE THAT LIKE THE EARLIER PROBLEMS THE IMPROVING FINANCES WILL FEED ON THEMSELVES
473c020v IT IS COUNTING ON A STRONGER CREDIT RATING TO ALLOW IT TO BECOME MORE THAN A MINOR LEAGUER IN PITCHING LUCRATIVE INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY SWAPS
473c020w MONEY TO PROMOTE A FLAGGING GLOBAL CORPORATE COMPUTER SERVICE IS BECOMING AVAILABLE
473c020x SO IS SUPPORT FOR A BEEFED UP TEAM OF DEAL MAKERS TO BROKER MERGERS AMONG CALIFORNIA COMPANIES
473c020y NONE OF THESE AREAS HOWEVER HOLD THE PROSPECT OF QUICK GROWTH
473c020z SO FAR THE ADMINISTRATION HAS IGNORED THESE APPEALS AND SO HAVE MR. REED AND OTHER BANKERS
473c0210 IT SEEMS THAT THE PRINCIPLES ENUNCIATED AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS DECADE BY MESSRS.
473c0211 WRISTON AND THEOBALD STILL PREVAIL IF NOT IN LENDING THE BANK'S MONEY AT LEAST IN SUGGESTING THAT OTHER INVESTORS PUT UP THE CASH
473c0212 HOWEVER CONVENTIONAL FILM WILL BE MARGINALLY PROFITABLE AT BEST FOR POLAROID BECAUSE INITIALLY POLAROID WON'T BE MANUFACTURING THE FILM CONTENDS ELLIOTT NOVAK AN INDUSTRY CONSULTANT
473c0213 INSTEAD IT WILL BUY THE FILM FROM ANOTHER COMPANY AND PUT ITS NAME ON IT JUST AS IT DOES WITH VIDEOTAPE
473c0214 SINCE IT BEGAN SELLING VIDEOTAPE A FEW YEARS AGO POLAROID HAS BUILT UP AN IMPRESSIVE TWELVE PERCENT MARKET SHARE MAKING IT THE LEADER IN THE U. S.
473c0215 BUT FIERCE COMPETITION HAS KEPT VIDEOTAPE PROFITS SLIM AND THE CONVENTIONAL FILM BUSINESS ISN'T LIKELY TO PROVE ANY BONANZA EITHER
473c0216 REACTING TO THE EROSION OF CONFUCIAN VALUES MANY KOREANS ARE TURNING TO RELIGION ESPECIALLY CHRISTIANITY
473c0217 BUDDHISM IS ENJOYING A RESURGENCE AS WELL
473c0218 THEY'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING SAYS MR. SEO
473c0219 OTHERS ARE LOOKING TO THE PAST
473c021a ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES STUDENTS ARE JOINING CLUBS TO LEARN TRADITIONAL KOREAN ARTS AND CRAFTS
473c021b MANY ANTI GOVERNMENT ANTI AMERICAN STUDENT DEMONSTRATIONS ARE CARRIED OUT TO THE BEAT OF TRADITIONAL KOREAN DRUMS
473c021c MR. HOOVER DISAGREES
473c021d HE CONTENDS THAT THE FRIED FRANK LAWSUIT FOLLOWED !HIS THREAT OF A LAWSUIT AND SAID THE EIGHTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IN FEES WERE BILLED FOR HOURS MR.
473c021e VARTANIAN DIDN'T EXPEND FOR WORK WE DIDN'T REQUEST
473c0301 WE HAVE A SEVERE BUSINESS SITUATION BECAUSE OF THE YEN'S APPRECIATION AND TRADE FRICTION AN OFFICIAL OF BROTHER INDUSTRIES SAYS
473c0302 IN MID NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN THE COMPANY WILL BEGIN MAKING ELECTRONIC TYPEWRITERS IN BARTLETT TENNESSEE
473c0303 IT SET UP A SIMILAR PLANT IN WALES IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE
473c0304 AS A RESULT MANY INSURANCE ISSUES ARE DOWN TEN TO TWENTY FIVE PERCENT FROM THEIR HIGHS REACHED MOSTLY LAST SPRING
473c0305 THE BULLS ARGUE HOWEVER THAT SELLERS ARE LEAVING THE PARTY TOO SOON
473c0306 FOR ONE THING THEY SAY THE LARGE PREMIUM INCREASES OF THE PAST FEW YEARS HAVE ONLY BEGUN TO APPEAR IN INSURERS' BOTTOM LINES
473c0307 FOR NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN EARNINGS GAINS OF TWENTY FIVE TO MORE THAN FIFTY PERCENT FROM NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX LEVELS ARE ALMOST A CERTAINTY AT THESE COMPANIES
473c0308 AND MOST ANALYSTS EXPECT THE EARNINGS GROWTH TO CONTINUE ALBEIT AT A MORE MODEST RATE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT
473c0309 HOWEVER ONE SOURCE CLOSE TO THE COMPANIES SAID HE WOULDN'T RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF LIMITED BUYING I. MAGNIN
473c030a LIMITED CHAIRMAN LESLIE H. WEXNER HAS SAID HE IS INTERESTED IN OPERATING A SPECIALTY DEPARTMENT STORE
473c030b LIMITED OPERATES SUCH STORES AS LIMITED LIMITED EXPRESS LANE BRYANT HENRI BENDEL AND VICTORIA'S SECRET
473c030c TO GET AROUND THAT REQUIREMENT INSURERS CAN PAY A REINSURER TO ASSUME PART OF THE RISK OF LOSS ON THE ANNUITY IN RETURN FOR PART OF THE PREMIUM
473c030d BUT MOST REINSURANCE CONTRACTS DON'T TRANSFER INVESTMENT RISK THE RISK OF FAILING TO EARN ENOUGH TO PAY THE PROMISED RATES
473c030e THAT'S WHERE FIRST EXECUTIVE WHICH HAS RELIED HEAVILY ON REINSURANCE TO SUPPORT EXPANSION OF IT BUSINESS AND THE REGULATORS HAVEN'T AGREED ON THE PROPER FORM OF CONTRACT
473c030f THE KROH BROTHERS MISMANAGED BUT IT WAS NOT FOR THE PURPOSE OF LINING THEIR OWN POCKETS HE SAYS
473c030g THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN KANSAS CITY WHO HAVE TURNED THEIR BACKS ON THEM
473c030h BUT IF YOU'RE A FRIEND YOU'RE A FRIEND IN BAD TIMES AS WELL AS GOOD
473c030i IN VIEDMA MEANWHILE DEPUTY GOVERNOR OSCAR MACHADO EXUDES PROVINCIAL CONFIDENCE
473c030j HE HAS PUT UP A SIGN IN THE MAIN SQUARE WELCOMING VISITORS TO THE NEW FEDERAL CAPITAL
473c030k HE ACTUALLY BELIEVES HIS CORNER OF PATAGONIA WILL SOON BE ADORNED WITH NEW ROADS TELEPHONES EMBASSIES AND HOTELS
473c030l HE SAYS HE EXPECTS PRESIDENT ALFONSIN TO START COMING REGULARLY NEXT YEAR
473c030m BOSTON BASED FIDELITY THIS YEAR BECAME THE LARGEST MUTUAL FUND GROUP IN THE U. S.
473c030n IT TRADITIONALLY HAS SOLD ITS FUNDS THROUGH DIRECT MARKETING TECHNIQUES SUCH AS NEWSPAPER AND MAGAZINE ADVERTISING BACKED BY A TELEPHONE NETWORK
473c030o ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY CLEARLY ISN'T ABANDONING SUCH METHODS IT IS LOOKING TO BROKER DEALERS TO SELL THE NEW FUND LINE
473c030p <NOISE> THE UNION SAID THE WORKERS' COMPLAINTS PERSUADED IT TO PLACE A TEAM OF ORGANIZERS IN SMYRNA LAST JULY
473c030q IT HAS STARTED COLLECTING SUPPORT CARDS FROM EMPLOYEES AND IF THIRTY PERCENT OF THE PLANT'S THIRTY TWO HUNDRED WORKERS SIGN UP THE UNION CAN REQUEST AN ELECTION
473c030r MR. BIEBER SAID THE UNION HASN'T SET A DEADLINE TO COMPLETE THE DRIVE
473c030s AFTER COLLECTING THE SIGNATURES THE U. A. W. CAN ASK NISSAN TO RECOGNIZE THE UNION WITHOUT AN ELECTION ALTHOUGH ACQUIESCENCE BY NISSAN ISN'T CONSIDERED LIKELY
473c030t EVENTUALLY THOUGH SHE BURNED OUT ON BODY BUILDING
473c030u IT WAS OBSESSIVE IT WAS UNHEALTHY SHE RECALLS
473c030v I LEARNED THAT IT'S NOT NECESSARY TO BE SO COMPULSIVE

473c0408 BRAZIL ALSO WOULD BE REQUIRED TO AGREE ON AN ECONOMIC PROGRAM WITH THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
473c0409 ANY AGREEMENT WITH THE I. M. F. IS LIKELY TO PROVOKE STRONG OPPOSITION IN BRAZIL WHERE THE FUND IS LOATHED FOR PROMOTING AUSTERITY
473c040a AND THERE IS SPECULATION THAT MR. BRESSER MAY RESIGN OR ALLOW HIMSELF TO BE OUSTED AS A SACRIFICE FOR SECURING AN I. M. F. PROGRAM

473c040h A MERGER WITH MACY WHICH IS ROUGHLY HALF THE SIZE OF FEDERATED COULD BE ATTRACTIVE TO THE LARGER RETAILER'S EXECUTIVES
473c040i MACY'S SMALLER SIZE COULD LEAVE FEDERATED'S OFFICERS WITH OPERATING POWER IN A COMBINED CONCERN
473c040j AND FEELINGS AT FEDERATED HAVE RUN HIGH AGAINST CAMPEAU WHICH SURPRISED THE COMPANY WITH A HOSTILE BID LAST MONTH
473c040k HOWEVER CAMPEAU'S BID IS ALL CASH AND THE MACY BID ISN'T
473c040l THE PROPOSED MERGER OF COMEX AND THE RIVAL NEW YORK MERCANTILE EXCHANGE IS A BIG ISSUE HOWEVER
473c040m NYMEX HAS PUT MERGER TALKS ON HOLD UNTIL IT SEES WHO THE NEW COMEX CHAIRMAN IS
473c040n WE CAN'T CONTINUE AS A METALS EXCHANGE
473c040o WE MUST EXPAND THROUGH MERGER MR. HANEMANN SAYS
473c040p MR. GARVEY DOESN'T STRESS A NYMEX MERGER NEARLY AS MUCH AS HIS OPPONENT BUT SAYS HE'S ONE HUNDRED PERCENT IN FAVOR OF MERGER
473c040q THE FED WILL REMAIN VIGILANT AGAINST A RE ACCELERATION OF INFLATION MR. JOHNSON VOWED
473c040r HE ADDED THOUGH I AM REASONABLY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE INFLATION OUTLOOK
473c040s WAGE INCREASES HAVE REMAINED MODERATE AND GIVEN THE RECENT SOFTNESS IN OIL PRICES ENERGY PRICES SHOULD PUT A DAMPER ON CONSUMER AND PRODUCER PRICE INCREASES

473c040z EVEN THOUGH THE ISSUE CONCERNED FUTURE SECURITY RATHER THAN TODAY'S SAFETY

473c0412 MR. MINOLI THE U. S. GENERAL MANAGER SAYS BENETTON RECENTLY DROPPED ITS STRATEGY OF SATURATING THE MARKET WITH SMALL STORES
473c0413 NOW IT IS CONCENTRATING ON PROFESSIONALISM AND THE SERVICING OF EXISTING STORES HE SAYS
473c0414 <NOISE> NEW STORES WILL BE LARGER OUTLETS CALLED UNITED COLORS THAT WILL OFFER A MUCH BROADER RANGE OF MERCHANDISE

473c041f THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION IS SEEKING A BUDGET AUTHORIZATION OF FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR A FIVE PERCENT INCREASE
474c0201 FOR INVESTORS THE PARTNERSHIPS ARE ONLY AS ATTRACTIVE AS THE UNDERLYING BUYOUTS
474c0202 MANY IN THE FIELD CONTEND THAT THE BUYOUTS BEING PUT TOGETHER THESE DAYS ARE GENERALLY OVERPRICED BECAUSE OF SEVERAL FACTORS
474c0203 <NOISE> AMONG THEM TOO MUCH CAPITAL CHASING TOO FEW GOOD CANDIDATES WHICH HAS PUSHED COSTS UP AND RETURNS DOWN TO WHAT THEY SEE AS UNACCEPTABLE LEVELS
474c0204 THE S. E. C. SANCTIONS AGAINST THE FIRM AND MR. BLINDER WERE HANDED DOWN IN DECEMBER
474c0205 THE RULINGS STEM FROM A NINETEEN EIGHTY UNDERWRITING BY MR. BLINDER AND HIS FIRM OF AMERICAN LEISURE CORPORATION A CASINO COMPANY IN NEW YORK
474c0206 THE S. E. C. ACCUSED THE BROKERAGE OF FRAUD IN THE DEAL
474c0207 MR. GITTIS SAID THE LAWSUITS WOULD HAVE LITTLE INFLUENCE ON THE RESPONSE OF REVLON'S BOARD TO THE TENDER OFFER
474c0208 HE SAID MACANDREWS AND FORBES RATHER THAN REVLON IS BORROWING THE MONEY NEEDED TO ACQUIRE REVLON AND TAKE IT PRIVATE
474c0209 WE'RE SELLING EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF NOTES IN A PRIVATE PLACEMENT HE SAID
474c020a IF WE WERE USING REVLON ASSETS THE SUITS COULD BE TROUBLESOME
474c020b INTEREST RATES WERE MIXED ON NEW SHORT TERM TREASURY BILLS AT THE GOVERNMENT'S REGULAR WEEKLY AUCTION YESTERDAY

474c020g FOR THE MONTH CONTINENTAL FLEW THREE POINT THREE BILLION REVENUE PASSENGER MILES A NINETY FIVE PERCENT INCREASE FROM THE ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION MILES A YEAR EARLIER
474c020h A REVENUE PASSENGER MILE IS ONE PAYING PASSENGER FLOWN ONE MILE
474c020i THE INCREASE REFLECTS THE CONSOLIDATION WITH PEOPLE EXPRESS
474c020j THE JAPANESE STOCK MARKET IS AWASH WITH LIQUIDITY MR. GRANT SAYS
474c020k BUT IN JUNE SUDDENLY WITH NO APPARENT DRAINAGE IT WENT DOWN AND KEPT GOING DOWN HE SAYS
474c020l WHAT IS A MYSTERY TO MR. GRANT AND MANY OTHERS IS THAT THE TOKYO MARKET HAS SINCE STAGED A VIGOROUS REBOUND
474c020m A ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR ISSUE OF HOUSEHOLD FINANCE CORPORATION SEVEN YEAR NOTES WAS OFFERED THROUGH UNDERWRITERS LED BY MERRILL LYNCH CAPITAL MARKETS
474c020n THE TEN PERCENT NOTES WERE PRICED AT PAR AND THE RETURN IS ZERO POINT SEVEN TWO OF A PERCENTAGE POINT ABOVE THE RATE ON COMPARABLE TREASURY NOTES
474c020o THE NOTES ARE RATED DOUBLE A. THREE BY MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE INCORPORATED AND DOUBLE A. MINUS BY STANDARD AND POOR'S CORPORATION
474c020p IF ITS MAVERICK STRATEGY WORKS SECURITY PACIFIC WILL BE SHOWING ANOTHER WAY BESIDES ACQUISITIONS FOR SUPERREGIONAL BANKS TO GROW
474c020q THESE BANKS' MANAGERS INCLUDING MR. FLAMSON PLAN TO EVENTUALLY CHALLENGE THE BIG NEW YORK BANKS AS NATIONAL GIANTS IN THEIR OWN RIGHT
474c020r BOLSTERED BY STRONG EQUITY CAPITAL POSITIONS SUPERREGIONALS ALREADY ARE GROWING FASTER THAN MONEY CENTER INSTITUTIONS
474c020s PASSAGE OF THE KENNEDY MARKEY BILL OR SIMILAR GRANTS OF MORAL RIGHTS WOULD ENRICH ESTABLISHED ARTISTS AT THE EXPENSE OF THEIR STRUGGLING COMPETITORS
474c020t IN ADDITION THE THEORY OF MORAL RIGHTS IS BOTH PHILOSOPHICALLY UNTENABLE AND AN INVITATION TO AN ORGY OF LITIGATION AND LEGAL CONFUSION
474c020u CONGRESS SHOULD REFUSE TO GRANT ARTISTS SPECIAL RIGHTS AND SHOULD REFUSE TO SIGN THE BERN CONVENTION
474c020v THEY CLASSIFIED EVERYTHING I HAD TO SAY AS RACIST OR SEXIST SAYS MR. SCHAUB <NOISE>

474c020z SOME ECONOMISTS SAY INFLATIONARY PRESSURES COULD CONTINUE TO PUSH UP U. S. INTEREST RATES THIS YEAR
474c0210 IF SO FOREIGN CENTRAL BANKS MAY SEE THAT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO TIGHTEN AND TO ADDRESS THEIR OWN INFLATION WORRIES DESPITE U. S. CONCERN
474c0211 ONE FEAR SAYS IRVING TRUST ECONOMIST ROBERT MCGEE IS THAT HIGHER GLOBAL RATES WILL SEND THE FINANCIAL MARKETS INTO A TAILSPIN
474c0212 BY CONTRACTING OUT PRODUCTION TO AMERICAN PLANTS THEY ARE SAVING MORE THAN A DIME PER CAN OF DRINK
474c0213 THEIR NEXT LOGICAL STEP ANALYSTS SAY WILL BE TO ACQUIRE U. S. SOFT DRINK CONCERNS
474c0214 EVENTUALLY THEY MIGHT EVEN BREAK INTO THE ENORMOUS U. S. MARKET
474c0215 AND IT DOESN'T APPEAR THAT CABLE OWNERS WILL RESIST THE CHANGE
474c0216 A SPOKESMAN FOR THE NATIONAL CABLE TELEVISION ASSOCIATION SAID WE DON'T OPPOSE THE PROPOSAL IN PRINCIPLE
474c0217 WE TAKE THE POSITION THAT THE MORE PEOPLE IN THE CABLE MARKET THE BETTER
474c0218 THE PLOT IS A TRUE LIFE TALE OF M. C. A. ITSELF AND THE ENDING HAS YET TO BE PLAYED OUT
474c0219 BUT THE REVELATIONS HAVE ALREADY RAISED EYEBROWS IN HOLLYWOOD WHERE M. C. A. IS CONSIDERED PART OF THE BEDROCK OF THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY
474c021a M. C. A. HAD TWO POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN REVENUE LAST YEAR OWNS UNIVERSAL STUDIOS AND IS A TELEVISION MUSIC AND REAL ESTATE GIANT
474c021b THE COMPANY HASN'T BEEN CHARGED WITH ANY WRONGDOING BUT RECENT PUBLICITY ABOUT ITS TANGLE OF BUSINESS DEALINGS THREATENS AT THE VERY LEAST TO SULLY ITS REPUTATION
474c021c EDUCATION IS THE OPPORTUNITY THROUGH STUDYING A VARIETY OF SUBJECTS TO GAIN INFORMATION AND THE DEXTERITY TO USE YOUR WITS AND YOUR EXPRESSION
474c021d EDUCATION PREPARES YOU TO BE SOMEONE MORE THAN TO DO SOMETHING
474c021e EDUCATION IS WHAT PREPARES YOU TO HEAR MORE WHEN YOU LISTEN TO REACH DEEPER WHEN YOU THINK TO SAY MORE WHEN YOU SPEAK
474c0301 MOST UNUSUALLY THIS TIME AROUND THE CYCLICAL CLIMB IN PLANT USAGE HASN'T YET OCCURRED
474c0302 AS THE EXPANSION KEEPS ROLLING HOWEVER THIS IS EXPECTED TO COME
474c0303 WHEN IT DOES FORECASTERS LOOK FOR BRISKER CAPITAL SPENDING AS WELL REGARDLESS OF THE NEW TAX RULES
474c0304 IT'S A SAD DAY FOR WALL STREET SAID A FIRST BOSTON CORPORATION SPOKESMAN
474c0305 STOCK TRADERS CAUTIONED THAT THE GOVERNMENT HASN'T YET WON CONVICTIONS ON ITS LATEST CASES
474c0306 BUT BOTH LAWMAKERS AND STOCK MARKET PROFESSIONALS SAID YESTERDAY'S ARRESTS SEND A CLEAR SIGNAL AN OVERHAUL OF TAKEOVER AND SECURITIES PRACTICES HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY LIKELY
474c0307 THE SINGAPORE ECONOMY AFTER ITS FIRST DOWNTURN IN NEARLY TWO DECADES OF DOUBLE DIGIT GROWTH IS ON THE ROAD TO RECOVERY ANALYSTS SAY
474c0308 AFTER CONTRACTING ONE POINT EIGHT PERCENT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE THE ISLAND'S GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT GREW ONE POINT NINE PERCENT LAST YEAR ACCORDING TO THE GOVERNMENT'S INITIAL ESTIMATES
474c0309 EXPANSION OF THREE PERCENT TO FOUR PERCENT IS PREDICTED FOR THIS YEAR
474c030a THIS YEAR THE SAME FORCES ARE AT WORK
474c030b I BELIEVE THE CHANCES OF A REPEAT OF LAST YEAR'S PERFORMANCE ARE HIGH SAYS WILLIAM STERLING A MERRILL LYNCH ECONOMIST IN TOKYO
474c030c HE EXPECTS TO SEE ONLY ABOUT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS OF ADDITIONAL SPENDING NOT THE THIRTY SIX BILLION DOLLARS THAT MR. NAKASONE IS TALKING ABOUT
474c030d HER HUSBAND CARL IS A PENNSYLVANIA STATE TROOPER
474c030e TO AVOID ANY CONFLICT OVER SALARIES THEY PUT HER FORTY SIX THOUSAND DOLLAR INCOME IN A SAVINGS ACCOUNT AND LIVE OFF HIS THIRTY ONE THOUSAND DOLLAR INCOME
474c030f I LOOK AT IT AS SEVENTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT WE MADE TOGETHER SAYS MR. STEPHENS
474c030g BAD MANAGEMENT MAY BE COMMON ENOUGH IN AMERICAN BUSINESS BUT THE RISKS PRESENTED BY BADLY RUN NUCLEAR PLANTS ARE FRIGHTENING
474c030h NO LEVEL OF TECHNICAL SAFEGUARDS CAN MAKE A NUCLEAR FACILITY SAFE UNLESS IT HAS GOOD MANAGEMENT THE N. R. C. TOLD CONGRESS LAST YEAR <NOISE>
474c030i INDEED THE AGENCY RECENTLY HAS BEGUN TO CLOSE PLANTS BECAUSE OF MANAGEMENT NOT JUST MECHANICAL SHORTCOMINGS
474c030j IN APRIL FOR INSTANCE THE AGENCY ORDERED PHILADELPHIA ELECTRIC COMPANY TO TURN OFF ITS PEACH BOTTOM PLANT AFTER INSPECTORS FOUND OPERATORS ASLEEP AT THE CONTROLS
474c030k UNFAIR OR NOT THE QUESTIONS ARE BEING ASKED ABOUT BOTH THE REVOLUTION'S ROUTE AND ITS GOALS HOW MUCH VIOLENCE WILL THERE BE
474c030l WILL WHITES HAVE POLITICAL RIGHTS
474c030m HOW MANY WHITES WILL LOSE THEIR JOBS
474c030n HOW COMMUNIST IS THE A. N. C.
474c030o HOW MUCH WILL THE GOVERNMENT CONTROL THE ECONOMY
474c030p ARE THE DANES SUPPOSED TO LISTEN SERIOUSLY TO SECRETARY SHULTZ WHEN HE TELLS THEM THAT THE PROPOSED DANISH POLICY TOWARD SHIPS UNDERCUTS THE NUCLEAR DETERRENCE OF NATO
474c030q WASN'T MR. SHULTZ JUST IN MOSCOW WORKING ON YET ANOTHER NUCLEAR TREATY
474c030r HAVEN'T AMERICAN DIPLOMATS AT NATO BEEN TELLING EVERYONE THAT COMPARED WITH THE POLITICAL EFFECTS OF NOT RATIFYING THE TREATY THE POLITICAL EFFECTS OF RATIFICATION WOULD BE MINIMAL
474c030s MANY FUND MANAGERS HERE SAY AMERICA ISN'T TAKING THE STRONG MEDICINE NEEDED TO CURB HIGH CONSUMER SPENDING IMPROVE LOW PERSONAL SAVINGS RATES AND COMBAT THE STUBBORN DUAL OF DEFICITS
474c030t THEY DON'T EXPECT ANY PROGRESS BEFORE THE NEW U. S. PRESIDENT TAKES OFFICE NEXT YEAR AND SAY BOTH INFLATION AND INTEREST RATES PROBABLY WILL RISE
474c030u THIS WOULD INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF A NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE RECESSION
474c030v MR. KAVNER SAID THE RIVAL GROUP LACKS A CLEAR PROCESS FOR RESOLVING DIFFERENCES
474c030w IN ADDITION HE SAID A. T. AND T. SPENDS FAR MORE EACH YEAR ON DEVELOPING UNIX THAN THE OPEN SOFTWARE FOUNDATION HAS INDICATED IT WILL SPEND <NOISE>
474c030x HE ADDED THAT A. T. AND T. PLANS TO INCORPORATE INTO ITS UNIX ANY USEFUL FEATURES FROM ITS RIVALS' VERSION
474c030y AND MR. WATT IS ECSTATIC
474c030z YOU CAN TEACH WHOLE HISTORY LESSONS FROM THIS VILLAGE INCLUDING ARCHITECTURE SOCIOLOGY AND ART HE SAYS
474c0310 THESE WEALTHY LANDLORDS GOT BIGGER AND MORE POWERFUL AND THAT LED TO THE BREAKDOWN OF THE HAN EMPIRE
474c0311 THE OWNERS BECAME POWERFUL LORDS AND THE GUARDS IN THE TOWERS BECAME PRIVATE ARMIES
474c0312 RICK BRIGGS PRESIDENT OF THE UNION SAID FALCONBRIDGE'S LATEST PROPOSALS ON CONTRACTING OUT ARE NOT ENCOURAGING
474c0313 THE PROPOSALS WERE PRESENTED YESTERDAY AFTER A TWO DAY RECESS IN THE TALKS

474c0401 THEY HAVE PUT IN A LOT OF MONEY BUT IS THAT ENOUGH
474c0402 NOBODY KNOWS SAID MR. BRAY
474c0403 IN OCTOBER WE THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE ENOUGH BUT BETWEEN OCTOBER AND NOW IT'S PROVEN TO BE NOT ENOUGH
474c0404 WHO KNOWS HOW MUCH IT WILL BE

474c0406 ADDED REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN DONNELLY DEMOCRAT MASSACHUSETTS ON THE SPEAKER'S REMARKS IT COMES AS NO SURPRISE
474c0407 HE FEELS STRONGLY THAT OUR TRADING PARTNERS WON'T TAKE US SERIOUSLY UNLESS HIT OVER THE HEAD WITH A PROVISION LIKE GEPHARDT
474c0408 ENERGY EXPERTS CONSIDER AMOCO AND EXXON AMONG THE INDUSTRY'S HEALTHIEST COMPANIES FINANCIALLY WITH STRONG CREDIT RATINGS AND LOW DEBT
474c0409 AMOCO'S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHOW IT HAD FOUR HUNDRED FORTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN CASH AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES ON HAND AT THE CLOSE OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
474c040a IN RECENT TALKS WITH ANALYSTS AMOCO OFFICIALS HAVE SAID THE COMPANY IS WELL POSITIONED FINANCIALLY IF IT DECIDES TO MAKE AN ACQUISITION
474c040b IF THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION IS COMPLETED COCA COLA WILL BE LEFT WITH HUGE BORROWING CAPACITY

474c040h THE FORECAST IS A BIT ROSIER THAN THAT OF MOST PRIVATE ANALYSTS
474c040i IN ITS LATEST SURVEY BLUE CHIP ECONOMIC INDICATORS CONSENSUS FORECAST PUTS GROWTH AT ONE POINT EIGHT PERCENT THIS YEAR
474c040j MORE THAN THREE FOURTHS OF THE ECONOMISTS POLLED EXPECT A RECESSION TO START BEFORE THE END OF NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE

474c040l EXEMPTIONS INCLUDE SINGLE MOTHERS THE HANDICAPPED AND THOSE OVER SIXTY FIVE YEARS OLD
474c040m OTHER EXCEPTIONS INCLUDE FUNDS SET ASIDE FOR HOUSING AND PENSIONS
474c040n THE POINT A POINT MR. CAMPBELL KEEPS RETURNING TO IS THAT EVERY RELIGION IS TRUE
474c040o IT'S TRUE AS A METAPHOR FOR THE HUMAN AND COSMIC MYSTERIES
474c040p IT'S ONLY WHEN YOU'RE STUCK ON THE METAPHOR THAT YOU GET IN TROUBLE

474c040r IN MANY CASES THE BANKS HE ADVISED INVESTED LARGE AMOUNTS IN EACH OTHER

474c0410 WE'VE ALWAYS WONDERED HOW TO SQUARE NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA'S ROUGH WORDS WITH HIS SOFT TREATMENT IN THE DEMOCRATIC CONTROLLED U. S. CONGRESS
474c0411 MAYBE HE HAS TOO BECAUSE HE'S UPPED THE ANTE
474c0412 HE HAS NOW BRANDED NOT ONLY THE REPUBLICANS BUT ALSO THE DEMOCRATS AS IMPERIALISTS BECAUSE BOTH PARTIES HAVE TALKED RECENTLY ABOUT HELPING THE CONTRAS
474c0413 WHAT DO THE DEMOCRATS BECOME IF THEY ACTUALLY VOTE THE BANDAGES

475c0208 SHUTTLE FLIGHTS DEPART ON THE HOUR THE NEW SERVICE WILL OPERATE ON THE HALF HOUR
475c0209 MR. GITTIS SAID THE LAWSUITS WOULD HAVE LITTLE INFLUENCE ON THE RESPONSE OF REVLON'S BOARD TO THE TENDER OFFER
475c020a <NOISE> HE SAID MACANDREWS AND FORBES RATHER THAN REVLON IS BORROWING THE MONEY NEEDED TO ACQUIRE REVLON AND TAKE IT PRIVATE
475c020b WE'RE SELLING EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF NOTES IN A PRIVATE PLACEMENT HE SAID
475c020c IF WE WERE USING REVLON ASSETS THE SUITS COULD BE TROUBLESOME
475c020d <NOISE> STILL MR. JOSEPHS AND OTHERS THINK THAT THE CHANGES WILL BE GOOD FOR THE FARM ECONOMY IN GENERAL
475c020e <NOISE> MANY OF THESE GENTLEMEN FARMERS WERE TAX MOTIVATED NOT PROFIT DRIVEN HE SAYS <NOISE>
475c020f SOME ARE UNFAIR COMPETITION AGAINST THE REGULAR FARMER WHO'S TRYING TO MAKE A BUCK
475c020g ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO SOUTHLAND ACKNOWLEDGED THAT IT WAS CONSIDERING RESTRUCTURING ALTERNATIVES BUT WOULDN'T ELABORATE
475c020h THE OWNER AND OPERATOR OF EIGHT THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED SEVEN ELEVEN STORES REPEATEDLY HAS SAID IT DIDN'T KNOW OF REASONS FOR THE HEAVY TRADING IN ITS STOCK
475c020i <NOISE> BUT STOCK TRADERS CONTINUED TO EXPECT SOUTHLAND TO TAKE SOME ACTION <NOISE> EVEN WHILE SEVERAL ANALYSTS AND INDUSTRY EXECUTIVES SAID THEY BELIEVED SOUTHLAND AND WOULDN'T RESPOND UNLESS A HOSTILE BIDDER EMERGED
475c020j IN KOREA LABOR CONFLICTS HAVE ADDED HEAT TO THE UNSTABLE POLITICAL SITUATION
475c020k THE NEW UNIONS ARE GROWING MORE ADVERSARIAL
475c020l <NOISE> COMPANIES KEEP ASKING THE GOVERNMENT TO SMASH THE UNIONS
475c020m BUT THE RULING PARTY CAN'T RISK ALIENATING WORKERS WHO WILL VOTE IN THE COMING ELECTIONS
475c020n IT REFUSES SO FAR TO BACKTRACK ON ITS JULY ONE PROMISE OF GREATER DEMOCRACY OR TO RETURN TO THE POLICY OF OVERT UNION BUSTING
475c020o <NOISE> WORLDS OF WONDER NEEDS TO CONVINCE CREDITORS TO EXTEND IT TIME THROUGH THE CHRISTMAS SEASON WHICH IS BY FAR THE BIGGEST SALES PERIOD FOR TOY COMPANIES
475c020p IT'S IN THE CREDITORS' BEST INTEREST TO KEEP THE COMPANY GOING AT LEAST FOR NOW SAID FRED ANSCHEL THE ANALYST WITH DEAN WITTER REYNOLDS INC.
475c020q AS OF SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH THE COMPANY'S INVENTORY WAS A HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS A SPOKESWOMAN SAID
475c020r CONGRESS'S JOINT TAX COMMITTEE NOW IS WITHOUT A STAFF CHIEF
475c020s <NOISE> DAVID BROCKWAY HAS LEFT AS PLANNED TO JOIN THE WASHINGTON LAW OFFICE OF DEWEY BALLANTINE BUSHBY PALMER AND WOOD
475c020t SUCCESSOR HASN'T BEEN NAMED
475c020u BANKAMERICA IS NOW WRITING OFF FEWER OF ITS PROBLEM LOANS THAN MOST OTHER LARGE BANKS
475c020v THE DEVELOPMENT HAS LEFT SOME ANALYSTS WONDERING WHETHER THE BANK IS BEING AGGRESSIVE ENOUGH ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING ITS RECORD OF SURPRISING LOAN PROBLEMS OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS
475c020w BUT BANK OFFICIALS SAID THEY ARE BEING PRUDENT
475c020x THEY SAID LOWER WRITE OFFS REFLECT PREVIOUS HOUSECLEANING AS WELL AS MORE CONSERVATIVE LENDING PRACTICES
475c020y <NOISE> IN ADDITION THE BANK HAS A BEEFED UP TEAM OF SPECIALISTS WHO ARE HAVING INCREASING SUCCESS IN RECOVERING PREVIOUSLY WRITTEN OFF LOANS
475c020z THE ONLY NEW ISSUE PRICED YESTERDAY WAS FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION OF A TWELVE YEAR SENIOR SUBORDINATED DEBENTURE FROM U. S. G. CORPORATION
475c0210 THE HIGH RISK HIGH YIELD ISSUE WAS PRICED AT PAR TO YIELD THIRTEEN AND A QUARTER PERCENT BY SALOMON BROTHERS INC. AND GOLDMAN SACHS AND COMPANY
475c0211 THE OFFERING IS PART OF U. S. G.'S RECAPITALIZATION PLAN
475c0212 MR. ZEHNDER PLAYS DOWN THIS CRITICISM
475c0213 <NOISE> HE POINTS TO THE FACT THAT CREDIT SUISSE LEADS IN THE NUMBER OF PUBLICLY LISTED BONDS LAUNCHED BUT LAGS IN THE NUMBER OF UNLISTED NOTES IT ISSUED
475c0214 THIS IS SIGNIFICANT HE SAYS BECAUSE BOND ISSUES PAY HIGHER COMMISSIONS THAN UNLISTED NOTES
475c0215 IN CONTRAST SENATOR BENTSEN CAMPAIGNED LAST WEEK IN A HALF EMPTY PLANE TO A MEASURED CADENCE
475c0216 HE PORTRAYS GOVERNOR DUKAKIS AS A PRAGMATIC CAN DO EXECUTIVE
475c0217 <NOISE> AND HE OFFERS HIMSELF A BUSINESS ORIENTED SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN AND FORMER INSURANCE EXECUTIVE <NOISE> AS EVIDENCE OF THAT MODERATION
475c0218 THE RECURRING WORDS OF HIS SPEECHES ARE THE WORDS OF THE BOARDROOM COMPETENCE HANDS ON MANAGEMENT ENHANCED RECOVERY
475c0219 <NOISE> MR. KIDDER INSISTS THERE IS CAUSE FOR HOPE
475c021a GOOD TEACHERS PUT SNAGS IN THE RIVER OF CHILDREN PASSING BY <NOISE> AND OVER THE YEARS THEY REDIRECT HUNDREDS OF LIVES
475c021b PERHAPS HE IS RIGHT <NOISE>
475c021c BUT WHAT HE NOTICES AT THE FIFTH GRADE SCIENCE FAIR SEEMS MORE SIGNIFICANT
475c021d THE RESULTS OF THAT PAINFUL CHARADE DON'T REFLECT SOCIAL STATUS ETHNIC BACKGROUND OR TEACHING TECHNIQUE THEY REFLECT THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF EACH CHILD'S PARENTS
475c021e AVIATION INSURANCE IS UNDER INTENSE PRESSURE
475c021f THE GLOBAL AIRLINE PREMIUMS HAVE DROPPED TO ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FROM ABOUT ONE BILLION IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
475c021g MEANWHILE AIRLINE LOSSES IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT ROSE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE PREVIOUS YEAR
475c0301 <NOISE> THE ECONOMIC FALLOUT SHOULDN'T BE IGNORED HOWEVER
475c0302 A PROVISION IN THE SPENDING BILL REQUIRES THAT AT LEAST ONE THIRD OF THE REPAIR AND OVERHAUL WORK ON SHIPS BE DONE LOCALLY AT THEIR HOME PORTS
475c0303 THAT MAKES IT A BIG DEAL FOR TODD AND LOCKHEED MR. DICKS SAYS REFERRING TO TWO PUGET SOUND SHIPYARDS
475c0304 THE GOVERNMENT CIVIL SUIT ALLEGED THAT A DEFECT COULD CAUSE THE REAR BRAKES TO LOCK SENDING THE CAR SPINNING OUT OF CONTROL
475c0305 G. M. WHICH NO LONGER MAKES THE X. CARS DENIED THAT THE BRAKES ARE DEFECTIVE
475c0306 AGREEING WITH G. M. JUDGE JACKSON RULED THAT THE GOVERNMENT CAME TO COURT WITH NOTHING MORE ESSENTIALLY THAN A REASONABLE SUSPICION THAT A DEFECT EXISTED
475c0307 INCO'S STOCK HAS CAUGHT TECHNICAL ANALYSTS' ATTENTION TOO
475c0308 IT RECENTLY BROKE OUT OF A FIVE YEAR TRADING RANGE SAYS MARTIN PRING EDITOR OF PRING MARKET REVIEW
475c0309 <NOISE> HE THINKS THE STOCK COULD BE POISED FOR BIG GAINS REFLECTING WHAT MAY BE A BULL MARKET IN BASE METALS
475c030a RENT CONTROL IS AS BAD AS THE INCOME TAX DEDUCTION FOR HOME OWNERSHIP
475c030b ALL THE BENEFICIARIES OF THE DEDUCTION ARE HIGH INCOME EARNERS NOT SIMPLY SOME OF THEM
475c030c IT LEADS TO EXTRA LARGE SWIMMING POOLS EXTRA BEDROOMS IN BEVERLY HILLS BUT NO HOUSING FOR THE PEOPLE WHO NEED IT MOST
475c030d STILL WHEN THIS ISSUE WAS LAST VOTED ON IN CONGRESS EIGHTY FIVE OUT OF EIGHTY FIVE SENATORS PRESENT VOTED FOR IT
475c030e THE ONLY SURPRISING THING GIVEN THE NUMBER OF BENEFICIARIES IS THAT SOMEHOW THE OTHER FIFTEEN SENATORS DIDN'T MANAGE TO GET THEIR NAMES ON THE ROLL CALL
475c030f MR. ZINN SAID ENTERTAINMENT MARKETING IS STILL WEIGHING A PROXY FIGHT
475c030g IT'S A BAD FEELING IN YOUR STOMACH WHEN THE CHAIRMAN AND PREVIOUS BIDDER IS SELLING HIS BLOCK HE SAID
475c030h IT DOESN'T MAKE ME AS A SHAREHOLDER COMFORTABLE WITH WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE COMPANY
475c030i UNDER THE PLAN THE EDELMAN GROUP WOULD CONTRIBUTE ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN EQUITY TO THE TRANSACTION
475c030j THE REMAINDER WOULD BE FINANCED WITH DEBT AND DEBT SECURITIES
475c030k IF THE PLAN SUCCEEDS SHEARSON WOULD BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE WARRANTS TO BUY TEN TO TWENTY PERCENT OF THE FULLY DILUTED COMMON EQUITY OF THE COMPANY

475c030m FIDELITY'S PACKERS HE SAYS SPREAD THE PEREZ FAMILY FURNISHINGS IN THE FRONT YARD <NOISE> THEN LEFT FOR AN EXTENDED LUNCH BREAK
475c030n MINUTES LATER THERE WAS A DRENCHING RAIN
475c030o <NOISE> IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR WHEN HE RETURNED MUCH OF THE FURNITURE WAS SOGGY AND MOLDY
475c030p WHILE CHRONICLING THE DOINGS OF THE HIGHFALUTIN MAY SEEM LIGHT STUFF TO SOME MR. REVSON SAYS HIS OWN APPROACH TO THE SUBJECT MATTER ISN'T
475c030q IT ISN'T JUST THROWING TOGETHER A STRING OF NAMES AND SAYING THEY SIPPED CHAMPAGNE ATE CAVIAR AND WORE BILL BLASS THE COLUMNIST SAYS
475c030r FACTS ARE IMPORTANT
475c030s IF YOU SAY SOMEONE IS WEARING A RED TIE THEN HE SHOULD BE WEARING A RED TIE
475c030t GENLYTE DESIGNS AND MAKES LIGHTING FIXTURES AND ELECTRONIC LIGHTING CONTROLS
475c030u OTHER BAIRNCO UNITS MAKE ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS COMPOSITE MATERIALS AND ELECTROMAGNETIC SHIELDING SYSTEMS
475c030v IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN NEW YORK BASED BAIRNCO EARNED TWENTY EIGHT POINT TWO MILLION OR TWO POINT SIXTY EIGHT A SHARE
475c030w THE KING'S REQUEST LEFT THE DELEGATES IN A TIGHT SPOT
475c030x TO IGNORE JORDAN AND MAKE A SUBSTANTIAL FORMAL CASH PLEDGE TO THE P. L. O. WOULD SIGNAL A SHIFT AWAY FROM MODERATION DIFFICULT FOR THE GULF STATES TO COUNTENANCE
475c030y BUT TO FINANCE BOTH JORDAN AND THE P. L. O. RISKED TRIGGERING A CLAMOR FROM OTHER CASH STRAPPED STATES COVERED UNDER THE BAGHDAD AGREEMENT SUCH AS LEBANON AND SYRIA
475c030z BUT OTHER EVIDENCE ON FLAPS IS CONFLICTING
475c0310 ONE OF THE CREW MEMBERS CAN BE HEARD ON THE COCKPIT VOICE RECORDER CALLING OUT FLAPS FIFTEEN FIFTEEN THE CORRECT POSITION FOR THE FLAPS
475c0311 AND THE RECORDER INDICATES THAT A COCKPIT ALARM THAT SHOULD HAVE ALERTED THE CREW TO IMPROPERLY SET FLAPS DIDN'T GO OFF
475c0312 WHEN THE HOUSE AND SENATE APPROVED THE TAX BILL EARLY SATURDAY LAWMAKERS DIDN'T MENTION THE LAST MINUTE PROVISIONS AND CONGRESSIONAL STAFFERS DESCRIBED THEM AS TECHNICAL
475c0313 <NOISE> WHILE THE ESTIMATED REVENUE OF ALMOST A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OVER THREE YEARS IS RELATIVELY SMALL THE PROVISIONS MIGHT BE PERCEIVED AS AN ANTI TAKEOVER PUSH BY CONGRESS
475c0314 THEY COULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF SLOWING CERTAIN TAKEOVER ACTIVITY CONGRESSIONAL SOURCES ACKNOWLEDGED OVER THE WEEKEND
475c0315 TO BE SURE THE DEFICIT HAS DECLINED IN THE PAST FEW YEARS
475c0316 BUT THAT DECLINE IS ENTIRELY THE RESULT OF A RISING SURPLUS IN THE SOCIAL SECURITY TRUST FUND
475c0317 THAT MONEY SHOULD BE INVESTED TO HELP DEFRAY THE FUTURE RETIREMENT COSTS OF THE BABY BOOMERS <NOISE> INSTEAD IT IS BEING USED TO PAPER OVER THE DEFICIT
475c0318 <NOISE> THAT'S YET ANOTHER SYMPTOM OF MR. DARMAN'S NATIONAL NOW NOW ISM
475c0319 <NOISE> THIS YEAR THE SOVIETS HAVE MOVED COMMERCIAL SALES TO THE FRONT BURNER
475c031a EXPORT ARM OF THE SOVIET MINISTRY OF AVIATION INDUSTRY HOPES TO DOUBLE ITS REVENUE BY THE MID NINETEEN NINETIES
475c031b BUT SUCH A SHIFT WOULD BRING MAJOR UPHEAVALS TO THE SOVIET SYSTEM
475c031c ORDERS FOR MILITARY AIRCRAFT HAVE FALLEN TWENTY PERCENT IN THE PAST TWO YEARS ACCORDING TO SOME ESTIMATES
475c031d <NOISE> AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN DECADES PRESTIGIOUS MILITARY DESIGN BUREAUS IN THE SOVIET UNION ARE DEVOTING SUBSTANTIAL MANPOWER TO CIVILIAN PROJECTS
475c031e ASHTON TATE HAS BEEN PLAGUED BY OPERATING LOSSES AND MANAGEMENT TURMOIL
475c031f LAST MONTH IT REPORTED A NINETEEN POINT EIGHT MILLION <NOISE> SECOND QUARTER NET LOSS AS WELL AS THE RESIGNATION OF ITS PRESIDENT AND CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER
475c031g ONCE A SOFTWARE INDUSTRY STAR THE COMPANY HAS BEEN BUFFETED BY GROWING COMPETITION IN ITS CORE DATABASE BUSINESS
475c0401 <NOISE> LAST WEEK THERE WERE REPORTS THAT AFTER THE OFFERING SHEARSON LEHMAN HAD A BIG UNSOLD CHUNK OF STOCK
475c0402 <NOISE> IN A NARROWLY DRAWN STATEMENT VICE CHAIRMAN HERBERT FREIMAN DENIED SHEARSON HAD OFFERED A BLOCK TO SALOMON BROTHERS <NOISE> WHICH MANAGED THE SELLING BROKERS' FLOOR OPERATION
475c0403 MR. FREIMAN WOULDN'T ELABORATE
475c0404 THAT MAY BE BUT THERE ARE TOUGH CALLS
475c0405 EMOTIONAL UPSET HEADACHES BACKACHES AND OTHER SUBJECTIVE SYMPTOMS ARE HARD TO QUANTIFY
475c0406 BESIDES SOMEONE WHO TRULY FEELS DISABLED MAY AS A RESULT ACTUALLY BE DISABLED
475c0407 <NOISE> A WELL TIMED PERIOD OF TIME OFF WITH STRESS REDUCTION AND AN EFFORT AT BETTER UNDERSTANDING MAY PREVENT A MUCH WORSE DISABILITY LATER
475c0408 IT MAY ALSO UNCOVER FACTORS AT THE WORKPLACE THAT CAN BE IMPROVED
475c0409 I TRY TO GIVE THE PATIENT THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT WITHIN REASON
475c040a NOT DOING SO IS MORE THAN UNKIND IT RISKS HARM TO THE PATIENT AND LAWSUITS THAT NEITHER THE PHYSICIAN NOR EMPLOYER WOULD WELCOME
475c040b <NOISE> BUT SOME FIND ELECTRONIC INVESTING ISN'T WORTH THE TROUBLE
475c040c MR. JEFFERS ESTIMATES THAT A THIRD OF INVESTMENT SOFTWARE BUYERS EVENTUALLY JUNK THEIR PURCHASES BECAUSE THE TECHNOLOGY BAFFLES THEM
475c040d AND WHILE SOME INVESTORS SAY COMPUTERS HAVE MADE THEM MONEY OTHERS HAVE SQUANDERED SMALL FORTUNES BECAUSE THEY RELIED TOO HEAVILY ON TECHNOLOGY
475c040e BANKERS SAY CHILE MEXICO AND THE PHILIPPINES HAVE ACCOUNTED FOR MOST OF THE ESTIMATED SIX BILLION DOLLARS OF DEBT EQUITY SWAPS TO DATE
475c040f SOME BANKERS HAVE ESTIMATED THAT THE TOTAL MAY RISE AS HIGH AS TEN BILLION THIS YEAR
475c040g SUCH SWAPS ONLY BEGAN ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO
475c040h THE UTILITY WILL BEGIN PAYING INTEREST IN CASH AFTER SEABROOK GOES INTO SERVICE MR. BAYLESS SAID
475c040i MR. HARRISON SAID THE COMPANY DOESN'T KNOW HOW LONG IT WILL TAKE TO LEAP THE POLITICAL HURDLES THAT ARE BLOCKING SEABROOK
475c040j BUT THE FINANCIAL RESTRUCTURING IS INTENDED TO KEEP THE COMPANY GOING WITHOUT ADDITIONAL BORROWING UNTIL NINETEEN NINETY OR NINETEEN NINETY ONE HE SAID
475c040k JUDGE BORK HOWEVER ASKED FOR NONE OF THIS
475c040l BORK DOESN'T WANT A POLITICAL CAMPAIGN MR. GARMENT CONCEDES
475c040m I TOLD HIM I WOULD DO THIS UNLESS HE VIOLENTLY OBJECTED
475c040n HE SAID YOU'RE A FREE AGENT GARMENT
475c040o DO WHAT YOU THINK IS APPROPRIATE
475c040p THE HUGE GAP TO A LARGE EXTENT IS A PRICE PHENOMENON
475c040q THE DOLLAR'S FALL HAS PUSHED UP THE PRICE OF IMPORTS CAUSING THE DEFICIT TO SWELL EVEN AS THE VOLUME OF NON OIL IMPORTS HAS RECEDED
475c040r BUT LONG BEFORE NOW THESE HIGHER PRICES WERE SUPPOSED TO LEAD TO IMPROVEMENT IN THE MONTHLY MERCHANDISE TRADE DEFICIT AS WELL
475c040s OCTOBER THIRTY ONE WASTE MANAGEMENT'S BOARD MEETS
475c040t CHEMLAWN IS DISCUSSED ONLY BRIEFLY AND IT IS RULED OUT AS A TAKEOVER TARGET BY MR. BUNTROCK

475c040v <NOISE> I DON'T KNOW IF JESSE JACKSON EVER DREAMED OF BEING PRESIDENT WHILE GROWING UP POOR AND BLACK IN SOUTH CAROLINA
475c040w I DO KNOW HE NEVER DREAMED IT WOULD BE EASY OR QUICK
475c040x I HOPE MR. JACKSON WILL FORGIVE ME IF I ASSUME THAT HE IS WILLING TO WAIT ANOTHER EIGHT WHILE KEEPING HIS EYES ON THE PRIZE
475c040y SOUTHWESTERN BELL HAS THIRTY DAYS TO CONTEST THE COMPLAINT
475c040z THE COMMISSION IS EXPECTED TO ISSUE A FINAL DECISION BY THE END OF THE YEAR
475c0410 GENERALLY THOUGH THE AGENCY'S STAFF IS VIEWED AS AGGRESSIVE IN ITS RECOMMENDATIONS THE COMMISSION HAS USUALLY APPROVED FAR MORE MODEST CUTS FOR REGULATED COMPANIES
475c0411 WE HAVE FREEDOM IN THIS COUNTRY BUT IT STINKS SAYS ELEVEN YEAR OLD SEAN HOOKS
475c0412 <NOISE> DRUGS ALCOHOL CRIME
475c0413 THERE'S NO GOOD NEWS ANYMORE
475c0414 I'M HOPING WE GET A PRESIDENT WHO CLEANS OUT AMERICA
475c0415 DANIEL J. GILMARTIN WAS NAMED PRESIDENT AND CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER OF FRANK'S NURSERY AND CRAFTS DETROIT A UNIT OF THIS SPECIALTY RETAILER
475c0416 THE POSTS HAD BEEN VACANT SINCE EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
475c0417 MR. GILMARTIN HAD BEEN DIRECTOR CORPORATE PLANNING FOR THE PARENT COMPANY
475c0418 THEN IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR NATIONAL UNION JOINED THE MARKET
475c0419 <NOISE> ITS POLICY FOR STATE JUDGES THE BIGGEST CLIENTS COST EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR FOR A ONE MILLION DOLLAR POLICY WITH NO DEDUCTIBLE
475c041a THE JUDGES ARE COVERED FOR ACTS ERRORS OR OMISSIONS IN THE PERFORMANCE OF PROFESSIONAL DUTIES MR. BOLEN SAYS
476c0201 MORE TRADITIONAL ACADEMICS SAY THAT MANY OF THE NEWER JOURNALS ARE MERELY PLATFORMS FOR MARGINAL SCHOLARS TO WRITE ON TRIVIAL TOPICS
476c0202 I'M DIMLY AWARE THAT THEY'RE OUT THERE SAYS RICHARD ULLMAN PROFESSOR OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS AT PRINCETON UNIVERSITY <NOISE> AND A FORMER EDITOR OF FOREIGN POLICY MAGAZINE
476c0203 <NOISE> BUT I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT PEOPLE WHO PUBLISH SOMETHING THAT'S IMPORTANT WOULDN'T WANT TO PUBLISH IN THE LEADING JOURNALS
476c0204 <NOISE> THE UTILITY WILL BEGIN PAYING INTEREST IN CASH AFTER SEABROOK GOES INTO SERVICE MR. BAYLESS SAID
476c0205 MR. HARRISON SAID THE COMPANY DOESN'T KNOW HOW LONG IT WILL TAKE TO LEAP THE POLITICAL HURDLES THAT ARE BLOCKING SEABROOK
476c0206 BUT THE FINANCIAL RESTRUCTURING IS INTENDED TO KEEP THE COMPANY GOING WITHOUT ADDITIONAL BORROWING UNTIL NINETEEN NINETY OR NINETY ONE HE SAID
476c0207 <NOISE> ANALYSTS ALSO SAID THEY HADN'T EXPECTED LOWER OPERATING PROFITS FOR THE COMPANY'S INDUSTRIES GROUP AND FOR THE BROADCASTING SEGMENT
476c0208 WESTINGHOUSE OFFICIALS TOLD ANALYSTS THAT OPERATING PROFIT IN THE INDUSTRIES GROUP FELL FIFTEEN TO TWENTY PERCENT HURT IN PART BY WEAK RESULTS IN CANADIAN OPERATIONS
476c0209 A SHARP DROP IN OPERATING PROFIT FROM THE BROADCASTING GROUP'S PRODUCTION COMPANY CONTRIBUTED TO THE SLIGHTLY LOWER OPERATING EARNINGS OVERALL FOR THAT SEGMENT
476c020a KEMP'S CAMPAIGN TAKES ON AN INCREASINGLY DESPERATE TONE
476c020b IN ONE SURE SIGN OF A CANDIDACY IN TROUBLE HE LASHES OUT AT CRITICISM FROM A HIGHLY REGARDED T. V. COMMENTATOR
476c020c EVEN SOME SUPPORTERS NOW SAY PRIVATELY THAT HE SHOULD AIM FOR THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION
476c020d BUT HIS LONGTIME HOSTILITIES WITH DOLE LEAVE A SPOT ON A BUSH TICKET AS ABOUT THE ONLY POSSIBILITY
476c020e THOSE LANDS HAVE BECOME WORTH MUCH MORE THAN THE TRANSPORTATION AND ENERGY CONCERN NEEDS FOR THE RAILROAD <NOISE> AND THE COMPANY HAD BEEN TRYING TO FREE ITSELF FROM THE LIENS
476c020f LAST SPRING BURLINGTON AGREED TO PAY REMAINING BONDHOLDERS A TOTAL <NOISE> OF THIRTY FIVE POINT FIVE <NOISE> MILLION DOLLARS IN RETURN FOR PERMISSION TO REMOVE THE COVENANTS
476c020g A JUDGE R- APPROVED THE AGREEMENT IN NOVEMBER AND IT BECAME FINAL JANUARY TWELFTH

476c020i ON A PER TON BASIS PRETAX PROFIT DOUBLED TO ABOUT THIRTY SIX DOLLARS FROM EIGHTEEN DOLLARS IN THE THIRD QUARTER
476c020j <NOISE> HOWEVER THE PERFORMANCE FELL FAR SHORT OF U. S. X. CHAIRMAN DAVID RODERICK'S PREDICTION <NOISE> OF FIFTY DOLLARS PLUS PER TON PROFIT
476c020k TEXAS OF COURSE IS WHERE THE MOST TROUBLE IS TO BE FOUND
476c020l LENDERS THERE LIKE TO BLAME THE SO CALLED OIL PATCH RECESSION
476c020m <NOISE> BUT THE PROBLEM IN FACT IS BAD BANKING IN A FEW CASES EVEN CORRUPT BANKING
476c020n SOME PARTS OF TEXAS THE DALLAS FORT
476c020o WORTH AREA FOR EXAMPLE HAVEN'T HAD ANYTHING THAT LEGITIMATELY COULD BE CALLED A RECESSION
476c020p THE MAIN REASON SO MANY LENDERS ARE IN TROUBLE IS AN OLD FASHIONED FAILING AMONG BANKERS A WEAKNESS FOR REAL ESTATE SPECULATION
476c020q AS A RESULT THE GOVERNMENT IS NOW TALKING OF HIGHER FARM PRICES
476c020r BUT HIGHER FARM PRICES WOULD ADD TO AN ALREADY STEEP INFLATION RATE
476c020s SO BEIJING OFFICIALS REPORTEDLY TALK OF TYING WAGES TO INFLATION <NOISE> AN IDEA REMINISCENT OF THE WAGE INDEXATION TRIED IN SOME LATIN AMERICAN NATIONS SEVERAL YEARS AGO WITH DISASTROUS RESULTS
476c020t SECRETARIES ARE ALSO EASY TARGETS FOR A HUG ESPECIALLY IN HOLLYWOOD

476c020x WE HAVE A GREAT SENSE OF HUMOR HE SAYS
476c020y <NOISE> WE'LL TAKE ALMOST ANYTHING
476c020z BESIDES HE ADDS NEW YORKERS COME HERE ALL THE TIME WE JUST (PARENTHETICALLY WOULDN'T WANT THEM TO LIVE HERE
476c0210 <NOISE> ONE BIG PLAY LAST YEAR WAS LEISURE
476c0211 ANOTHER WAS UNDERVALUED ASSETS EVEN THOUGH NO ONE CAN RECALL A JAPANESE COMPANY BEING BROKEN UP JU(ST)- FOR ITS ASSETS
476c0212 ONCE YOU GET TO THAT THEME THE LEVEL OF THE P. TO E. RATIO DOESN'T MEAN A DAMN SAYS MR. ROBINS
476c0213 IT'S ALL A BIT OF A MIRAGE
476c0214 YET ONE THAT SO FAR HAS WORKED
476c0215 BUT OTHER EVIDENCE ON THE FLAPS IS CONFLICTING
476c0216 ONE OF THE CREW MEMBERS CAN BE HEARD ON THE COCKPIT VOICE RECORDER CALLING OUT FLAPS FIFTEEN FIFTEEN THE CORRECT POSITION FOR THE FLAPS
476c0217 AND THE RECORDER INDICATES THAT A COCKPIT ALARM THAT SHOULD HAVE ALERTED THE CREW TO IMPROPERLY SET FLAPS DIDN'T GO OFF
476c0218 WHAT BOTHERS THESE PEOPLE IS NOT THAT MRS. THATCHER POSES A DANGER TO THE SO CALLED UNIFIED EUROPEAN MARKET
476c0219 MRS. THATCHER IS NOT OPPOSED TO THIS
476c021a BRITAIN'S OWN MARKETS ARE MORE OPEN THAN THOSE OF MOST EUROPEAN COUNTRIES LONDON IS WAY AHEAD OF THEM ON CAPITAL MOVEMENT HAVING ABOLISHED EXCHANGE CONTROLS ALTOGETHER
476c021b THE CAUSE OF THE OUTRAGE IS THAT EUROPEAN UNITY IS THE DEVICE THROUGH WHICH THE REGULATORS AND SOCIALISTS <NOISE> HOPE TO EXPAND THEIR GROUP ON THE CONTINENT
476c021c NOW HIS LAUGHTER IS GONE
476c021d <NOISE> BECAUSE OF DRUGS HE IS DEAD
476c021e AND EVERY DAY MY HEART BREAKS A LITTLE MORE
476c021f <NOISE> ON THE SURFACE THE TRADE REPORT LOOKED ENCOURAGING
476c021g <NOISE> THE NATION'S SEASONALLY ADJUSTED TRADE DEFICIT NARROWED TO EIGHT POINT ONE SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN JUNE THE LOWEST MONTHLY DEFICIT SINCE DECEMBER NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR

476c0301 SO FAR ILLEGAL FOREIGN WORKERS AREN'T TAKEN AS A JOB THREAT BY JAPANESE WORKERS
476c0302 BUT JAPANESE UNEMPLOYMENT IS AT HISTORICALLY HIGH LEVELS BECAUSE OF THE YEN'S STRENGTH <NOISE> POSING A KNOTTY PROBLEM FOR THE GOVERNMENT
476c0303 MANY JAPANESE COMPANIES IN SUCH INDUSTRIES AS STEEL AND SHIPBUILDING ARE CUTTING THEIR LABOR FORCES
476c0304 <NOISE> <NOISE> IN THE PAST FILIPINOS IN MANY RURAL AREAS PREFERRED THE DISCIPLINED TERROR OF THE N. P. A. TO THE RANDOM EXCESSES OF THE COUNTRY'S MILITARY
476c0305 <NOISE> WITH THE CHANGE OF GOVERNMENT LAST YEAR A MILD IMPROVEMENT IN MILITARY BEHAVIOR AND THE DETECTION OF THE MINDANAO SLAUGHTERS SOME FILIPINOS ARE CHANGING THEIR MINDS
476c0306 DIPLOMATS AND POLITICAL ANALYSTS SAY THEY DON'T KNOW IF THE TREND PRESAGES SIGNIFICANT POPULAR RESISTANCE TO THE COMMUNISTS OR JUST ADDITIONAL TURMOIL IN THE PHILIPPINE COUNTRYSIDE
476c0307 <NOISE> THERE IS A WIDE VARIATION IN THINKING ABOUT HOW SICK ONE IS AND HOW IMPORTANT TIME OFF IS IN ORDER TO GET WELL
476c0308 THE PATIENTS' RESPONSIBILITIES OUTSIDE OF WORK ALSO VARY
476c0309 <NOISE> IT'S HARD TO SAY TO WHAT DEGREE THESE FACTORS SHOULD INFLUENCE DISABILITY STATUS
476c030a <NOISE> MOST PHYSICIANS PROBABLY CONSIDER THEM IMPORTANT
476c030b <NOISE> IN CLEVELAND HIGBEE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER ROBERT BROADBENT SAYS THE RETAILER HAS BENEFITED FROM ITS PARENT'S FINANCIAL EXPERTISE
476c030c ALTHOUGH IT WILL RETAIN CONTROL INDUSTRIAL EQUITY IS PLANNING TO TAKE HIGBEE PUBLIC AGAIN PROBABLY IN JUNE
476c030d MEANWHILE SAYS MR. BROADBENT THEY'VE MADE US MORE INQUISITIVE ABOUT ACQUISITIONS OURSELVES
476c030e THE LOAN IS PART OF A SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR PLAN TO EXPAND THE MINE'S RESERVES AND ALLOW IT TO KEEP OPERATING UNTIL NINETEEN NINETY FOUR
476c030f WITHOUT THE EXPANSION THE MINE WAS THREATENED WITH CLOSURE NEXT YEAR
476c030g CLOSURE WOULD MEAN THE LOSS OF SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN JOBS
476c030h ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS ARE CONCERNED BY INTELLIGENCE REPORTS THAT SUGGEST THAT IRAN IS THINKING ABOUT ORGANIZING TERRORIST STRIKES AGAINST A- AMERICAN WEST EUROPEAN AND ARAB TARGETS
476c030i THE ADMINISTRATION HAS ALERTED EMBASSIES AND MILITARY BASES OF AN *INCREASED* THREAT

476c030t BASED ON CURRENT BOOK VALUE THE SUBSIDIARIES WOULD FETCH THIRTY TWO POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN CASH PLUS PREFERRED STOCK IN ONE OF THE UTILITY UNITS

476c0310 WHEN SALES EVENTUALLY SLOWED INVENTORIES QUICKLY REACHED EXCESSIVE LEVELS
476c0311 COMPANIES THEREUPON CUT THEIR BUYING INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION DECLINED <NOISE> AND A RECESSION WAS UNDER WAY
476c0312 THIRTY ONE TEAMS OF NINETEEN REPRESENTING BUSINESSES SCHOOLS AND ASSORTED OTHER GROUPS SIGNED UP FOR THE FIRST LOCAL COMPETITION
476c0313 FOR WEEKS DRUMS WERE HEARD ALONG THE WILLAMETTE AS THE TEAMS PRACTICED
476c0314 BOATS F:ULL OF MEN AND WOMEN IN BUSINESS SUITS FRESH FROM WORK OR HAPPY HOUR <NOISE> WERE NOT AN UNCOMMON SIGHT
476c0315 <NOISE> THESE MIXED FEELINGS OF FRUSTRATION WITH AND GRATITUDE TOWARD THE AUTHORITIES ARE PART OF THE EVERYDAY LIFE OF A FOREIGNER DOING BUSINESS IN KOREA <NOISE>
476c0316 IN FACT SUCH CONTRADICTIONS ARE WHAT SEEM TO MAKE THE KOREAN WORLD GO ROUND
476c0317 <NOISE> A WESTERN BUSINESSMAN NEEDS TO BE READY FOR THEM
476c0318 <NOISE> HERE ARE A FEW HARD EARNED FACTS OF KOREAN BUSINESS LIFE <NOISE>
476c0319 BUT MANY LOCAL BUSINESSES THAT DEPEND UPON TOURISM AREN'T CONVINCED
476c031a <NOISE> THEY ARGUE THAT A COMMERCIAL MINE MIGHT GET PLAYED OUT IN A FEW YEARS
476c031b <NOISE> AND THEY FEAR THAT MANY TOURISTS WHO TREK HERE FOR THE TANTALIZING PROSPECT OF FINDING A DIAMOND IN THE FIELD <NOISE> WILL TAKE THEIR VACATIONS ELSEWHERE
476c0401 <NOISE> THE COURT WAS SPLIT ON BOTH THE WILLIAMS ACT AND THE COMMERCE CLAUSE
476c0402 JUSTICE LEWIS POWELL ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO CASE OF EDGAR V.
476c0403 MITE SUGGESTED THAT ANY STATE LAW THAT FAVORED TARGETS MORE THAN DID THE WILLIAMS ACT <NOISE> WOULD BE INVALID BECAUSE CONGRESS HAD PREEMPTED LOCAL REGULATIONS
476c0404 THE COURT BACKTRACKED HERE TO SAY THAT STATE LAWS MIGHT BE O. K. IF THEY HELP THE WILLIAMS ACT PURPOSE BY HEAPING EVEN MORE BURDENS ON ACQUIRERS
476c0405 <NOISE> IT HAS RELIEVED AT LEAST SOME OF THE FRUSTRATION FELT BY THE FARMERS SAYS PETER BRENT A MEMBER OF A FARM ACTIVIST GROUP
476c0406 IF THEY GO TO MEDIATION AT LEAST THE LENDER HAS TO LISTEN
476c0407 NEARLY A DOZEN OTHER STATES HAVE INQUIRED INTO IOWA'S PROGRAM
476c0408 <NOISE> AND MANDATORY MEDIATION MODELED ON IOWA'S PROGRAM IS CURRENTLY BEING CONSIDERED BY THE CALIFORNIA AND MISSOURI LEGISLATURES
476c0409 <NOISE> OGILVY IS THE NATION'S FIFTH LARGEST ADVERTISING AGENCY <NOISE> WITH NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX BILLINGS OF THREE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS
476c040a ROUGHLY HALF OF THOSE BILLINGS CAME FROM OUTSIDE THE U. S. MR. ROMAN SAID
476c040b <NOISE> AGENCIES TRADITIONALLY HAVE TAKEN FIFTEEN PERCENT OF BILLINGS AS A COMMISSION
476c040c <NOISE> L. T. V. HAS SAID REPEATEDLY SINCE ITS FILING THAT IT WOULD FIGHT ANY CREDITOR MOVE TO EITHER REORGANIZE THE UNIT SEPARATELY OR FORCE ITS SALE
476c040d <NOISE> CREDITORS ON THE OTHER HAND HAVE DISCUSSED THE IDEA ALMOST SINCE THE DAY OF L. T. V.'S FILING
476c040e AND THE PENSION AGENCY THE BANKS AND THE COMMITTEE REPRESENTING U- UNSECURED CREDITORS HAVE RECENTLY BEEN HOLDING SERIOUS DISCUSSIONS ON THE ISSUE
476c040f IN REACTION TO THE NEWS INTEREST RATES PLUNGED THE AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR FIRMED AND ANALYSTS PREDICTED STOCK:S WOULD MOVE HIGHER
476c040g <NOISE> <NOISE> BUT WHILE THE BUDGET GAVE A BOOST TO THE MARKETS IT ALSO *PRESAGED* A GREATER AUSTERITY FOR THE NATION AS A WHOLE
476c040h <NOISE> TO MR. HAWKE THAT IS AS IT SHOULD BE
476c040i <NOISE> AUSTRALIANS HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE AREN'T OUT OF THE WOODS YET HE SAYS
476c040j WE'VE GOT ENORMOUS PROBLEMS AND WE HAVE TO LEARN TO LIVE WITHIN OUR RESOURCES
476c040k <NOISE> DESPITE ALL THE UNCERTAINTY THAT SURROUNDED BRITISH PETROLEUM'S JUMBO OFFERING THERE WASN'T THAT MUCH TURMOIL IN THE MARKET WHEN SHARES BEGAN TO TRADE FRIDAY
476c040l B. P.'S PARTIALLY PAID AMERICAN DEPOSITARY SHARES CLOSED UNCHANGED <NOISE> AT SEVENTEEN AND A QUARTER WITH THIRTEEN POINT TWO MILLION TRADED
476c040m <NOISE> IT WAS THE BIG BOARD'S MOST ACTIVE ISSUE
476c040n THE ROLLBACKS COULD BE UNEXPECTEDLY PAINFUL FOR SOME HOURLY WORKERS
476c040o <NOISE> CHRYSLER'S UNEMPLOYMENT FUND HAS BEEN DRAINED TO THE POINT THAT BENEFITS ARE ALREADY BEING REDUCED <NOISE> A U. A. W. SPOKESMAN SAID
476c040p THE FUND HAS AT LEAST IN PART <NOISE> BEEN DRAINED BY WORKERS TEMPORARILY LAID OFF WHEN PLANTS WERE CLOSED DOWN FOR RETOOLING
476c040q HERE ARE PRICE TRENDS ON THE WORLD'S MAJOR STOCK MARKETS AS CALCULATED BY MORGAN STANLEY CAPITAL I- INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE GENEVA
476c040r TO MAKE THEM DIRECTLY COMPARABLE EACH INDEX IS BASED ON THE CLOSE OF NINETEEN SIXTY NINE EQUALING ONE HUNDRED
476c040s THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE IS SINCE YEAR END
476c040t <NOISE> WE WANT MORE INSTITUTIONAL ASSETS SAYS A KEMPER SPOKESWOMAN
476c040u WE THINK THE BUSINESS HOLDS CONSIDERABLE PROMISE FOR THE FUTURE SHE ADDS AND WE THINK CITICORP IS A CAPABLE ORGANIZATION
476c040v OTHERS SAY INSTITUTIONAL ASSET MANAGEMENT IS STILL CONSIDERED A GOOD BUSINESS DESPITE RELATIVELY LOW FEES AND SIGNS OF SLOWING GROWTH
476c040w FIRST BOSTON AND XEROX HAD NO COMMENT
476c040x <NOISE> THE CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER WOULD HAVE BOTH THE FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL BUSINESS REPORTING TO HIM
476c040y <NOISE> MR. SHELTON HAD LED AN IMPROVED PERFORMANCE OF THE LATTER DURING THE PAST TWO YEARS
476c040z HE ALSO HAS A LONG TERM RELATIONSHIP WITH COMPANY CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER WILLIAM S. WIRE THE SECOND WORKING FOR GENESCO SINCE NINETEEN FIFTY SIX
476c0410 FARM FUTURES PRICES HAVE FALLEN SEVERAL TIMES IN THE PAST TWO WEEKS FOLLOWING SEVERAL WEEKS OF DROUGHT INSPIRED RALLY
476c0411 <NOISE> YESTERDAY'S TRADING SEEMED TO SUPPORT THE NOTION AMONG SOME ANALYSTS THAT CORN AND WHEAT FUTURES ARE TOP HEAVY
476c0412 THE MARKET HAS BEEN OVERDONE SIGNIFICANTLY ON THE UPSIDE SAID RICHARD LOEWY SENIOR GRAIN AND OIL SEED ANALYST WITH PRUDENTIAL BACHE SECURITIES INCORPORATED
476c0413 THE PIPER HAS TO BE PAID ON THE OTHER SIDE
476c0414 <NOISE> ONE OF THE FOUR BUSINESSES INCLUDED IN THE LOCKUP OPTION GRANTED TO K. K. R. IS MACMILLAN'S DIRECTORY DIVISION <NOISE> WHICH CONSISTS OF WHO'S WHO <NOISE> AND NATIONAL REGISTRY PUBLISHING
476c0415 THUS IT WASN'T IMMEDIATELY CLEAR WHY INTERNATIONAL THOMSON MIGHT BE LOOKING AT THE OPERATION EVEN THOUGH IT IS INCLUDED IN THE LOCKUP OPTION
476c0416 A SPOKESMAN FOR K. K. R. ALSO DECLINED COMMENT
476c0417 THE DECISION FREES INTERIOR OFFICIALS TO FORMALLY OPEN OIL COMPANY BIDS TO LEASE UP TO FIVE POINT SIX MILLION ACRES IN A SALMON RICH AREA NEAR THE BERING SEA
476c0418 THE GOVERNMENT SOLICITED BIDS FOR THE SALE IN JANUARY NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX BUT UNTIL NOW HAS BEEN BARRED BY COURT ORDER FROM OPENING THEM
476c0419 OFFICIALS SAID THE BIDS WOULD BE OPENED IN ANCHORAGE ALASKA TUESDAY
476c041a TO BE SURE ON A LOT OF SCORES THE SUMMIT WAS A SUCCESS
476c041b ECONOMIC COOPERATION WAS ADVANCED WITH BUSINESSMEN SIGNING AGREEMENTS FOR ABOUT THIRTY CONTRACTS AND SEVERAL JOINT VENTURES
476c041c <NOISE> HUMAN RIGHTS TOO MAY HAVE TAKEN A STEP FORWARD IF GORBACHEV LIVES UP TO HIS PROMISE <NOISE> TO RELEASE ALL POLITICAL PRISONERS BY YEAR'S END
476c041d IN EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT THE POLITICAL SETTLEMENT ENVISIONED BY THE NON COMMUNISTS SEEMED PLAUSIBLE
476c041e <NOISE> SOVIET LEADER MIKHAIL GORBACHEV WAS A MAJOR REASON
476c041f MR. GORBACHEV SAW THE EXPANSIONIST AMBITIONS OF HIS PREDECESSORS STYMIED BY THE RESOLUTE CONTAINMENT POLICY OF BOTH CHINA <NOISE> AND THE PRO WESTERN A. S. E. A. N. POWERS
476c041g SUPPORT FOR THE VIETNAMESE OCCUPATION OF CAMBODIA COST THE SOVIET UNION ECONOMICALLY AND DIPLOMATICALLY
476c041h SO THE SOVIETS TRYING TO ELIMINATE THE MILITARY QUAGMIRE IN CAMBODIA PERSUADED HANOI'S LEADERS TO NEGOTIATE A MILITARY WITHDRAWAL FROM CAMBODIA
477c0201 LAST WEEK THERE WERE REPORTS THAT AFTER THE OFFERING SHEARSON LEHMAN HAD A BIG UNSOLD CHUNK OF STOCK
477c0202 IN A NARROWLY DRAWN STATEMENT VICE CHAIRMAN HERBERT FREIMAN DENIED SHEARSON HAD OFFERED A BLOCK TO SALOMON BROTHERS WHICH MANAGED THE SELLING BROKERS' FLOOR OPERATION
477c0203 MR. FREIMAN WOULDN'T ELABORATE
477c0204 THE SWISS FRANC BOND MARKET MEANWHILE REMAINED LISTLESS DESPITE A SHARP FALL IN THE DOLLAR
477c0205 MOST PRICES WERE UNCHANGED WITH AN AVERAGE TURNOVER *TRADERS* SAID
477c0206 ONE GENEVA TRADER SAID INVESTORS WERE STAYING OUT OF THE MARKET BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE THE BOTTOM IS IN THE DOLLAR'S CURRENT DECLINE
477c0207 CLOSELY HELD TRANSAMERICAN SAID IT ALSO AGREED TO SETTLE A DISPUTE WITH ANOTHER CREDITOR MEDALLION OIL COMPANY
477c0208 THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENTS WHICH MUST BE APPROVED BY THE BANKRUPTCY COURT WOULD REMOVE TWO MAJOR HURDLES IN TRANSAMERICAN'S LONG STRUGGLE TO GET OUT OF CHAPTER ELEVEN PROCEEDINGS
477c0209 TRANSAMERICAN FILED FOR COURT PROTECTION FROM CREDITORS IN JANUARY NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE WHEN IT WAS MIRED IN ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS OF DEBT
477c020a I RECEIVED WELFARE FOR EIGHT MONTHS AFTER MY SECOND CHILD WAS BORN
477c020b LUCKILY I WAS ABLE WITH THE HELP OF MY FAMILY TO GET A GOOD JOB AND RELIABLE CHILD CARE
477c020c <NOISE> BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF WELFARE MOTHERS OUT THERE WHO AREN'T THIS FORTUNATE
477c020d A LOT OF WOMEN DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET JOBS OR THE TRAINING NEEDED TO GET ONE AND SOMEONE TO WATCH THEIR CHILDREN
477c020e <NOISE> WHEN THAT SITUATION IS RESOLVED THEN YOU WILL SEE A LOT OF FORMER WELFARE RECIPIENTS BECOMING PRODUCTIVE MEMBERS OF SOCIETY
477c020f THE SUN BELT FORECAST PARTLY CLOUDY
477c020g ECONOMISTS EXPECT THE SOUTHEAST BUFFERED BY ITS BIG SERVICE ECONOMY TO CONTINUE TO OUTPERFORM THE NATION
477c020h BUT SOME OVERBUILT REAL ESTATE MARKETS COULD GET BASHED AND FLORIDA'S INFLUX OF RETIREES JOB SEEKERS AND TOURISTS COULD DWINDLE
477c020i THE SHAREHOLDER DAVID F. LAROCHE A PROVIDENCE RHODE ISLAND INVESTOR FILED THE SUIT IN A STATE SUPERIOR COURT IN NEWPORT
477c020j THE SUIT REQUESTS THE COURT TO ISSUE ORDERS PROHIBITING THE PROPOSED ACQUISITION AND REQUIRING NECO TO HOLD ITS ANNUAL MEETINGS AND SHAREHOLDERS TO ELECT FOUR DIRECTORS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
477c020k A SUPERIOR COURT JUDGE DECLINED TO ISSUE A- A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER REQUESTED BY THE SUIT TO BLOCK THE ACQUISITION SAID A COURT CLERK
477c020l IN ADDITION *LAURENTIAN* SAID BERNHARD M. KOCH THIRTY THREE WAS NAMED VICE PRESIDENT AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER
477c020m HE SUCCEEDS JOHN STROM WHO TRANSFERRED TO A LAURETARIAN CAPITAL UNIT
477c020n PREVIOUSLY MR. KOCH WAS DIRECTOR OF INTERNAL AUDIT AT LAURETARIAN GROUP CORPORATION AND IMPERIAL LIFE ASSURANCE COMPANY OF CANADA MAJORITY SHAREHOLDERS OF LAURETARIAN CAPITAL
477c020o EL SALVADOR'S DUARTE TRAVELED TO THE U. S. FOR TREATMENT OF WHAT HE DESCRIBED AS A MALIGNANT STOMACH DISEASE
477c020p THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN RUMORED TO HAVE CANCER
477c020q A SPOKESMAN SAID TESTS WOULD BE CONDUCTED AT WALTER REED ARMY MEDICAL CENTER IN WASHINGTON
477c020r HOW SERIOUS AND PATIENT INVESTOR INTEREST IS WILL BE TESTED NEXT MONTH
477c020s A GOVERNMENT OWNED INSURANCE AGENCY IS SET TO AUCTION OFF THE HYATT REGENCY MANILA
477c020t THE AGENCY HOPES TO REALIZE ITS TARGET PRICE OF THIRTEEN MILLION DOLLARS
477c020u THUS INSTEAD OF *CALMAT'S* BEING ACQUIRED SELECT ASSETS WOULD BE OPTIONED AND A HUNK OF STOCK WOULD BE IN RELATIVELY SAFE HANDS
477c020v CALMAT WOULD BE RID OF MR. BRIERLEY WHO APPEARS TO HAVE TRIED TO PUT THE COMPANY IN PLAY
477c020w INDUSTRIAL EQUITY EXECUTIVES IN CALIFORNIA DIDN'T RETURN CALLS SEEKING COMMENT
477c020x MR. CHATIHACHI'S WEALTHY FAMILY BACKGROUND AND HIS FAMILY'S LARGE PROPERTY INTERESTS GIVE HIM A GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY
477c020y FURTHER HE HAS GOOD RELATIONS WITH THE LARGE ETHNIC CHINESE COMMUNITY AND SERVES AS CHAIRMAN OF THE THAI CHINESE FRIENDSHIP ASSOCIATION
477c020z THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE COUNTRY'S BUSINESS ELITE MANY OF WHOM ARE ETHNIC CHINESE
477c0210 HOWEVER CONVENTIONAL FILM WILL BE MARGINALLY PROFITABLE AT BEST FOR POLAROID BECAUSE INITIALLY POLAROID WON'T BE MANUFACTURING THE FILM CONTENDS ELLIOTT NOVAK AN INDUSTRY CONSULTANT
477c0211 INSTEAD IT WILL BUY THE FILM FROM ANOTHER COMPANY AND PUT ITS NAME ON IT JUST AS IT DOES WITH VIDEOTAPE
477c0212 <NOISE> SINCE IT BEGAN SELLING VIDEOTAPE A FEW YEARS AGO <NOISE> POLAROID HAS BUILT UP AN IMPRESSIVE TWELVE PERCENT MARKET SHARE MAKING IT THE LEADER IN THE U. S.
477c0213 BUT FIERCE COMPETITION HAS KEPT VIDEOTAPE PROFITS SLIM AND THE CONVENTIONAL FILM BUSINESS ISN'T LIKELY TO PROVE ANY BONANZA EITHER
477c0214 PETER DAPOZZO HEAD OF <NOISE> RETAIL TRADING AT SHEARSON LEHMAN HUTTON <NOISE> ALSO LOOKS FOR A SHARP UPWARD MOVE IN STOCK PRICES GIVEN A FEW IFS
477c0215 ONE IS IF INVESTORS DON'T GET SPOOKED AT THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE CRASH
477c0216 ANOTHER IS IF THE FEDERAL RESERVE EASES INTEREST RATES
477c0217 AND A THIRD IS IF GEORGE BUSH WINS THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION
477c0218 I DON'T KNOW IF THE PARENTS UNDERSTAND HOW SUBTLE THIS NEW AGE MOVEMENT REALLY IS SHE SAYS
477c0219 THEY DRAW THE KIDS IN WITH FAIRY TALES AND SORCERY
477c021a THEIR ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO DO AWAY WITH ANYBODY WHO BELIEVES THERE'S SUCH A THING AS EVIL
477c021b BUT YAMAICHI DENIED THE RUMORS
477c021c THIS MAKES A DOZEN CALLS I'VE HAD ON THIS TODAY SAID AN ANNOYED TRADING OFFICIAL AT YAMAICHI'S NEW YORK BASED U. S. SUBSIDIARY
477c021d HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE FIRM ACTIVELY SOLD S. AND P. FIVE HUNDRED FUTURES LAST WEEK AND THAT DEAN WITTER HANDLED SOME OF THE SALES
477c021e BUT HE ADDED THAT WE HAVEN'T BEEN A HEAVY SELLER A:T ALL THIS WEEK
477c0301 THE BROADCASTING PROPERTIES HAVE LONG BEEN REGARDED AS GENCORP'S BEST DEFENSE AGAINST A HOSTILE TAKEOVER
477c0302 LICENSES FOR TWO OF THE TELEVISION STATIONS AND ALL THE RADIO STATIONS ARE BEING CHALLENGED BY TWO GROUPS WHICH CHARGE THAT GENCORP IS AN UNFIT OPERATOR
477c0303 THE DISPUTE INCLUDES ALLEGATIONS THAT GENCORP FAILED TO ADEQUATELY INFORM THE F. C. C. OF ALLEGEDLY IMPROPER CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS AND FOREIGN PAYMENTS
477c0304 THE NEW TAX LAW'S LIMITS ON RETIREMENT BENEFITS FOR EXECUTIVES SPUR GREATER INTEREST IN CERTAIN TRUSTS THAT HELP SAFEGUARD DEFERRED COMPENSATION UNTIL RETIREMENT TIME
477c0305 SUCH TRUSTS AREN'T COMPLETELY INVIOLATE CREDITORS CAN CLAIM THE MONEY AFTER A BANKRUPTCY FOR INSTANCE
477c0306 BUT THEY ARE CONSIDERED BETTER THAN A MERE PROMISE TO AN EXECUTIVE
477c0307 J. W. T. HADN'T YET RESPONDED TO W. P. P.'S WEDNESDAY BID OF FORTY FIVE DOLLARS A SHARE OR ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS
477c0308 ON FRIDAY W. P. P. LAUNCHED A HOSTILE FORTY FIVE DOLLAR A SHARE TENDER OFFER FOR J. W. T.'S APPROXIMATELY TEN MILLION SHARES OUTSTANDING
477c0309 THAT HOSTILE OFFER FORMALLY REMAINED IN EFFECT DESPITE W. P. P.'S LATEST MOVE
477c030a AT A MEETING WITH ANALYSTS ROBERT M. KAVNER A. T. AND T.'S CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER SAID IT APPEARS WE WILL HAVE A GOOD YEAR
477c030b BUT IN RESPONSE TO AN ANALYST'S QUESTION HE SAID EARNINGS OF TWO DOLLARS A SHARE SOUNDS STRONG
477c030c HE ALSO WARNED ANALYSTS AGAINST LOOKING AT A PARTICULAR QUARTER AND ISOLATING IT ADDING WE ARE LOOKING FOR THE ANNUAL TREND LINE
477c030d THERE'S SOME PAPER OUT FOR BIDS YOU HAVEN'T HEARD ABOUT CADWALLADER BECAUSE YOU DO ONLY DOMESTIC
477c030e COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT BONDS WITH THE COUPON INDEXED TO THE STREET PRICE OF COCAINE
477c030f SOLID INVESTMENT BUT INTRIGUING
477c030g I THINK WE'RE GOING TO SPRING FOR THAT
477c030h WITH A REBOUND IN THE STOCK MARKET INVESTORS' FEARS ABOUT A RECESSION COOLED AND THE BOND MARKET SLUMPED
477c030i A SHARP SLIDE IN THE U. S. DOLLAR ALSO ADDED SOME DOWNWARD PRESSURE TO BOND PRICES
477c030j DESPITE THE DECLINE IN BONDS THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM STILL CONTINUED TO MAKE GOOD ON ITS PROMISE TO PROVIDE AMPLE LIQUIDITY THROUGH ITS OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS
477c030k DESPITE ALL THE UNCERTAINTY THAT SURROUNDED BRITISH PETROLEUM'S JUMBO OFFERING THERE STILL WASN'T THAT MUCH TURMOIL IN THE MARKET WHEN SHARES BEGAN TO TRADE FRIDAY
477c030l B. P.'S PARTIALLY PAID AMERICAN DEPOSITARY SHARES CLOSED UNCHANGED AT SEVENTEEN AND A QUARTER WITH THIRTEEN POINT TWO MILLION TRADED
477c030m IT WAS THE BIG BOARD'S MOST ACTIVE ISSUE
477c030n UNTIL NOW NASDAQ OR THE N. A. S. D.'S AUTOMATED QUOTATION SYSTEM HAS PROVIDED COMPUTER TERMINALS WITH PRICE QUOTATIONS ON ALL ISSUES
477c030o MOST BIG TRADES HOWEVER ARE NEGOTIATED BY TELEPHONE AND THEN RECORDED IN THE SYSTEM'S COMPUTERS
477c030p ONLY THE SMALL ORDER SYSTEM HAS PROVIDED TRADERS WITH THE ABILITY TO EXECUTE TRADES BY COMPUTER RATHER THAN BY TELEPHONE
477c030q STILL COMPANY INSIDERS SAID THE RESTRUCTURING WAS ENTIRELY MR. AKERS'S PLAN AND WASN'T FORCED ON HIM BY THE I. B. M. BOARD
477c030r A DIRECTOR SAID THE BOARD LEARNED OF THE PLAN AT ITS MEETING LAST TUESDAY
477c030s JOHN FOUND EVERYTHING WAS COMING ONTO HIS DESK AND HE HAD MORE THAN HE COULD A- COPE WITH ANOTHER DIRECTOR SAID
477c030t HE WANTED AN ORGANIZATION WHICH RESOLVED MORE PROBLEMS BEFORE THEY GOT TO HIM
477c030u THE E. P. A. PROPOSED MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR MUNICIPAL TRASH DUMPS THAT THE AGENCY ESTIMATED WILL COST EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR
477c030v THE PROPOSED RULES WOULD REQUIRE ABOUT SIX THOUSAND DUMPS TO INSTALL GROUNDWATER MONITORING SYSTEMS
477c030w THEY WOULD ALSO CLOSE SOME DUMPS AND PUT SPECIAL CONDITIONS ON OTHERS IN CERTAIN AREAS
477c030x HOPING TO PREVENT LONG COSTLY DISPUTES OVER WHAT DOCUMENTS DEFENDANTS HAVE TO SURRENDER JUDGES GRANT BLANKET PROTECTIVE ORDERS
477c030y THE ORDERS TYPICALLY BAR PUBLIC DISSEMINATION OF RECORDS AND DEPOSITIONS EVEN AFTER SETTLEMENT OR VERDICT
477c030z PLAINTIFFS' LAWYERS GENERALLY HAVEN'T BALKED AS LONG AS THEY CAN GET THE INFORMATION THEY NEED TO PREPARE FOR THEIR TRIALS
477c0310 RANDOM HOUSE A SUBSIDIARY OF THE NEWHOUSE FAMILY'S ADVANCE PUBLICATIONS INCORPORATED <NOISE> SAID THE MOVE WILL TAKE IT OUT OF THE TEXTBOOK PUBLISHING BUSINESS
477c0311 THE TWO DIVISIONS TOGETHER ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS TO NINETY MILLION DOLLARS IN ANNUAL SALES SAID ROBERT BERNSTEIN RANDOM HOUSE CHAIRMAN
477c0312 MR. BERNSTEIN NOTED THAT RANDOM HOUSE HAS EXPANDED IN OTHER DIRECTIONS NOTABLY IN TRADE PUBLISHING
477c0313 TRADE BOOKS ARE ALL BOOKS SOLD DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS IN BOOK STORES AND THROUGH MAIL ORDERS
477c0314 A. YES WITHOUT QUESTION
477c0315 IT'S MY SENSE THAT THERE WAS A TIME WHEN PEOPLE THOUGHT THEY COULD TRADE ON INSIDE INFORMATION WITH ABSOLUTE IMPUNITY
477c0316 AND THAT'S NO LONGER TRUE
477c0317 NOW I AM CERTAIN THAT THERE ARE STILL PEOPLE WHO THINK THEY CAN TRADE ON INSIDE INFORMATION AND GET AWAY WITH IT BECAUSE THEY'RE SMARTER THAN THE AVERAGE PERSON
477c0318 THERE WILL ALWAYS BE THOSE PEOPLE
477c0319 BUT I THINK THAT THE ACTIONS HAVE HAD A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON CONDUCT
477c031a THIS GROWING RELIANCE ON THIRD PARTIES TO SELL PRODUCTS COULD HINDER HEWLETT PACKARD'S ABILITY TO MANAGE ITS BUSINESS AND MAKE THE COMPANY'S STOCK LESS ATTRACTIVE TO INVESTORS
477c031b YOU BOUGHT H. P. STOCK IN THE PAST BECAUSE IT HAD MORE CONTROL OVER ITS DESTINY THAN OTHER ELECTRONICS FIRMS MR. WU SAID
477c031c TODAY H. P. HAS LESS CONTROL OVER ITS FUTURE
477c031d A SPOKESWOMAN FOR ASHLAND SAID WE HAVE BEEN OUTRAGED BY THIS ENTIRE INCIDENT
477c031e COMPANY OFFICIALS NOTIFIED FEDERAL AUTHORITIES TWO YEARS AGO THAT THE IRANIANS HAD ACCESS TO THE DOCUMENTS AND REQUESTED A- AN INVESTIGATION
477c031f ASHLAND WAS SHOCKED TO LEARN OF MR. ATKINSON'S INVOLVEMENT THE SPOKESWOMAN SAID
477c0401 THE WORD IS TERROR
477c0402 MY FEAR OF FAILURE MAY BE GREATER IN SOME RESPECTS
477c0403 PEOPLE SAY ADVERSITY IS GOOD FOR YOU
477c0404 WELL THAT'S NOT EXACTLY TRUE
477c0405 <NOISE> I'M NOT THE SAME PERSON I WAS
477c0406 TRADING VOLUME HAS BEEN LETHARGIC FOR THE PAST FEW WEEKS PARTLY REFLECTING CONFUSION ABOUT THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK
477c0407 IMPORTANT CLUES ARE EXPECTED TO EMERGE FRIDAY WHEN THE LABOR DEPARTMENT REPORTS EMPLOYMENT FIGURES FOR FEBRUARY
477c0408 MANY ANALYSTS EXPECT THE STATISTICS TO INDICATE THAT THE ECONOMY REMAINS WEAK AND THAT LOWER INTEREST RATES A- LIE AHEAD
477c0409 BUT THE EMPLOYMENT STATISTICS ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO PREDICT AND INDIVIDUAL ESTIMATES VARY WIDELY
477c040a BUT SOME INDUSTRY ANALYSTS ARE SKEPTICAL ABOUT S. H. V.'S INTENTIONS
477c040b THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON THERE SAID HUMPHREY HARRISON AN ANALYST AT COUNTY SECURITIES
477c040c I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE END GAME IS BUT I DOUBT THEY S. H. V. WILL REMAIN AT TWENTY EIGHT PERCENT
477c040d MR. REINHARD REMEMBERS AN INDIAN COMMERCIAL TWO YEARS AGO AT THE PRESTIGIOUS CANNES FESTIVAL NO RELATION TO THE FILM FESTIVAL THERE
477c040e IT SHOWED A- A UP CLOSE OF A FLATULENT ELEPHANT'S BACKSIDE WHILE AN ANNOUNCER EXPLAINED THE SOUND IN PLAIN LANGUAGE
477c040f THE COMMERCIAL PLUGGED AN ANTACID FOR HUMANS
477c040g IT DIDN'T WIN
477c040h TEXACO FILED FOR CHAPTER ELEVEN PROTECTION CITING THE BURDEN OF ITS TEN POINT THREE BILLION DOLLAR LEGAL BATTLE WITH PENNZOIL
477c040i THE BANKRUPTCY LAW CASE THE LARGEST IN HISTORY CAME AFTER BOTH FIRMS APPARENTLY REMAINED ABOUT TWO BILLION DOLLARS APART IN SETTLEMENT TALKS
477c040j THOUGH THE FILING COMPLICATES THE BATTLE MOST EXPERTS BELIEVE NEITHER COMPANY WILL EMERGE THE WINNER
477c040k BUT THE OIL WORKERS HAD A CANDIDATE TOO AND AS THE PRIMARY DREW NEAR STRANGE THINGS STARTED HAPPENING IN EBANO
477c040l NEIGHBORHOODS WITH TAP WATER SUDDENLY FOUND THEMSELVES CUT OFF
477c040m PHONES RANG WITH DEATH THREATS
477c040n THE WORLD IS MADE UP OF OPTIMISTS AND PESSIMISTS SAYS MR. STONE
477c040o IN THIS INDUSTRY IN THIS STATE THEY'RE MOSTLY PESSIMISTS
477c040p I MAY BE THE LAST OPTIMIST BUT I'M SURE I'M RIGHT <NOISE>
477c040q LOCAL NEWSPAPERS YESTERDAY SAID THE GOVERNMENT MAY QUALIFY THE DECISION TO SIGN THE RESTRUCTURING AGREEMENT
477c040r BUT OFFICIAL SOURCES SAID THE SIGNING IS LIKELY TO TAKE PLACE DURING THE LAST WEEK IN SEPTEMBER
477c040s THE SIGNING DEADLINE IS OCTOBER FIRST
477c040t ART COLLECTORS AND DEALERS HEAVED A SIGH OF RELIEF LAST NIGHT
477c040u AFTER HIGH PRICES AND FRANTIC BIDDING AT ART AUCTIONS LAST SPRING ABOUT ONE IN FOUR WORKS DIDN'T SELL AT A CONTEMPORARY ART AUCTION AT CHRISTIE'S
477c040v BUT AT LEAST THE MARKET DIDN'T CRASH
477c040w NO FINAL BUDGET DECISIONS HAVE BEEN MADE AT THE WHITE HOUSE
477c040x BUDGET DRAFTING IS BEHIND SCHEDULE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES WON'T EVEN SEE O. M. B. RECOMMENDATIONS UNTIL LATE THIS WEEK
477c040y <NOISE> BUT IT'S ALREADY CLEAR THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS INCREASED ITS EMPHASIS ON EDUCATION
477c040z I THINK IT'S A PERFECTLY HONORABLE PROFESSION
477c0410 <NOISE> IF MORE OF US DID IT THE OPPORTUNITIES WOULD GET SMALLER BECAUSE MORE FIRMS WOULD BE COMPETING TO CLOSE THE SAME SPREADS HE SAYS
477c0411 THE PRODUCT IS A LEGITIMATE HEDGING PRODUCT AND A L- LEGITIMATE WAY TO ADD LIQUIDITY TO THE MARKET
477c0412 <NOISE> REAL ESTATE INDUSTRY SOURCES SAID INTENSE FRICTION BETWEEN SALVATORE RANIERI AND MR. DAVIS DEVELOPED DURI(NG)- DURING THE KIAWAH NEGOTIATIONS
477c0413 SALVATORE RANIERI DIDN'T RETURN A REPORTER'S TELEPHONE CALL
477c0414 A SPOKESMAN FOR MR. DAVIS DIDN'T DISPUTE THE REPORT OF PERSONAL FRICTION
477c0415 BANKS THAT COMMIT TO THE NEW CREDIT BY TODAY GET A FEE EQUAL TO ZERO POINT THREE SEVEN FIVE PERCENT OF THE AMOUNT THEY COMMIT
477c0416 IT WON'T BE CLEAR UNTIL AFTER THE WEEKEND HOW MANY COMMITMENTS HAVE BEEN RECEIVED
477c0417 BUT SOME BANKERS CLOSE TO THE TRANSACTION ESTIMATE THAT ABOUT EIGHTY PERCENT OR SLIGHTLY MORE THAN FOUR BILLION DOLLARS WOULD BE COMMITTED BY EARLY NEXT WEEK
477c0418 MR. LENNANE HAD STARTED THE BIDDING IN JUNE BY PROPOSING TO TAKE THE COMPANY PRIVATE FOR SEVEN POINT TWO FIVE DOLLARS A SHARE
477c0419 AFTER THE BOARD RETAINED KIDDER PEABODY AND COMPANY TO REVIEW THE BID THE COMPANY MET WITH OTHER POTENTIAL ACQUIRERS
477c041a IN AUGUST MR. LENNANE INCREASED ITS BID TO EIGHT DOLLARS A SHARE
477c041b ASHTON TATE HAS BEEN PLAGUED BY OPERATING LOSSES AND MANAGEMENT TURMOIL
477c041c LAST MONTH IT REPORTED A NINETEEN POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLAR SECOND QUARTER NET LOSS AS WELL AS THE RESIGNATION OF ITS PRESIDENT AND CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER

479c030y IT ALSO ALREADY OWNS ITS BOTTLERS IN CENTRAL AND NORTHERN FLORIDA AND PARTS OF GEORGIA
479c030z THERE ARE SOME GREAT OPPORTUNITIES TO MAXIMIZE PRODUCTION AND MARKETING EFFICIENCIES THE PEPSICO SPOKESMAN SAID
479c0310 DURING ANY REPAIR PROCESS BLOOD CLOTS ARE CONSTANTLY BEING FORMED AND DISSOLVED <NOISE>
479c0311 <NOISE> IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE SCIENTISTS SPECULATE THAT DURING ATTEMPTS TO REPAIR THE ARTERY WALL THE BODY AT SOME POINT TRIES TO DISSOLVE A BLOOD CLOT
479c0312 BUT IT MISTAKENLY GRABS PROTEIN A. INSTEAD OF PLASMINOGEN <NOISE> PULLING IT WITH ITS BAG OF FAT AND CHOLESTEROL INTO THE ARTERY WALL
479c0313 THIS THWARTS THE REPAIR PROCESS AND BEGINS A VICIOUS CYCLE DRAWING MORE AND MORE CHOLESTEROL INTO THE DAMAGED AREA
479c0314 AND IN FACT MICROSCOPIC BLOOD CLOTS AND BITS OF L. P. A. <NOISE> ARE FOUND IN THE MISHMASH OF THE DEPOSITS
479c0315 HOWEVER HE LEAVES PRIME AT A DIFFICULT TIME
479c0316 THE COMPUTER MARKET IS GROWING SLOWLY AND PRIME'S PROPRIETARY SYSTEMS ARE LOSING GROUND TO INDUSTRY STANDARD COMPUTERS THAT USE THE UNIX OPERATING SYSTEM
479c0317 AND SOME WALL STREET ANALYSTS THINK PRIME SHOULD HAVE CUT COSTS MORE RAPIDLY IN THE WAKE OF THE COMPUTERVISION ACQUISITION
479c0318 DETAILS ARE STILL MURKY ABOUT THE REST OF THE CREDITS
479c0319 ITALIAN OFFICIALS SAY THAT ROME'S DECISION TO GRANT ABOUT A SEVEN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR GUARANTEE OF EXPORT CREDITS WAS PRIMARILY A POLITICAL RATHER THAN A BANKING DECISION
479c031a BRITAIN'S MIDLAND BANK HAS ANNOUNCED PLANS FOR A NUMBER ONE BILLION CREDIT LINE <NOISE> THOUGH SOME BRITISH BANKS MAY BE GETTING COLD FEET ABOUT PARTICIPATING
479c031b FRENCH BANKS HAVE YET TO ANNOUNCE THEIR PLANS OFFICIALLY BUT ARE SAID TO BE CONSIDERING LOANS OF TWO BILLION DOLLARS
479c031c SOME BANKING ANALYSTS DOUBT A LONDON OR TOKYO BANK WOULD MAKE A SIMILAR ACQUISITION ANYTIME HERE SOON

479c0409 A NEW RATE WILL BE SET JUNE EIGHTH AND EVERY FORTY NINE DAYS THEREAFTER THROUGH A DUTCH AUCTION SAID SALOMON BROTHERS INCORPORATED HEAD UNDERWRITER

479c040e AND A HONG KONG ANALYST SAYS DRAGONAIR MISSED A BIG CHANCE TO IMPROVE ON ITS CHINA TRADE VIRTUALLY AT THE CARRIER'S INCEPTION

479c040j STILL MR. JOSEPHS AND OTHERS THINK THAT THE CHANGES WILL BE GOOD FOR THE FARM ECONOMY IN GENERAL
479c040k MANY OF THESE GENTLEMEN FARMERS WERE TAX MOTIVATED NOT PROFIT DRIVEN HE SAYS
479c040l SOME ARE UNFAIR COMPETITION AGAINST THE REGULAR FARMER <NOISE> WHO'S TRYING TO MAKE A BUCK
479c040m YESTERDAY THE AGENCY REVERSED THE NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR FINDING THAT MEREDITH HAD VIOLATED THE DOCTRINE
479c040n THE SO CALLED FAIRNESS DOCTRINE IS A MISNOMER SAID DIANE KILLORY THE AGENCY'S GENERAL COUNSEL
479c040o IT PROMOTES BLANDNESS AND NOTHINGNESS BY CHILLING THE VERY SPEECH IT WAS MEANT TO FOSTER
479c040p IN SOME SECTORS THOUGH INTRIGUING OPTIONS ARE SPRINGING UP
479c040q INVESTMENT CONSULTANTS MANY OF WHOM WORK FOR MAJOR BROKERAGES SCREEN MONEY MANAGERS FOR POTENTIAL CLIENTS
479c040r SEVERAL HAVE CREATED LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS THAT POOL THE MONEY OF INVESTORS WITH SIMILAR INVESTMENT GOALS
479c040s THOSE PARTNERSHIPS ARE THEN MANAGED BY INDIVIDUAL PORTFOLIO MANAGERS
479c040t ANNUAL FEES FOR SUCH ACCOUNTS HOWEVER OFTEN RUN AS HIGH AS THREE PERCENT INCLUDING TRANSACTION COSTS
479c040u <NOISE> A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR ISSUE OF HOUSEHOLD FINANCE CORPORATION <NOISE> SEVEN YEAR NOTES WAS OFFERED THROUGH UNDERWRITERS LED BY MERRILL LYNCH CAPITAL MARKETS <NOISE>

479c0410 I THINK THE MARKET JUMPED THE GUN ON THE NOTION OF A WEAK ECONOMY AND THE FED EASING MR. FINE SAID <NOISE>
479c0411 SO WHAT WE'RE SEEING NOW IS A CONSOLIDATION
479c0412 HE EXPECTS LONG TERM TREASURY BOND YIELDS TO HOVER AROUND THE EIGHT AND ONE HALF PERCENT LEVEL IN THE NEAR FUTURE
479c0413 <NOISE> TREASURYS WON'T RESUME TRADING UNTIL THE TOKYO MARKET OPENS MONDAY
479c0414 <NOISE> THIS SOME ANALYSTS SAY MAY MEAN THAT THE LONDON MARKET REACTION WILL BE CONFINED <NOISE> TO A BRIEF ADJUSTMENT AT THE OPENING
479c0415 NEVERTHELESS TRADERS ARE EXPECTED TO TAKE NEUTRAL POSITIONS THROUGH THE WEEKEND JUST IN CASE THE DIFFICULT TO FORECAST DATA PRODUCE A NASTY SURPRISE
479c0416 IF VIETNAM DOES WITHDRAW CONDITIONS MIGHT ALSO <NOISE> BECOME RIPE <NOISE> FOR A HIGH LEVEL SUMMIT BETWEEN CHINA AND THE SOVIET UNION
479c0417 CHINESE LEADER DENG XIAOPING HAS REPEATEDLY SAID THAT BEIJING AND MOSCOW CAN'T NORMALIZE RELATIONS UNTIL THE RUSSIAN BACKED VIETNAMESE LEAVE CAMBODIA
479c0418 THE U. S. WELCOMES A BEIJING MOSCOW THAW WHICH WASHINGTON HAS CONCLUDED ISN'T LIKELY TO EVOLVE INTO THE KIND OF STRATEGIC ALLIANCE THEY MAINTAINED IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES
479c0419 <NOISE> THE SUIT CHARGES <NOISE> THAT BURGER KING ONLY ALLOWS BLACK FRANCHISES TO EXPAND ONE STORE AT A TIME WHILE WHITES ARE ALLOWED TO SIMULTANEOUSLY OPEN MULTIPLE FRANCHISES
479c041a BURGER KING ALSO MAKES BLACKS WAIT THREE TO FOUR TIMES LONGER THAN WHITES FOR APPROVAL OF A NEW OR EXPANSION FRANCHISE THE SUIT SAYS
479c041b THE FRANCHISEES FURTHER ALLEGE THAT BURGER KING FALSELY AND FRAUDULENTLY MISREPRESENTED THE THE SALES POTENTIAL OF THEIR STORES
47ac0201 A SPOKESWOMAN FOR C. B. S. SAID THERE ARE SERIOUS ISSUES AND WE'RE TRYING OUR BEST TO FIND SOLUTIONS WHILE OPERATING IN A VERY DEMANDING ECONOMIC CLIMATE
47ac0202 <NOISE> WE'RE CONTINUING TO BARGAIN
47ac0203 CAPITAL CITIES /SLASH A. B. C. DECLINED TO COMMENT ON THE TALKS
47ac0204 WE HAD TO SCOUR THE EARTH TO ACHIEVE THAT SETTLEMENT MR. LIEBMANN SAID
47ac0205 BUT THROUGH IT ALL RALPH WAS CALM AND RATIONAL
47ac0206 <NOISE> HE DOESN'T PANIC WHEN THINGS START TO GO WRONG
47ac0207 <NOISE> IN A LEVERAGED BUYOUT A GROUP OF INVESTORS BUYS A COMPANY AND TAKES IT PRIVATE USING MOSTLY BORROWED FUNDS TO FINANCE THE TRANSACTION
47ac0208 CASH FLOW AND OFTEN ASSET VALUES ARE USED TO PAY DOWN THE DEBT
47ac0209 FOR INVESTORS THE APPEAL IS THE PROSPECT OF A BIG RETURN WHEN THE RESTRUCTURED COMPANY IS REFINANCED OR SOLD IN A FEW YEARS
47ac020a BURLINGTON ALSO HAS BEEN MOVING AGGRESSIVELY IN COURT TO COUNTER THE HOSTILE BID
47ac020b <NOISE> YESTERDAY IT FILED ITS SECOND LAWSUIT AGAINST THE GROUP AND DISCLOSED THAT IT MAY TURN THE TABLES AND SEEK TO ACQUIRE CONTROL OF MONTREAL BASED DOMINION

47ac020d <NOISE> A. :COLON THE PRESS ASSERTS THIS ALL THE TIME AND I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY
47ac020e I MUST SAY I HAVE NOT YET FOUND THAT THIS IS GOING TO CHANGE THE FUNDAMENTALS OF THE PROBLEM
47ac020f I MEAN THE EUROPEAN BANKS HAVE BEEN BETTER RESERVED THAN WE FOR A LONG TIME
47ac020g <NOISE> IT HASN'T SEEMED TO AFFECT THE DIALOGUE ALL THAT MUCH
47ac020h NUCLEAR POWER REMAINS TODAY FRAUGHT WITH POTENTIAL FOR GREAT DANGER TO HUMAN LIFE MR. MIKVA WROTE
47ac020i CONGRESS THUS LIMITED THE DISCRETION OF THE COMMISSION IN CARRYING OUT THE MANDATE TO ENSURE ADEQUATE PROTECTION OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY
47ac020j CONGRESS LEFT NO ROOM FOR THE COMMISSION WHEN OPERATING WITHIN THIS SPHERE TO USE COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS
47ac020k ALSO PROVIDING MORE SOLACE FOR MUNICIPAL BOND PROFESSIONALS IS THE FACT THAT COMMERCIAL BANKS ARE BECOMING MORE ACTIVE AS UNDERWRITERS RATHER THAN AS INVESTORS
47ac020l THIS MEANS THEY WILL NEED TO HIRE MORE INVESTMENT BANKERS
47ac020m THE BANKS' MOVE IS PART OF THEIR EFFORT TO TEST AND EXPAND THE LIMITS OF SECURITIES AND BANKING LAWS
47ac020n INSTEAD DAYTON HUDSON'S EARNINGS HAVE BEEN DEPRESSED MORE THAN A YEAR BY MERCHANDISING PROBLEMS IN ITS MERVYN'S DEPARTMENT STORE UNIT
47ac020o ANALYSTS SAID THE TROUBLE STARTED WITH MERVYN'S CONCENTRATING TOO MUCH ON OPENING NEW STORES <NOISE> AND NOT ENOUGH ON PROVIDING BRAND NAME MERCHANDISE
47ac020p TOP MANAGEMENT WAS SLOW TO RECOGNIZE THE PROBLEMS SOME ANALYSTS SAID
47ac020q AND MANAGEMENT HAS BEEN TOO OPTIMISTIC IN PREDICTING THE TIMING OF A TURNAROUND THE ANALYSTS SAID
47ac020r WALL STREET IN GENERAL HAS BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT G. M. IN RECENT WEEKS BECAUSE OF ITS NEW LABOR CONTRACT
47ac020s THE THREE YEAR PACT INCLUDES A JOB SECURITY PROGRAM THAT PREVENTS LAYOFFS EXCEPT DURING A SALES DROP PREVENTS PLANT CLOSINGS AND SLOWS ATTRITION
47ac020t MANY ANALYSTS PREDICT THE PROVISIONS WILL HAMPER G. M.'S EFFORTS TO RESTRUCTURE OPERATIONS AND SHED UNCOMPETITIVE PLANTS PARTICULARLY IN PARTS OPERATIONS
47ac020u <NOISE> DESPITE ALL THE UNCERTAINTY THAT SURROUNDED BRITISH PETROLEUM'S JUMBO OFFERING THERE WASN'T THAT MUCH TURMOIL IN THE MARKET WHEN SHARES BEGAN TO TRADE FRIDAY
47ac020v <NOISE> B. P.'S PARTIALLY PAID AMERICAN DEPOSITARY SHARES CLOSED UNCHANGED AT SEVENTEEN AND A QUARTER <NOISE> WITH THIRTEEN POINT TWO MILLION TRADED
47ac020w IT WAS THE BIG BOARD'S MOST ACTIVE ISSUE
47ac020x JUAN CALDERA A SIXTY TWO YEAR OLD AGRICULTURAL WORKER FROM CIUDAD JUAREZ CHIHUAHUA IS OUTSIDE FREDDY'S AT ONE A. M. LOOKING FOR HIS EMPLOYER
47ac020y <NOISE> FOR HIS AMNESTY APPLICATION MR. CALDERA NEEDS THE BOSS'S SIGNATURE TO HELP PROVE THAT HE HAS WORKED IN THE FIELDS FOR AT LEAST NINETY DAYS
47ac020z ACTUALLY MR. CALDERA HAS WORKED IN THE FIELDS FOR ALMOST THIRTY YEARS
47ac0210 THE CUOMO PLAN DOESN'T STOP AT GOUGING NEW YORK TAXPAYERS AND LONG ISLAND RATEPAYERS
47ac0211 FEDERAL TAXPAYERS ALSO WILL CONTRIBUTE
47ac0212 <NOISE> THE KEY TO THE DEAL IS THAT LILCO ALSO WOULD GET A TWO POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLAR TAX WRITE OFF FOR SHOREHAM
47ac0213 THIS WOULD GUARANTEE THAT THE UTILITY WON'T HAVE TO PAY ANY FEDERAL TAXES FOR AT LEAST A DECADE
47ac0214 NEW YORK WOULD ALSO HELP LILCO FLOAT ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN TAX EXEMPT INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT BONDS TO HELP PAY FOR THE CLEANUP
47ac0215 MAKE THAT DE INDUSTRIALIZATION BONDS
47ac0216 BUT MR. PETERSON SAYS THERE STILL IS AN IMAGE PROBLEM
47ac0217 IF WE HAVEN'T WORKED WITH A COMPANY BEFORE THE NATURAL REACTION IS WHY THE HELL ARE YOU BRINGING IN ACCOUNTANTS TO WORK IN THE PLANT
47ac0218 YET WE PROBABLY HAVE THE LARGEST MANUFACTURING CONSULTING PRACTICE IN THE WORLD
47ac0219 THE REASON FOR THE RELATIVELY MODEST INCENTIVE PROGRAMS IS THAT THE AUTO MAKERS ARE DEMONSTRATING A MUCH BETTER ABILITY TO KEEP PRODUCTION IN LINE WITH SALES
47ac021a INVENTORIES OF U. S. MADE CARS STOOD AT FIFTY NINE DAYS SUPPLY AT THE END OF AUGUST ACCORDING TO WARD'S AUTOMOTIVE REPORTS AN INDUSTRY TRADE PUBLICATION
47ac021b <NOISE> THAT IS CONSIDERED A NORMAL SUPPLY AND IT IS THE LOWEST STOCK IN TWENTY TWO MONTHS
47ac021c NOT ALL BLACK COLLEGES ARE ON THE ROPES
47ac021d IN FACT A NUMBER OF ELITE INSTITUTIONS ARE THRIVING IN PART BECAUSE OF THEIR HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL FUND RAISING EFFORTS
47ac021e LAST WEEK FOR INSTANCE MR. COSBY AND HIS WIFE CAMILLE DONATED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS TO SPELMAN COLLEGE A BLACK WOMEN'S COLLEGE IN ATLANTA
47ac0301 BORG WARNER EASED THREE EIGHTHS TO FORTY ONE AND THREE EIGHTHS ON SIX HUNDRED THIRTY NINE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SHARES
47ac0302 MINSTAR AND BEAR STEARNS ENTERED INTO AN OPTION AGREEMENT FOR THE POSSIBLE PURCHASE OF THREE MILLION TWENTY NINE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED BORG WARNER SHARES
47ac0303 THE PURCHASES WOULD BOOST MINSTAR'S BORG WARNER STAKE TO EIGHT POINT FIVE PERCENT
47ac0304 YESTERDAY G. A. F. ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAS REQUIRED <NOISE> NINE POINT NINE SIX PERCENT INVESTMENT STAKE IN BORG WARNER
47ac0305 LAST MONTH PIEDMONT'S BOARD RECOMMENDED THAT THE COMPANY ACCEPT N- NORFOLK SOUTHERN'S BID TO ACQUIRE THE COMPANY FOR SIXTY FIVE DOLLARS A SHARE
47ac0306 NORFOLK SOUTHERN HAS HAD A STAKE IN PIEDMONT SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE
47ac0307 BUT ONE DAY AFTER THE BOARD'S RECOMMENDATION U. S. AIR SWEETENED ITS INITIAL BID FOR PIEDMONT FORCING THE BOARD TO DROP ITS RECOMMENDATION
47ac0308 IN FACT GIVEN THE HIGHLY DEVELOPED U. S. TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE FEW IF ANY SHIPPERS ARE TRULY CAPTIVE TO RAILS
47ac0309 THE BEST CASE IS MADE BY ELECTRIC UTILITIES THAT HAVE POWER PLANTS SERVED BY COAL HAULING ROADS BUT BIG UTILITIES DON'T LACK BARGAINING POWER
47ac030a FOR ONE THING THE STAGGERS ACT NOW ALLOWS LONG TERM CONTRACTS BETWEEN SHIPPERS AND RAILROADS
47ac030b THAT INCREDIBLY WAS NOT ALLOWED UNDER THE OLD LAW BECAUSE CONGRESS HAD ONCE DECIDED THAT VOLUME DISCOUNTS TO BIG SHIPPERS WERE UNFAIR
47ac030c IN DRAWING UP CONTRACTS THE RELEVANT FACT IS THAT BOTH THE RAILROAD AND THE UTILITY NEED EACH OTHER
47ac030d SOME UTILITIES PARTICULARLY IN THE WEST HAVE SURPLUS CAPACITY MEANING THEY CAN SWITCH TO OTHER SOURCES IF HAULING COSTS AT A SINGLE PLANT RISE
47ac030e <NOISE> DURING TESTIMONY IN APRIL FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION CHAIRMAN DANIEL OLIVER SAID THE LEGISLATION WOULD RESTRAIN COMPETITION
47ac030f HE ARGUED THAT SELLING DRUGS POSES NO CONFLICT OF INTEREST FOR PHYSICIANS
47ac030g THE COMMISSION ALSO HAS URGED STATE LEGISLATURES TO OPPOSE SIMILAR MEASURES
47ac030h WHEN THE MARKET WAS ROARING IT WAS STUPID TO HAVE CASH SAYS THE FUND MANAGER AT A MAJOR JAPANESE TRUST BANK
47ac030i BUT NOW IT ISN'T SO BAD
47ac030j AND MR. SALOMON'S MR. NAPIER SAYS EVERYONE IS GETTING INTO CASH RIGHT NOW AND WAITING
47ac030k BOND TRADERS WERE ALSO CHEERED BY ANOTHER DROP IN OIL FUTURES PRICES THE SEVENTH DECLINE IN THE PAST EIGHT SESSIONS
47ac030l THE DROP HAS INDICATED TO SOME ANALYSTS THAT INFLATION FEARS WERE GREATLY EXAGGERATED
47ac030m PREVIOUSLY OIL PRICES HAD SURGED ABOVE TWENTY TWO DOLLARS A BARREL LARGELY ON FEAR THAT GROWING TENSION IN THE PERSIAN GULF <NOISE> MIGHT LEAD TO A S- DISRUPTION OF OIL SUPPLIES
47ac030n <NOISE> IT ALSO INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD OF DEFECTIONS FROM HILL SAMUEL'S ONE HUNDRED THIRTY MEMBER CORPORATE FINANCE GROUP <NOISE> ACCORDING TO INSIDERS AND OFFICIALS OF OTHER BANKS
47ac030o AS PART OF T. S. B. THE DEPARTMENT MAINLY WOULD SERVE SMALL COMPANIES IN THE UNITED KINGDOM
47ac030p MANY MEMBERS OF THE TEAM HAD SOUGHT AN ALLIANCE WITH A LARGER GLOBAL PARTNER
47ac030q UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE THEY HAD THOUGHT THE OPERATION WOULD BE SOLD TO BARCLAYS BANK P. L. C.
47ac030r PROTESTERS IN BANGLADESH FOUGHT POLICE AND POLITICAL OPPONENTS AFTER VOTING RESUMED IN LOCAL ELECTIONS
47ac030s FOUR PEOPLE WERE REPORTED KILLED AND MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED WERE INJURED
47ac030t THE VOTING FOR LOCAL COUNCIL SEATS BEGAN FEBRUARY TENTH BUT ELECTION A- VIOLENCE KILLED AT LEAST ONE HUNDRED PEOPLE AND OFFICIALS POSTPONED THE BALLOTING
47ac030u <NOISE> VOTING HAD RESUMED ON SATURDAY
47ac030v THE GOVERNMENT IS NOW PORING OVER SEOW'S FINANCIAL AFFAIRS ASKING HOW HE'S BEEN PAYING HIS PHONE BILLS THESE PAST TEN YEARS
47ac030w SIMILAR INQUIRIES LED TO THE EXPULSION FROM PARLIAMENT LAST DECEMBER OF JOSHUA B. JEYARETNAM LEAVING ONLY ONE OPPOSITION M. P.
47ac030x <NOISE> A TEAM CANDIDATE PROPOSAL NOW UNDER STUDY WOULD ALSO SEEM LIKELY TO KEEP THE OPPOSITION FROM FINDING ITS WAY INTO GOVERNMENT OFFICE
47ac030y BUT SINGAPORE'S TWO POINT SIX MILLION CITIZENS AREN'T LIKELY TO BENEFIT QUITE SO MUCH AS THE POLITICIANS OF MR. LEE'S RULING PARTY
47ac030z COTTON FUTURES PRICES FOR COTTON FROM THE CURRENT CROP ROSE ON BUYING MOSTLY BY TRADERS WHO FOLLOW CHART SIGNALS
47ac0310 THE ADVANCE IN TURN PULLED UP PRICES OF DELIVERY MONTHS REPRESENTING THE NEW CROP SEASON WHICH WILL BEGIN AUGUST THE FIRST
47ac0311 THE JULY DELIVERY ROSE ONE POINT FIFTY NINE CENTS A POUND TO SIXTY FOUR POINT FORTY EIGHT CENTS
47ac0312 THE OCTOBER CONTRACT WAS UP ZERO POINT FIFTY EIGHT CENT TO SIXTY POINT THIRTY SIX CENTS A POUND
47ac0313 ONE ANALYST OBSERVED THAT NEW CROP CONTRACTS WERE UNDER PRESSURE EARLIER IN THE DAY BECAUSE OF THE PERCEPTION THAT MOISTURE IN THE MISSISSIPPI DELTA MIGHT BE HEAVIER THAN NEEDED
47ac0314 BUT LATER IN THE SESSION TRADERS CHANGED THEIR MINDS HE SAID DECIDING THAT RAIN MIGHT NOT BE ADEQUATE
47ac0315 HE SCORED A BIG TRIUMPH EARLY THIS YEAR PUSHING ASIDE LOCAL BUREAUCRATS WHO WANTED TO SHARE HIS SPOILS IN A ONE BILLION DOLLAR FREEWAY BEING BUILT IN GUANGDONG PROVINCE
47ac0316 HIS WEAPON THE PERSONAL BLESSING OF COMMUNIST PARTY GENERAL SECRETARY ZHAO ZIYANG
47ac0317 AT THE APRIL OPENING OF THE F:IVE HUNDRED TWELVE POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR GUANGDONG POWER PLANT OFFICIALDOM HEAPED PRAISE ON MR. WU FOR BEATING A CONSTRUCTION DEADLINE
47ac0318 INDONESIA AND THE PHILIPPINES ARE SO IMPRESSED THAT THEY HAVE ASKED HIM TO BUILD SIMILAR PLANTS
47ac0319 MANY ADMIRERS BELIEVE FIRMLY THAT IF ANYONE CAN GET BUSINESS DONE IN CHINA MR. WU CAN
47ac031a TO BEGIN WITH COMPANIES HAVE BEEN DOING A GOOD JOB OF MANAGING INVENTORIES
47ac031b IN THE PAST BUSINESSES HAVE TENDED TO BECOME INCREASINGLY OPTIMISTIC AS EXPANSIONS PERSISTED
47ac031c WHEN SALES EVENTUALLY SLOWED INVENTORIES QUICKLY REACHED EXCESSIVE LEVELS
47ac031d COMPANIES THEREUPON CUT THEIR BUYING INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION DECLINED AND A RECESSION WAS UNDER WAY
47ac031e ONE OF THE AFFINITY CARDS THAT CHEMICAL BANK DROPPED WAS MARKETED TO EL- ALUMNI OF NEW YORK UNIVERSITY
47ac031f WE WERE SATISFIED WITH THE PROGRAM WHILE IT WAS RUNNING SAYS ROBERT CUNNINGHAM DIRECTOR OF ALUMNI RELATIONS AT N. Y. U.
47ac031g <NOISE> BUT IT ENDED AT CHEMICAL'S SUGGESTION
47ac0401 <NOISE> OCCIDENTAL OFFICALS SAY THE MINE WILL START COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS NEXT SEPTEMBER MORE THAN TWO YEARS BEHIND SCHEDULE <NOISE>
47ac0402 <NOISE> THE MINE IS EXPECTED TO PRODUCE BETWEEN W- THIRTEEN MILLION AND THIRTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION TONS OF STEAMING COAL ANNUALLY USED AT ELECTRIC GENERATING PLANTS SAYS MR. OGDEN
47ac0403 ALL BUT TEN PERCENT OF THE OUTPUT IS FOR EXPORT MOSTLY TO JAPAN SOUTH KOREA AND HONG KONG
47ac0404 SO FAR ILLEGAL FOREIGN WORKERS AREN'T TAKEN AS A JOB THREAT BY JAPANESE WORKERS
47ac0405 BUT JAPANESE UNEMPLOYMENT IS AT HISTORICALLY HIGH LEVELS BECAUSE OF THE YEN'S STRENGTH POSING A KNOTTY PROBLEM FOR THE GOVERNMENT
47ac0406 MANY JAPANESE COMPANIES IN SUCH INDUSTRIES AS STEEL AND SHIPBUILDING ARE CUTTING THEIR LABOR FORCES
47ac0407 BROKERAGE STOCKS HAVE BEEN WILTING FOR MONTHS BUT MR. CHANOS THINKS THEY COULD GET HIT LATER THIS YEAR IF OTHER FIRMS REPORT DOWN QUARTERS
47ac0408 SALOMON'S STOCK DIVED ELEVEN PERCENT ON HUGE VOLUME MONDAY CASTING A TEMPORARY PALL OVER THE WHOLE GROUP
47ac0409 IT CLOSED YESTERDAY AT THIRTY NINE AND SEVEN EIGHTHS UP ONE EIGHTH
47ac040a THE BRODERICK MEN ARE ATTRACTED TO LEAH BECAUSE SHE IS AN HONEST WOMAN IN A WORLD OF PRETENSE AND ARTIFICE
47ac040b <NOISE> SHE CAN MANIPULATE IDEOLOGY AND IMAGE TO FURTHER RADICAL CAUSES BUT SHE DOESN'T CONFUSE HER POLITICAL STRATAGEMS WITH REALITY
47ac040c <NOISE> INDEED SHE HAS NO PERSONAL DEVOTION TO THOSE CAUSES THEY ARE SIMPLY VEHICLES FOR HER PROFESSIONAL SKILLS
47ac040d THIS FASCINATES AND BAFFLES THE MEN AROUND HER
47ac040e ANOTHER REASON MR. SOIFER IS AVOIDING MORGAN AND CITICORP IS THAT THEIR STOCK PRICES AT TIMES HAVE TENDED TO GYRATE MORE VIOLENTLY THAN OTHER BANK ISSUES
47ac040f CITICORP AND MORGAN TEND TO HAVE MORE VOLATILITY ON DAYS WHEN PROGRAM TRADING IS KNOWN TO OCCUR MR. SOIFER SAYS
47ac040g THEY'RE MORE OF A BET ON WHICH WAY THE MARKET IS HEADED
47ac040h <NOISE> ALTHOUGH OPEC HAS TOYED WITH VOLUNTARY QUOTAS FOR SEVERAL YEARS IT REALLY DIDN'T BECOME SERIOUS ABOUT PRODUCTION CURBS UNTIL AFTER LAST YEAR'S COLLAPSE IN OIL PRICES
47ac040i <NOISE> MEMBER COUNTRIES CONTINUE TO ARGUE HOWEVER OVER THE FAIRNESS OF THEIR NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN QUOTAS AND EACH HAS REASON TO REPORT LESS THAN IT IS PRODUCING
47ac040j <NOISE> THE PROBLEM SAYS A SENIOR OPEC OFFICIAL IS THAT RIGID QUOTAS ARE INCOMPATIBLE WITH A FLEXIBLE OIL MARKET <NOISE>
47ac040k WITH ONE EAR LAURA SLOATE LISTENS TO A MAN READING HEADLINES FROM SIX NEWSPAPERS
47ac040l <NOISE> WITH THE OTHER EAR SHE MONITORS AN AIDE READING HER MAIL
47ac040m MEANWHILE SHE IS KEEPING UP A CONVERSATION SORT OF
47ac040n CORRESPONDENT BANKING OR PROVIDING SERVICES TO SMALLER BANKS IS ONE AREA THAT MANUFACTURERS MIGHT LEAVE
47ac040o <NOISE> THE PROFITABILITY OF THAT BUSINESS HAS BEEN DECLINING FOR YEARS MR. WOODEN SAID
47ac040p <NOISE> IT WAS THROUGH THESE CORRESPONDENT BANKS THAT MANUFACTURERS GOT ALL OF THESE ENERGY LOANS THAT HAVE SOURED
47ac040q HOWEVER ONE MANUFACTURERS EXECUTIVE SAID HE DOUBTED CORRESPONDENT BANKING WOULD BE ELIMINATED IN LIGHT OF THAT BUSINESS'S IMPROVED PERFORMANCE RECENTLY
47ac040r THE POINT A POINT MR. CAMPBELL KEEPS RETURNING TO IS THAT EVERY RELIGION IS TRUE
47ac040s <NOISE> IT'S TRUE AS A METAPHOR FOR THE HUMAN AND COSMIC MYSTERIES
47ac040t IT'S ONLY WHEN YOU'RE STUCK ON THE METAPHOR THAT YOU GET IN TROUBLE
47ac040u MR. SMITH SAID TRADING IN BRITISH AEROSPACE SHARES WOULD RESUME EARLY TODAY ON LONDON'S STOCK EXCHANGE
47ac040v TRADING WAS SUSPENDED AT FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY PENCE OR SEVEN DOLLARS NINETY F:IVE CENTS WEDNESDAY
47ac040w ANALYSTS PREDICTED EARLY YESTERDAY THAT THE SHARES WOULD FALL WHEN TRADING RESUMED WHATEVER THE OUTCOME OF NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE E. C. <NOISE> AND BRITISH GOVERNMENT
47ac040x PROCESSORS BLAME THEIR SUPPLIERS
47ac040y CARGILL INCORPORATED A MAJOR CORN SYRUP MAKER SAYS IT IS PAYING COOPERATIVES FARMERS AND ELEVATORS MORE FOR THEIR CORN
47ac040z <NOISE> A SPOKESMAN SAYS SELLERS KNOW THEY CAN GO TO OTHER BUYERS
47ac0410 WE DON'T HAVE ANY GROWERS IN OUR POCKET
47ac0411 CARGILL CAN'T SET PRICES
47ac0412 AS FOR THE PRICES CARGILL CHARGES HE ADDS WE'RE TRYING TO GET THE MAXIMUM PRICE FOR OUR PRODUCTS ALL THE TIME
47ac0413 VIEWERS AND CRITICS SAY THE HUGE LOAD OF ADS AND AIRTIME IS PART OF THE PROBLEM
47ac0414 COMMERCIAL CLUTTER SEEMS GREATER THAN IN PREVIOUS OLYMPICS BROADCASTS MANY CRITICS SAY
47ac0415 THE COVERAGE BETWEEN ADS SOME COMPLAIN IS FRAGMENTED AND SHIFTY JUMPING TOO QUICKLY AMONG MYRIAD SPORTS

47cc030p <NOISE> DAVID HOCKNEY HAS BEEN A KIND OF WUNDERKIND ON THE INTERNATIONAL ART SCENE SINCE HE BURST UPON IT IN HIS NATIVE BRITAIN IN THE LATE NINETEEN FIFTIES
47cc030q HE IS NOW FIFTY YEARS OLD AND THIS MID CAREER RETROSPECTIVE <NOISE> AT THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY MUSEUM MAKES CLEAR ONCE AGAIN HOW PRECOCIOUS AND PROLIFIC HE HAS BEEN
47cc030r IN FACT THE PROFUSION AND VARIETY OF MR. HOCKNEY'S WORK SEEMS TO HAVE GIVEN THE SHOW'S ORGANIZERS SOME PROBLEMS WITH ITS PRESENTATION
47cc030s <NOISE> FOR ALTHOUGH MR. HOCKNEY'S TALENT AND ORIGINALITY ARE GENERALLY ACKNOWLEDGED HE IS REGARDED IN SOME QUARTERS AS MORE OF A GIFTED ILLUSTRATOR THAN A MAJOR ARTIST
47cc030t AND SINCE IN RECENT YEARS HIS WORK HAS TENDED TO BE INCREASINGLY DECORATIVE A CHRONOLOGICAL ARRANGEMENT WAS APPARENTLY THOUGHT TO BE TOO RISKY
47cc030u THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION *EXCORIATED* DANIEL ORTEGA FOR HIS UNWILLINGNESS TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE CONTRAS
47cc030v IT CONTINUES TO QUIBBLE WITH PRETORIA FOR IG- IGNORING THE AFRICAN NATIONAL CONGRESS
47cc030w <NOISE> BUT IN A REMARKABLE DEMONSTRATION OF INCONSISTENCY IT NOT ONLY APPLAUDS ISRAEL'S DEAFNESS TO THE P. L. O. <NOISE> IT STUFFS LEGISLATIVE PLUGS IN ITS OWN EARS AS WELL
47cc030x CERTAIN ELEMENTS OF A NATIONAL SYSTEM WERE OBVIOUS AND QUICKLY MADE THEIR WAY INTO USE
47cc030y THE FIRST WAS A COMPOSITE TAPE THAT BROUGHT INFORMATION FROM VARIOUS MARKET CENTERS ONTO ONE TICKER TAPE
47cc030z A COMPOSITE QUOTATION DISPLAY SYSTEM SOON FOLLOWED ALLOWING CUSTOMERS AND BROKERS TO SEE QUOTES FROM ALL MARKETS ON A SINGLE SCREEN
47cc0310 AND AN INTERMARKET TRADING SYSTEM ALLOWED ORDERS COMING TO VARIOUS EXCHANGE FLOORS TO FLOW FROM ONE EXCHANGE TO ANOTHER QUICKLY EASILY AND AT NO COST

47cc0313 HE ADDED THAT A. T. AND T. PLANS TO INCORPORATE INTO ITS UNIX ANY USEFUL FEATURES FROM ITS RIVALS' VERSION
47cc0314 <NOISE> FOR A. B. C. NOW NUMBER TWO A HIT WITH ROSEANNE COULD MEAN A TURNING POINT
47cc0315 PRODUCER MARCY CARSEY SAYS SHE HAS THE SAME FEELING IN HER GUT AS SHE HAD BEFORE THE DEBUT OF COSBY
47cc0316 BUT THERE THE SIMILARITY ENDS
47cc0317 THE COSBY SHOW'S CLARE HUXTABLE IS A LOVING LAWYER AND MATRIARCH IN A TWO HUNDRED DOLLAR SWEATER
47cc0318 ROSEANNE IS AN ACID TONGUED ASSEMBLY LINE WORKER IN AN OLD SWEATSHIRT

47cc031c INDONESIA AND THE PHILIPPINES ARE SO IMPRESSED THAT THEY HAVE ASKED HIM TO BUILD SIMILAR PLANTS

47cc0401 CHICAGO CENTRAL AND PACIFIC IS ONE OF A SLEW OF NEW RAILROADS THAT ARE BEING CREATED AS MAJOR RAILROADS SELL HA- LIGHTLY USED TRACKS

47cc0403 MOST ARE SHORT LINES WITH FEWER THAN ONE HUNDRED MILES AND SOME ARE MUCH LONGER REGIONAL LINES OF MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED MILES
47cc0404 THE STATE SETS THE OFFICIAL RATE CURRENTLY TWO HUNDRED ZLOTYS TO THE DOLLAR
47cc0405 IT SETS THE PRICE OF VODKA NOW ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED ZLOTYS
47cc0406 <NOISE> THE STATE DOESN'T RUN THE BLACK MARKET OF COURSE
47cc0407 BUT ITS POLICE DON'T BREAK THE BIG RINGS EITHER <NOISE>
47cc0408 THEY SEEM CONTENT TO LET THE POLES TRADE THEIR LETTUCE
47cc0409 SOONER OR LATER PEWEX WILL GET MOST OF IT ANYWAY
47cc040a ALL INDICATIONS SUGGEST THOUGH THAT THE REAGAN NAKASONE SUMMIT WILL NOT BE ABOUT MONETARY POLICIES
47cc040b THEY WILL DISCUSS TRADE ISSUES WHICH ARE CERTAINLY IMPORTANT BUT RATHER REMOTE FROM THE IMMEDIATE PROBLEM
47cc040c ALL OF THE WORLD'S EXPORTS AND IMPORTS COME TO ABOUT TWO TRILLION A YEAR
47cc040d BUT FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET TRADING AMOUNTS TO ABOUT ONE TRILLION A WEEK
47cc040e <NOISE> IT IS IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS THAT THE BATTLE OF THE DOLLAR WILL HAVE TO BE FOUGHT
47cc040f THE F. C. C. REJECTED PETITIONS FROM SEVERAL PARTIES MAINTAINING THAT THE STATIONS SHOULD BE SOLD TO SOMEONE <NOISE> WITH CLOSER TIES TO THE HISPANIC COMMUNITY THAN HALLMARK

47cc040h THE F. C. C. SAID THE CONCERNS OVER FUTURE PROGRAMMING WERE IRRELEVANT TO THE TRANSFER
47cc040i <NOISE> A PAINSTAKINGLY CRAFTED FEDERAL BLUEPRINT ENVISAGED STATES CLUSTERING INTO A DOZEN OR SO REGIONAL COMPACTS EACH WITH ITS OWN DISPOSAL *SITE*
47cc040j BUT STATES HAVE RUN INTO ENORMOUS POLITICAL ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC OBSTACLES IN TRYING TO PUT TOGETHER THESE AGREEMENTS
47cc040k NOR HAVE STATES HAD MUCH LUCK IN CONVINCING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT HOSTING A DISPOSAL SITE <NOISE> FOR EVEN THE MORE BENIGN VARIETIES OF NUCLEAR REFUSE CAN BE SAFE AND EVEN PROFITABLE
47cc040l XEROX IN MARCH ANNOUNCED ITS DECISION TO SELL ITS FIFTY ONE PERCENT OWNED RANK XEROX UNIT BECAUSE OF SOUTH AFRICA'S POLICIES OF RACIAL SEGREGATION

47cc040x THE U. S. SUGGESTED THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT AWARD THE PRIVATE TERMINAL CONTRACTS ONLY TO JAPANESE FIRMS THAT PROMISE TO USE FOREIGN SUBCONTRACTORS
47cc040y BUT THAT DIDN'T WORK
47cc040z JAPANESE COMPANIES PREFER TO DIVIDE THE WORK THAN COMPETE FOR IT
47cc0410 PLUNGING INTO A MARKET MOST INVESTORS ARE STRUGGLING TO ESCAPE HENLEY SPENDS SIX HUNDRED MILLION
47cc0411 FOR TEN DAYS IT BUYS TWO OUT OF EVERY THREE SANTA FE SHARES TRADED AND LIFTS ITS STAKE TO FOURTEEN PERCENT FROM FIVE PERCENT
47cc0412 SANTA FE DOESN'T MAKE A MOVE WHICH MR. DINGMAN TAKES AS A SIGN OF WEAKNESS
47cc0413 IF I WERE IN THEIR SHOES I'D BE BUYING MY DAMNED STOCK HE ARGUES
47cc0414 <NOISE> AS JAPAN'S FINANCIAL MARKETS HAVE GROWN AND BECOME MORE INTERNATIONAL SO HAS FOREIGN PRESSURE ON JAPAN TO CLEAN UP WHAT MANY PERCEIVE AS UNFAIR TRADING PRACTICES
47cc0415 AS A START JAPAN REVISED ITS SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE LAW LAST MAY
47cc0416 NOW THE FINANCE MINISTRY IS WRITING THE DEFINITIONS AND GUIDELINES THAT WILL GIVE THE NEW LAW MUSCLE WHEN IT GOES INTO EFFECT NEXT APRIL
47cc0417 AND JOURNALISTS SECURITIES ANALYSTS AND SOME CORPORATE OFFICIALS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE MINISTRY'S FIRST DRAFT
47cc0418 IN A RELATED MATTER A REVIEW COMMISSION ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE ON OCTOBER EIGHTEENTH THREW OUT O:SHA CITATIONS AGAINST MORRELL
47cc0419 THE CITATIONS ISSUED IN APRIL NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN CHARGED RECORD KEEPING VIOLATIONS
47cc041a THE OFFICIAL DISALLOWED OSHA'S INSTANCE BY INSTANCE CITATION WHICH PROPOSED A TOTAL FINE OF SIX HUNDRED AND NINETY THOUSAND
47cc041b THE OFFICIAL ALSO SAID OSHA DIDN'T ISSUE THE CITATION WITHIN THE SIX MONTHS SPECIFIED BY LAW FROM THE TIME AN OFFICIAL INSPECTION BEGINS
47dc0201 INDEED TO INVESTORS ALL SHARES OF THE SAME STOCK ARE ALIKE THE INVESTOR DOESN'T CARE WHICH ONE HE BUYS
47dc0202 BUT TWO EXAMPLES OF THE SAME STAMP ISSUE CAN DIFFER GREATLY IN VALUE DEPENDING ON THE QUALITY OF SAY PERFORATIONS INK OR GLUE
47dc0203 BUYING STAMPS THROUGH A COMPUTER NETWORK SIGHT UNSEEN COULD BE HAZARDOUS
47dc0204 AFTER U. S. WARPLANES STRUCK LIBYA LAST APRIL RICHARD ROBINSON DROPPED PLANS FOR A TWO WEEK VACATION IN FRANCE AND IRELAND FEARING AN INCREASE IN TERRORISM

47dc020b EACH EMBASSY COMPLEX HAD TO BE OCCUPIED SIMULTANEOUSLY
47dc020c <NOISE> CONSTRUCTION OF THE SOVIET UNION'S WASHINGTON EMBASSY WAS COMPLETED BY NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE <NOISE> BEFORE WORK ON THE U. S.'S NEW MOSCOW EMBASSY HAD EVEN STARTED

47dc020e AS THE U. S. BUILDINGS WERE COMPLETED IN MOSCOW <NOISE> THE SOVIETS WERE ALLOWED TO MOVE INTO SOME OF THEIR NEW FACILITIES ON MOUNT ALTO
47dc020f ONLY THE MAIN AMBASSADORIAL BUILDINGS AT EACH SITE ARE VACANT

47dc020h THE PEOPLE OF EL BARILLO ARE UNDER THE BOOT
47dc020i THEY'VE BEEN SMART ENOUGH TO SURVIVE

47dc020k <NOISE> GRAINS AND SOYBEANS PRICES WERE MIXED AMID RESISTANCE TO TRADING IN TANDEM WITH FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND METALS
47dc020l LACK OF FARMER SELLING AND FEARS OF A HOT DRY SUMMER BOOSTED SOYBEAN FUTURES
47dc020m <NOISE> THE STRENGTH IN THE SOYBEAN CONTRACT FOR DELIVERY AFTER THE HARVEST HELPED SEPTEMBER CORN RISE SLIGHTLY AS DID WORRIES ABOUT THE SUMMER WEATHER
47dc020n <NOISE> WHEAT FUTURES WERE MIXED
47dc020o <NOISE> MR. HOLMES A COURT ALSO FILED WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION SEEKING CLEARANCE TO BOOST HIS STAKE ABOVE TEN PERCENT
47dc020p SUCH A FILING IS REQUIRED UNDER ANTITRUST LAW IF AN INVESTOR WISHES TO INCREASE HIS HOLDINGS ABOVE THAT LEVEL
47dc020q <NOISE> IF HIS REQUEST IS GRANTED HE AND HIS GROUP COULD BUY AS MUCH AS FIFTEEN PERCENT OF TEXACO
47dc020r A PURCHASE OF MORE THAN FIFTEEN PERCENT WOULD REQUIRE ANOTHER FILING WITH THE AGENCIES
47dc020s HE HELPED US TO LOOK AT THE DIFFERENT OPTIONS SAYS ALFRED S. WARREN THE G. M. VICE PRESIDENT LEADING THE NEGOTIATIONS UNDER MR. JOHNSON
47dc020t HE WAS VERY REFRESHING IN SOME OF HIS THOUGHTS AND IDEAS
47dc020u BUT THE IDEAS NEVER BECAME REALITY
47dc020v G. M. EVENTUALLY SIGNED A TRADITIONAL PACT PATTERNED CLOSELY AFTER FORD'S
47dc020w IN A RECENT PAPER PRESENTED TO FELLOW LOBBYISTS MISS FARTHING EXPLAINED HOW TO GET LEVERAGE FROM SUCH A PROGRAM

47dc0217 BIDS ON THAT ARE DUE IN MID APRIL
47dc0218 DOCTOR ZAGURY SAID HIS VACCINE SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A PROTOTYPE FOR TESTING BUT WHETHER IT CONFERS PROTECTION AGAINST AIDS HASN'T BEEN PROVED
47dc0219 THE ULTIMATE TEST OF *EFFICACY* EXPOSING THE VACCINATED SUBJECTS TO THE LIVE AIDS VIRUS HASN'T BEEN DONE FOR ETHICAL REASONS
47dc021a HOWEVER THE NEXT STEP IS TO TEST A VACCINE IN A LARGE GROUP OF VOLUNTEERS WHO ARE AT HIGH RISK OF BEING EXPOSED TO THE VIRUS
47dc021b DOCTOR ZAGURY SAID HE IS TRYING TO STREAMLINE HIS BOOSTER PROCEDURE TO MAKE IT MORE WIDELY APPLICABLE
47dc021c ODDLY AND SADLY NEITHER CANDIDATE HAS TALKED MUCH ABOUT THIS ISSUE
47dc021d <NOISE> MAYBE IT DOESN'T LEND ITSELF TO SLOGANS
47dc021e MAYBE MESSRS.
47dc021f BUSH AND DUKAKIS THINK THAT LIKE TAXES IT CRIPPLED WALTER MONDALE FOUR YEARS AGO
47dc021g MAYBE IT'S AN ISSUE THE CANDIDATES HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT
47dc0301 WE HAVE A SERIOUS BUSINESS SITUATION BECAUSE OF THE YEN'S APPRECIATION AND TRADE FRICTION <NOISE> AN OFFICIAL OF BROTHER INDUSTRIES SAYS
47dc0302 <NOISE> IN MID NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN THE COMPANY WILL BEGIN MAKING ELECTRONIC TYPEWRITERS IN BARTLETT TENNESSEE

47dc0304 <NOISE> IN ADDITION TO THE WAR OF NERVES OVER DISCOUNTS RETAIL EXECUTIVES SAID THIS CHRISTMAS SEASON HAS BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY THE ABSENCE OF A BIG HIT IN THE TOY DEPARTMENT
47dc0305 <NOISE> BUT RETAILERS HAVE SEEN STRONG SALES OF BIG TICKET ITEMS TO WELL HEELED CUSTOMERS
47dc0306 <NOISE> THEY ARE BUYING TO BEAT THE NEW TAX LAW WHICH WILL END THE DEDUCTION OF SALES TAXES AND SOME INTEREST EXPENSES
47dc0307 <NOISE> BALLY'S DRIVE INTO THE HOTEL CASINO INDUSTRY HAS MADE HEALTH CLUBS AN INCREASINGLY AWKWARD FIT ANALYSTS SAID <NOISE> AND THUS THE MOST LIKELY CANDIDATE FOR DIVESTITURE
47dc0308 <NOISE> BY SHEDDING THE HEALTH CLUB LINE BALLY COULD FOCUS ON ITS REMAINING OPERATIONS GAMBLING MACHINES STATE LOTTERIES AND AMUSEMENT CENTERS
47dc0309 <NOISE> ANALYSTS ALSO QUESTION THE FIT OF THE COMPANY'S THEME PARKS THOUGH SAYING A SALE OF THAT OPERATION COULD FOLLOW
47dc030a THE NEW POLICY ISN'T CLEARLY DELINEATED
47dc030b IT STIPULATES THAT NO NEW DEFENSE CONTRACT WILL BE SIGNED

47dc030h JUSTICE *LEWIS* POWELL ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO CASE OF EDGAR VERSUS
47dc030i <NOISE> M. I. T. E. SUGGESTED THAT ANY STATE LAW THAT FAVORED TARGETS MORE THAN DID THE WILLIAMS ACT WOULD BE INVALID BECAUSE CONGRESS HAD PREEMPTED LOCAL REGULATIONS
47dc030j THE COURT BACKTRACKED HERE TO SAY STATE LAWS MIGHT BE O. K. IF THEY HELP THE WILLIAM ACT'S PURPOSE BY HEAPING EVEN MORE BURDENS ON ACQUIRERS
47dc030k <NOISE> THE SYSTEM ISN'T A HUNDRED PERCENT PERFECT BUT IT'S WORKING REASONABLY WELL A FOREIGN MINISTRY OFFICIAL TOLD REPORTERS
47dc030l THE OFFICIAL SAID THE U. S. HAS BEEN SIMILARLY REASSURED
47dc030m <NOISE> EVEN SO THE U. S. HAS INDICATED THAT IT WANTS JAPAN TO TAKE BETTER CARE OF HOW JAPANESE TECHNOLOGY IS SOLD AROUND THE WORLD
47dc030n <NOISE> ANOTHER INCENTIVE THAT FOOD PROCESSORS CITE FOR GETTING INTO THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS IS THE HIGH COST OF INTRODUCING NEW GROCERY ITEMS
47dc030o STARTING A NEW BRAND CAN EASILY COST GENERAL MILLS MORE THAN TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN DEVELOPMENT AND PROMOTION COSTS
47dc030p <NOISE> OF COURSE THE OLIVE GARDEN START UP BRICK AND MORTAR AND ALL HAS COST FIVE TIMES THAT
47dc030q <NOISE> PRATT AND WHITNEY SAID LAST WEEK IT MIGHT LAY OFF EMPLOYEES AFTER THE FIRST OF THE YEAR BECAUSE OF DECREASED DEMAND FOR JET ENGINES AND PARTS
47dc030r THE COMPANY DECLINED TO DISCUSS HOW MANY EMPLOYEES MIGHT BE LAID OFF OR IF THE LOSS WOULD BE PERMANENT OR TEMPORARY
47dc030s BUT UNION OFFICIALS SAID THE COMPANY HAS TOSSED AROUND NUMBERS FROM ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED TO TWO THOUSAND
47dc030t <NOISE> AS A RESULT THE GOVERNMENT IS TALKING OF HIGHER FARM PRICES
47dc030u BUT HIGHER FARM PRICES WOULD ADD TO AN ALREADY STEEP INFLATION RATE
47dc030v <NOISE> SO BEIJING OFFICIALS REPORTEDLY TALK OF TYING WAGES TO INFLATION AN IDEA REMINISCENT OF THE WAGE INDEXATION TRIED IN SOME LATIN AMERICAN NATIONS SEVERAL YEARS AGO WITH DISASTROUS RESULTS
47dc030w BUT U. S. MANUFACTURERS WHO TOOK A BEATING DURING THE FIRST HALF OF THIS DECADE CONTINUE TO ENJOY A ROARING REVIVAL THAT BEGAN LAST YEAR
47dc030x AS A RESULT THERE IS GROWING EVIDENCE THAT FACTORY WAGE AND PRICE INCREASES ARE ACCELERATING
47dc030y <NOISE> AND THAT COULD LEAD THE FED TO BOOST INTEREST RATES IN AN EFFORT TO COOL DOWN THE ECONOMY IN THE COMING MONTHS
47dc030z TO BE SURE A FEW COMPANIES ARE TRYING TO USE THE OLYMPICS TO MAKE THE TRANSITION FROM A SUBCONTRACTOR TO AN INTERNATIONALLY KNOWN BRAND
47dc0310 <NOISE> KUKJE CORPORATION SHIFTED FROM PRODUCING NIKE SHOES TO DEVELOPING ITS OWN PRO SPECS LINE OF ATHLETIC SHOES FIVE YEARS AGO

47dc0315 MANY FAMILIES THAT COULD WHITE OR BLACK FLED TO SUBURBAN PRIVATE OR PAROCHIAL SCHOOLS <NOISE> HAS BUSING ALONE BECAME A MORE DISCUSSED ISSUE THAN SCHOOL CURRICULA
47dc0316 WITH A FEW EXCEPTIONS SUCH AS YONKERS AND KANSAS CITY FEDERAL JUDGES HAVE LEARNED TO ESCHEW THEIR TRAGIC SOCIAL ENGINEERING
47dc0317 MOST NOW LEAVE SCHOOL SYSTEMS ALONE TO ATTRACT STUDENTS BACK NOT DRIVE THEM OUT
47dc0318 THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF RECESSION LIKE DEVELOPMENTS IN THESE STATISTICS SAID NORMAN ROBERTSON CHIEF ECONOMIST AT MELLON BANK CORPORATION
47dc0319 AS A RESULT HE SAID IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT THE FED IS GOING TO EASE AT THIS TIME
47dc031a UNDER THESE CONDITIONS THE FED WILL PROBABLY ADOPT A FAMILIAR WAIT AND SEE ATTITUDE
47dc031b SOME OF THAT CASH HAS BEEN USED FOR BONUS PAYMENTS
47dc031c WAGES AND BONUSES ROSE NINETEEN PERCENT IN THE FIRST HALF <NOISE> A RATE THAT FAR OUTPACED ECONOMIC GROWTH AND EXERTED UPWARD PRESSURE ON PRICES
47dc031d CHINA'S ECONOMY GREW AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF FIVE POINT SEVEN PERCENT IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS ROUGHLY HALF THE AVERAGE ANNUAL RATE IN THE PAST DECADE
47dc0401 THE REPORT DOESN'T INCLUDE PRESIDENT REAGAN'S OWN VERSION OF EVENTS

47dc0409 THE ONLY NOTICEABLE DECLINES WERE IN RESTAURANTS ZERO POINT SIX PERCENT AND FOOD STORES ZERO POINT THREE PERCENT
47dc040a EXCLUDING AUTOS SALES ROSE ZERO POINT FOUR PERCENT LAST MONTH
47dc040b IF WE LOOK AT THE RECORD THE DEBATE SHOULD BE RATHER SHORT
47dc040c <NOISE> THE WINNERS OBVIOUS
47dc040d THE ONLY TRAGEDY AND IT'S AN AMAZING ONE IS THAT MOST AMERICANS DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED AND HOW IT CAME ABOUT

47dc040m THE CARS WILL BE SOLD FIRST IN WEST GERMANY BELGIUM AUSTRIA THE NETHERLANDS AND SWITZERLAND
47dc040n THE ROAD NAMED WEST STREET IS A NARROW STRIP OF RED GRAVEL
47dc040o IT IS LIKE THE PROVERBIAL RAILROAD TRACKS IN AMERICA THAT SEPARATE THE RICH SIDE OF TOWN FROM THE POOR
47dc040p THE PHYSICAL DISTANCE MAY NOT BE GREAT BUT THE MENTAL GAP IS
47dc040q <NOISE> THE HONDURAN LEGISLATOR AGAIN <NOISE> I'M ALMOST CONVINCED THAT THE SANDINISTAS ARE GOING TO BE THERE FOREVER
47dc040r <NOISE> I THINK WE SHOULD GO INTO A PEACE PROCESS WITH THEM
47dc040s <NOISE> I DON'T SEE OURSELVES GOING INTO A WAR AND THE AMERICANS DON'T SEE THEMSELVES GOING INTO A VIETNAM TYPE WAR IN CENTRAL AMERICA
47dc040t SOME WONDER WHETHER ALL THE CONVERSIONS DON'T MAKE MR. BEREGOVOY MORE OF AN OPPORTUNIST THAN A BELIEVER IN THE MARKET ECONOMY
47dc040u BUT HIS AIDES SAY HE WAS CONVINCED HE WAS DOING THE RIGHT THING
47dc040v MR. BEREGOVOY SAID I'M NOT ASHAMED OF WHAT I DO
47dc040w THE PUBLIC FILINGS SHOW THAT A FIRM CALLED CAMRO ASSOCIATES ACQUIRED A ONE PERCENT NONVOTING STAKE IN SEEMALA IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR

47dc0415 THE OVERALL MARKET IS BEING DRIVEN BY THESE BIG CAP TAKEOVER STOCKS BUT I'M NOT PARTICIPATING
47dc0416 MR. TURNER MAY EVEN KNOW ALL THIS BECAUSE HIS PROTECTIONIST ARDOR IS QUITE RECENT

47ec0206 <NOISE> CONSIDERING THE STATE'S FLAT RELATIVELY EARTHQUAKE FREE LANDSCAPE MR. HAMMETT SAYS NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF TEXAS COULD HAVE THE SITE
47ec0207 THERE'S PROBABLY ALSO A PSYCHOLOGICAL SIDE TO AUGUSTA NATIONAL'S ACCENT ON EXPERIENCE
47ec0208 THE COLOR THAT'S SECOND ONLY TO GREEN HEREABOUTS IS GRAY
47ec0209 IT CAN BE FOUND MOSTLY ON THE HEADS OF PARTICIPANTS AND SPECTATORS

47ec020m <NOISE> SO FAR NO JUDGE HAS ATTEMPTED TO FIX AN ABSOLUTE CAP ON A GROUP OF CLAIMS AS HUGE AND UNCERTAIN AS THOSE FACING ROBINS
47ec020n ANOTHER REASON MR. SOIFER IS AVOIDING MORGAN AND CITICORP IS THAT THEIR STOCK PRICES AT TIMES HAVE TENDED TO GYRATE MORE VIOLENTLY THAN OTHER BANK ISSUES
47ec020o CITICORP AND MORGAN TEND TO HAVE MORE VOLATILITY ON DAYS WHEN PROGRAM TRADING IS KNOWN TO OCCUR MR. SOIFER SAYS
47ec020p <NOISE> THEY'RE MORE OF A BET ON WHICH WAY THE MARKET IS HEADED

47ec030a <NOISE> BUT ANALYSTS HAVE SPECULATED THAT EITHER FORD MOTOR COMPANY OR GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY MIGHT BE A GOOD FIT WITH BOEING IF THE COMPANIES WERE INTERESTED
47ec030b FORD FOR INSTANCE HAS INDICATED THAT IT IS LOOKING FOR ACQUISITIONS AND HAS ACCUMULATED ABOUT NINE BILLION DOLLARS IT COULD USE FOR SUCH PURPOSES
47ec030c A FORD SPOKESMAN CITING COMPANY POLICY WOULD NEITHER CONFIRM NOR DENY SPECULATION ABOUT ITS INTEREST

47fc020v <NOISE> STILL TRADERS WERE ENCOURAGED BY INVESTOR REACTION TO THIS WEEK'S TREASURY FINANCING ESPECIALLY YESTERDAY'S THIRTY YEAR BOND SALE

47fc0214 <NOISE> THE GRAND METROPOLITAN OPERATIONS WHICH WERE ACQUIRED BY THAT COMPANY IN NINETEEN EIGHTY HAVE ENJOYED A GOOD REPUTATION IN THE INDUSTRY
47fc0215 BUT PEPSICO FEELS ITS TERRITORIES CAN BE BETTER EXPLOITED DUE TO THEIR PROXIMITY TO EXISITING COMPANY OWNED BOTTLERS
47fc0216 IT OWNS ITS LOS ANGELES AND SAN FRANCISCO BOTTLERS FOR INSTANCE MAKING THE CENTRAL CALIFORNIA TERRITORY A GOOD FIT
47fc0217 IT ALSO ALREADY OWNS ITS BOTTLERS IN CENTRAL AND NORTHERN FLORIDA AND PARTS OF GEORGIA
47fc0218 THERE ARE SOME GREAT OPPORTUNITIES TO MAXIMIZE PRODUCTION AND MARKETING EFFICIENCIES THE PEPSICO SPOKESMAN SAID

47fc021d BUT SERVICE MERCHANDISE JUMPED ONE AND THREE EIGHTHS TO EIGHTEEN AND ONE QUARTER ON ONE POINT FOUR MILLION SHARES
47fc021e THE STOCK SLID TO TWELVE AND ONE QUARTER IN SEPTEMBER AFTER THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT AN INVESTOR GROUP HAD DECIDED NOT TO PROCEED WITH A POSSIBLE ACQUISITION OFFER

47fc0301 <NOISE> WHEN HU YAOBANG WAS DUMPED IN JANUARY AS THE COMMUNIST PARTY'S SECRETARY GENERAL MR. ZHAO WAS ELEVATED TO THAT POST ON AN ACTING BASIS
47fc0302 THAT MADE MR. ZHAO A PROTEGE OF DENG XIAOPING THE DE FACTO HEAD OF THE PARTY AS WELL AS THE GOVERNMENT
47fc0303 IT IS A DELICATE POSITION REQUIRING HIM TO MANEUVER AMONG VARIOUS INTEREST GROUPS AND PERSONAL CLIQUES THAT MAKE UP CHINA'S TOP LEADERSHIP

47hc0414 <NOISE> THE PRICE INCREASES ARE EXPECTED PRETTY MUCH ACROSS THE BOARD AS COMMODITIES AND SERVICES ARE RISING AT ABOUT A FOUR PERCENT ANNUAL RATE
47hc0415 BUT THERE IS ALWAYS THE RISK THAT REVIVING A CLASSIC SLOGAN OR SPOKESMAN WILL BACKFIRE AND CREATE AN OLD FASHIONED IMAGE FOR A BRAND
47hc0416 TO GUARD AGAINST THAT MARKETERS TEND TO GIVE THEIR RECYCLED ADS A CONTEMPORARY TWIST

47ic0312 MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN THE FORMER CATEGORY ARE EXPECTED TO EXTEND THE NO SELL AGREEMENT FOR ANOTHER YEAR HE SAID
47ic0313 <NOISE> THE LOWER VOLATILITY COULD BE ES!PECIALLY IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW WHEN THE COURSE OF INTEREST RATES SEEMS ESPECIALLY CLOUDY
47ic0314 WHILE INTEREST RATES HAVE BEEN DECLINING RECENTLY MANY ECONOMISTS EXPECT RATES TO RISE BY YEAR END

47ic0406 IT WAS THE BIG BOARD'S MOST ACTIVE ISSUE
47ic0407 DURING THE PAST SEVERAL DAYS CORPORATIONS AND OTHER BIG INVESTORS HAVE REFRAINED FROM LENDING TREASURY BONDS AND NOTES TO SECURITIES DEALERS FOR BRIEF PERIODS
47ic0408 THAT IN TURN HAS FORCED MANY DEALERS TO REFRAIN FROM SELLING BORROWED SECURITIES OR AMASSING SO CALLED SHORT POSITIONS

47ic040o CRITICIZING SHORTCOMINGS ISN'T ENOUGH
47ic040p WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE ACHIEVEMENTS
47ic040q <NOISE> WE HAVE TO DEVELOP JUDGMENT AND THAT ISN'T EASY

47ic0412 <NOISE> STORE OWNERS IT SAYS ARE LICENSEES BECAUSE THEY OWN THEIR STORES AND DON'T PAY ROYALTIES TO BENETTON AS FRANCHISEES TYPICALLY DO
47ic0413 ALTHOUGH IT ACKNOWLEDGES THAT A FEW STORE OWNERS HAVE COMPLAINED IT BLAMES ANY PROBLEMS ON THE OWNERS THEMSELVES OR ON ITS FIELD REPRESENTATIVES WHO DEAL DIRECTLY WITH THEM
47ic0414 DESPITE THE PROBLEMS WITH THE CLARIDGE MR. WYNN DIDN'T RULE OUT AN EVENTUAL RETURN TO THE ATLANTIC CITY GAMBLING SCENE
47ic0415 <NOISE> IT'S DISAPPOINTING HE SAID OF THE FAILED PROPOSAL

47ic041b THESE MIXED FEELINGS OF FRUSTRATION WITH AND GRATITUDE TOWARD THE AUTHORITIES ARE PART OF THE EVERYDAY LIFE OF A FOREIGNER DOING BUSINESS IN KOREA
47ic041c IN FACT SUCH CONTRADICTIONS ARE WHAT SEEM TO MAKE THE KOREAN WORLD GO ROUND
47ic041d A WESTERN BUSINESSMAN NEEDS TO BE READY FOR THEM
47ic041e HERE ARE A FEW HARD LEARNED FACTS OF KOREAN BUSINESS LIFE
47jc0201 MR. GRANT WAS TRAVELING AND UNAVAILABLE FOR COMMENT
47jc0202 OTHER OFFICIALS OF GRANT BROADCASTING AREN'T AUTHORIZED TO COMMENT ON ANY ASPECTS OF THE CASE AIDES TO MR. GRANT SAID
47jc0203 THE COMPANY'S BANKRUPTCY CASE LAWYER IN PHILADELPHIA WASN'T AVAILABLE FOR COMMENT
47jc0204 MR. SHLENKER COULDN'T BE REACHED
47jc0205 BECAUSE OF THAT SOME WALL STREET PROFESSIONALS THINK THE STOCK LOOKS RATHER EXPENSIVE
47jc0206 IT HAS TRIPLED SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE LARGELY ON TAKEOVER SPECULATION
47jc0207 IT CURRENTLY TRADES AT ABOUT NINE TIMES CASH FLOW SAYS ALAN GAINES OF GAINES BERLAND AN INSTITUTIONAL BROKERAGE FIRM
47jc0208 THAT'S ABOUT A THIRTY PERCENT PREMIUM TO QUALITY OIL COMPANIES LIKE ROYAL DUTCH PETROLEUM EXXON AND MOBIL HE SAYS
47jc0209 TO THESE ENDS K. P. C. ENJOYS A HUGE ECONOMIC ADVANTAGE
47jc020a IT COSTS KUWAIT ABOUT A DOLLAR TO PUMP A BARREL OF OIL AND ANOTHER FIFTY CENTS TO BRING IT TO EUROPE
47jc020b THE PRODUCTION COST OF NORTH SEA OIL BY CONTRAST RUNS BETWEEN EIGHT DOLLARS AND THIRTEEN DOLLARS A BARREL
47jc020c THE BIG DIFFERENCE DISTURBS EUROPEAN OIL MEN
47jc020d <NOISE> THE QUESTION WAS WHAT FORM THIS CONFLICT WOULD TAKE
47jc020e THE CIVIL WAR WAS FINALLY FOUGHT OVER MAINTAINING THE UNION
47jc020f BUT WHAT IF THERE HAD BEEN NO UNION
47jc020g WHAT IF THE SOUTH HAD BEEN A SEPARATE NATION
47jc020h WOULD SOUTHERNERS BLACK OR WHITE HAVE EVER ACHIEVED FULL EQUALITY IF THEY HAD BEEN INCORPORATED INTO THE UNION AS A CONQUERED PROVINCE
47jc020i OR WHAT IF THE WAR HAD BEEN AVOIDED AND SLAVERY JUST DRIFTED ON AND ON
47jc020j <NOISE> WOULD THE SOUTH HAVE BECOME ANOTHER SOUTH AFRICA
47jc020k I WOULDN'T BET AGAINST IT
47jc020l IT STILL ISN'T CLEAR WHAT FORM THE INCREASES WILL TAKE OR WHEN THEY WILL GO INTO EFFECT
47jc020m <NOISE> SOME CARRIERS SAID THEY PLAN TO RAISE FARES SUNDAY AND OTHERS SAID THEY WILL ACT A WEEK LATER
47jc020n <NOISE> SOME AIRLINES ALSO SAID THE INCREASES WON'T AFFECT THEIR LOWEST DISCOUNT FARES
47jc020o IN ADDITION LAURENTIAN SAID BERNHARD M. KOCH THIRTY THREE WAS NAMED VICE PRESIDENT AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER

47jc020q PREVIOUSLY MR. KOCH WAS DIRECTOR OF INTERNAL AUDIT AT LAURENTIAN GROUP CORPORATION AND IMPERIAL LIFE ASSURANCE COMPANY OF CANADA MAJORITY SHAREHOLDERS OF LAURENTIAN CAPITAL
47jc020r BUT THEY MAY NOT BE TRYING HARD ENOUGH OR AT LEAST NOT IN THE RIGHT WAYS
47jc020s THEY NEED ONLY LISTEN TO THE GROUP OF EIGHT WOMEN GATHERED HERE FOR A DISCUSSION OF WHAT THEY LIKE AND WHAT THEY DON'T ABOUT THE LATEST TRENDS IN FASHION RETAILING
47jc020t MANUFACTURERS WOULD SWIFTLY LEARN THAT THEIR CLOTHES OFTEN AREN'T RIGHT FOR WOMEN WHO WORK WHILE RETAILERS WOULD FIND THAT THEY HAVEN'T SUFFICIENTLY TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT THEIR CUSTOMERS' BUSY LIVES
47jc020u <NOISE> NEW YORK CITY'S BOARD OF EDUCATION WOULD DISAGREE

47jc0215 PRICES GRADUALLY MOVED HIGHER THROUGH MIDAFTERNOON WHEN THE MARKET PEAKED AND THEN STARTED ITS RETREAT
47jc0216 PHILIP PUCCIO MANAGER OF INSTITUTIONAL TRADING AT DILLON READ AND COMPANY SAID SOME INSTITUTIONS USED THE ADVANCE AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO SOME SELLING
47jc0217 <NOISE> THEY'VE BEEN PEELING OFF SOME STOCK TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF BETTER PRICES HE SAID
47jc0218 DURING THE SPRING AND SUMMER THE FED NUDGED UP SHORT TERM INTEREST RATES TO RESTRAIN THE ECONOMY
47jc0219 BUT WORRIED AS ALWAYS ABOUT BECOMING A POLITICAL FOOTBALL THE FED TRIED TO KEEP A LOW PROFILE IN THE WEEKS BEFORE THE ELECTION
47jc021a THAT STRATEGY WAS HELPED BY AN APPARENT SLOWDOWN IN ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE THIRD QUARTER WHICH EASED INFLATION WORRIES AND ALLOWED THE FED TO STOP PUSHING UP RATES
47jc021b <NOISE> IN THE YEAR EARLIER QUARTER THE LA JOLLA CALIFORNIA INDUSTRIAL AND INVESTMENT CONCERN HAD A RESTATED LOSS OF FIFTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS
47jc021c THE RESULTS WERE RESTATED TO REFLECT DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND THE CONSOLIDATION OF ITS SIGNAL LANDMARK HOLDINGS INC. UNIT A REAL ESTATE DEVELOPER <NOISE>

47jc0305 SALOMON'S STOCK DIVED ELEVEN PERCENT ON HUGE VOLUME MONDAY CASTING A TEMPORARY PALL OVER THE WHOLE GROUP
47jc0306 IT CLOSED YESTERDAY AT THIRTY NINE AND SEVEN EIGHTHS UP ONE EIGHTH
47jc0307 <NOISE> SOME HAVE CHARACTERIZED OUR COUNTERMEASURES AS PROTECTIONIST BROUGHT ABOUT BECAUSE OF CONGRESSIONAL PRESSURES
47jc0308 THAT IS DEAD WRONG
47jc0309 WE HAVE BEEN IN CONSULTATIONS WITH JAPAN ON THIS ISSUE SINCE NOVEMBER LONG BEFORE PRESENT TRADE LEGISLATION WAS INTRODUCED
47jc030a THE PRESIDENT'S ACTION WAS THE CULMINATION OF THAT PROCESS AND IT HAD NOTHING WHATSOEVER TO DO WITH TRADE BILLS
47jc030b PRESIDENT REAGAN BELIEVES THAT PEOPLE AND NATIONS SHOULD HONOR THEIR OBLIGATIONS
47jc030c THERE IS NOTHING PROTECTIONIST ABOUT THAT
47jc030d SUCH COST CUTTING EFFORTS HAVE WORSENED LABOR DISPUTES WHICH HAVE IN TURN PITTED NON UNION PILOTS AGAINST PRO UNION PILOTS
47jc030e FIRST OFFICER GUY CASEY WAS ONCE A CAPTAIN AT CONTINENTAL BUT LOST HIS SENIORITY DURING THE BITTER STRIKE THERE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE WHICH HE HAD HELPED TO ORGANIZE
47jc030f HE SAYS HE WANTS TO PUT THE EXPERIENCE BEHIND HIM
47jc030g ANALYSTS ALSO SAID THEY HADN'T EXPECTED LOWER OPERATING PROFITS FOR THE COMPANY'S INDUSTRIES GROUP AND FOR THE BROADCASTING SEGMENT
47jc030h WESTINGHOUSE OFFICIALS TOLD ANALYSTS THAT OPERATING PROFIT IN THE INDUSTRIES GROUP FELL FIFTEEN PERCENT TO TWENTY PERCENT HURT IN PART BY WEAK RESULTS IN CANADIAN OPERATIONS
47jc030i A SHARP DROP IN OPERATING PROFIT FROM THE BROADCASTING GROUP'S PRODUCTION COMPANY CONTRIBUTED TO THE SLIGHTLY LOWER OPERATING EARNINGS OVERALL FOR THAT SEGMENT
47jc030j THE SPOKESMAN ALSO SAID THE LEAGUE'S OWNERS ARE COMMITTED TO PLAYING WITH THEIR CURRENT REPLACEMENT ROSTERS FOR THE REST OF THE SEASON INCLUDING THE SUPER BOWL IF NECESSARY
47jc030k THAT MAY BE THE CASE IF MR. UPSHAW CAN BE TAKEN AT HIS WORD
47jc030l HE HAS SAID THAT THE PLAYERS WILL REMAIN ON STRIKE FOR THE DURATION IF THE UNION'S OFFER WAS REJECTED
47jc030m THE SOVIETS OBVIOUSLY WANT TO MAKE IT AS DIFFICULT AS POSSIBLE FOR NATO TO CARRY OUT ITS MODERNIZATION SAID ONE WESTERN DIPLOMAT IN BONN
47jc030n A SENIOR NATO DIPLOMAT ACCUSED THE SOVIETS OF TRYING TO SEDUCE THE GERMANS AWAY FROM US
47jc030o IT IS NONE TOO SUBTLE WEDGE DRIVING HE TOLD REUTERS
47jc030p WE NEVER HAD ONE BEFORE MR. TIMBERS SAID
47jc030q A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF OUR CLIENTS WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THAT OPTION
47jc030r <NOISE> IT'S NOT NECESSARILY A M:ARKET CALL
47jc030s MR. TIMBERS SAYS HE'S FAIRLY AMBIVALENT ABOUT THE PRICE OF GOLD NEAR TERM
47jc030t HE DOES SEE HOWEVER HIGHER INFLATION OF FIVE PERCENT OR SO IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE UP FROM FOUR PERCENT THIS YEAR
47jc030u <NOISE> A GOLD OPTION COULD BE A NICE ALTERNATIVE FOR FIXED INCOME INVESTORS SHOULD INFLATION FEARS ARISE MR. TIMBERS SAYS
47jc030v <NOISE> SOME ECONOMISTS SAY INFLATIONARY PRESSURES COULD CONTINUE TO PUSH UP U. S. INTEREST RATES THIS YEAR
47jc030w IF SO FOREIGN CENTRAL BANKS MAY SEE THAT AS AN *OPPORTUNITY* TO TIGHTEN AND TO ADDRESS THEIR OWN INFLATION WORRIES DESPITE U. S. CONCERNS
47jc030x ONE FEAR SAYS IRVING TRUST ECONOMIST ROBERT MCGEE IS THAT HIGHER GLOBAL RATES WILL SEND THE FINANCIAL MARKETS INTO A TAILSPIN
47jc030y A SIMILAR VIEW IS HELD BY GRETA E. MARSHALL INVESTMENT MANAGER OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC EMPLOYEES' RETIREMENT SYSTEM WHICH MANAGES ABOUT FORTY FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS
47jc030z I STILL SEE NO EVIDENCE THAT INFLATION IS PICKING UP SUBSTANTIALLY SHE SAYS
47jc0310 <NOISE> THE ECONOMY DOESN'T LOOK SO STRONG THAT IT WILL REKINDLE INFLATION SO I WOULD VIEW ANY FURTHER DROP IN BOND PRICES AS A BUYING OPPORTUNITY
47jc0311 <NOISE> ALAS THEY PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE DEVOTED A LITTLE MORE THOUGHT TO WINNEBAGO'S PAST

47jc0318 <NOISE> AFTER NEARLY EIGHT YEARS OF THE REAGAN PRESIDENCY A KIND OF MORNING AFTER MOOD PREVAILS HERE
47jc0319 <NOISE> THERE IS A SENSE THAT MR. REAGAN'S SUCCESSOR HASN'T ANY CHOICE BUT TO BE A CONSOLIDATION PRESIDENT
47jc031a GIVEN BUDGET CONSTRAINTS AND A RE ENERGIZED CONGRESS SOME HERE BELIEVE A BUSH ADMINISTRATION MAY NOT BE ALL THAT DIFFERENT FROM A DUKAKIS ADMINISTRATION
47jc031b SOME OF THAT CASH HAS BEEN USED FOR BONUS PAYMENTS
47jc031c WAGES AND BONUSES ROSE NINETEEN PERCENT IN THE FIRST HALF A RATE THAT FAR OUTPACED ECONOMIC GROWTH AND EXERTED UPWARD PRESSURE ON PRICES
47jc031d CHINA'S ECONOMY GREW AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF FIVE POINT SEVEN PERCENT IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS ROUGHLY HALF THE AVERAGE ANNUAL RATE IN THE PAST DECADE

47jc0404 THE BANKS SOUGHT TO ELIMINATE A MISMATCH BETWEEN THEIR ASSETS PREDOMINANTLY HELD IN NON POUND CURRENCIES AND THEIR CAPITAL KEPT IN POUNDS
47jc0405 WHEN THE POUND WAS WEAK DURING THE EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTIES THE VALUE OF SCANDINAVIAN BANK'S CAPITAL FELL STEEPLY IN PROPORTION TO ITS NON DOLLAR ASSETS
47jc0406 THE BANKS THAT OWNED SCANDINAVIAN BANK HAD TO INJECT ABOUT FORTY SEVEN POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS OF ADDITIONAL CAPITAL
47jc0407 ALSO THE STRONG RISE IN SHARE PRICES IN RECENT WEEKS APPEARS TO HAVE DISCONTINUED MOST OF THE GOOD NEWS LIKELY IN THE BUDGET ANOTHER DEALER SAID
47jc0408 IT'S GOING TO TAKE QUITE A LOT TO MOVE IT SHARPLY AHEAD FROM THIS LEVEL HE SAID
47jc0409 THE HUNDRED SHARE INDEX IS UP EIGHTEEN POINT SIX PERCENT THIS YEAR
47jc040a THE BOOK HE SAYS WILL BE ABOUT ARVIDA AND GENERALLY ABOUT COMPANIES SNARED IN THE TAKEOVER GAME
47jc040b IT WILL ASK SOME POINTED QUESTIONS IS THERE VALUE ADDED IN CORPORATE MERGERS
47jc040c DOES PRODUCTIVITY INCREASE AND WHAT HAPPENS TO THE PEOPLE INVOLVED
47jc040d THE PREMIER SAID IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR MR. GHAFAR TO REMAIN AS HIS DEPUTY

47jc040g <NOISE> DOCTOR MAHATHIR SAID
47jc040h <NOISE> S. D. I. PERPETUATES THE ILLUSION THAT MORE WEAPONS EQUALS MORE SECURITY
47jc040i OUR DEPENDENCE UPON VIOLENCE TO RESOLVE CONFLICT IS A SHORT TERN SOLUTION TO A LONG TERM PROBLEM
47jc040j IN ORDER TO ENSURE OUR SURVIVAL WE MUST CHANGE THE WAY WE THINK ABOUT CONFLICT
47jc040k BY SPENDING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON DEVELOPING NONVIOLENT MEANS OF RESOLVING CONFLICT WE CAN BUILD A WORLD BEYOND WAR AND A SUSTAINABLE SECURE FUTURE FOR ALL PEOPLE

47lc030r FARMERS OF COURSE WILL GET HIGHER PRICES FOR THEIR GRAIN FROM THE MARKET WHICH IN TURN SHOULD INDUCE THEM TO INCREASE PRODUCTION
47lc030s GRAIN PRODUCTION THROUGHOUT CHINA HAS FALTERED IN RECENT YEARS IN PART BECAUSE STATE PROCUREMENT PRICES WERE TOO LOW
47lc030t MEANWHILE SHARE PRICES CLOSED HIGHER IN SYDNEY HONG KONG WELLINGTON SEOUL AND MANILA AND WERE LOWER IN SINGAPORE

47lc030x THE LATEST WEATHER FORECAST CALLS FOR FAIRLY GOOD MOISTURE IN MIDWEST FARMING STATES OVER THE NEXT SIX TO TEN DAYS
47lc030y ANALYSTS SAID TRADERS ARE SHIFTING THEIR EMPHASIS AWAY FROM LAST YEAR'S CROP AND TO THIS YEAR'S
47lc030z WITH THIS YEAR'S SMALL ACREAGE INCREASES WEATHER AND SPRING PLANTING CONDITIONS ARE MAJOR CONCERNS TO A MARKET THAT IS BEGINNING TO SHAKE OFF A HUGE SURPLUS
47lc0310 THE FAVORABLE CONDITIONS HELPED THE SOYBEAN CONTRACT FOR NOVEMBER SETTLEMENT CLOSE AT SIX POINT EIGHT TWO TWO FIVE DOLLARS A BUSHEL DOWN NINE AND A HALF CENTS
47lc0311 ANOTHER EXECUTIVE EXPLAINS THE PROBLEMS AS THE OPPOSITE OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
47lc0312 LAST YEAR YOU HAD TUMULTUOUS SWINGS IN THE MARKETS THEMSELVES HE SAYS
47lc0313 THIS YEAR THE ENVIRONMENT WILL BE NARROWER SWINGS BUT VOLUME WILL BE LOWER WITH REVENUES INSUFFICIENT TO COVER COSTS
47lc0314 MORE IMPORTANT THAN ARITHMETIC HOWEVER IS MR. JACKSON'S MESSAGE
47lc0315 SPEAKING TO BLACK ASPIRATIONS HE REPRESENTS THE BEST OF THE AMERICAN DREAM
47lc0316 HE MIGHT EVEN QUALIFY AS A SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE IF NOT FOR HIS ENDORSEMENT OF HOMOSEXUAL RIGHTS
47lc0317 ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE GENERAL STRIKE FACTORIES CLOSED BUT BOOKSTORES REMAINED OPEN IN THIS OLD WORLD CULTURAL CENTER
47lc0318 MOST SCHOOLS WERE SHUT BUT PUSHKIN STREET NEAR THE SQUARE REVERBERATED AS USUAL WITH THE SOUND OF BADLY PLAYED CHOPIN EMANATING FROM THE OPEN WINDOWS OF THE MUSIC ACADEMY
47lc0319 MANY OF THE ARMENIAN DEMANDS ARE CULTURAL
47lc031a THEY WANT THEIR OLD FLAG REINSTATED THEIR CHILDREN SENT TO ARMENIAN SCHOOLS RATHER THAN RUSSIAN ONES THEIR OWN LANGUAGE USED ON OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS
47lc031b THEIR POLITICAL DEMANDS INCLUDE CALLS FOR A SEPARATE ARMY BRIGADE AND THE RIGHT FOR ARMENIA TO HAVE CONSULATES ABROAD
47lc031c THE STUDY WAS PART OF CORNELL'S RESPONSE TO CALLS BY LOCAL POLITICIANS THAT IT SHOULD HELP MORE IN TOMPKINS COUNTY
47lc031d WHEN THE SCHOOLS WERE RANKED BY OPERATING BUDGET OR VALUE OF BUILDINGS CORNELL'S ONE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLAR PAYMENTS WERE FOUND TO BE NEAR THE BOTTOM OF THE LIST

47lc0408 <NOISE> THIS IS SERIOUS STUFF HERE SAYS TOM SCHEERER TWENTY FOUR ADMIRING ONE CONTESTANT
47lc0409 SHE'S GOT TATTOOS AND EVERYTHING
47lc040a STILL SECURITIES AND BANKING REGULATORS WORRY WHETHER THEY ARE ACTING FAST ENOUGH TO SAFEGUARD AGAINST GROWING RISKS IN THE WORLD'S FINANCIAL MARKETS
47lc040b MANY AGREE THERE IS LITTLE TIME TO WASTE IN THE SCRAMBLE TO CREATE BETTER INTERNATIONAL REGULATION
47lc040c AS MR. FELDSTEIN SAYS YOU CAN'T JUST LOOK AT THE BUILDING AND SAY IT HASN'T FALLEN DOWN YET SO WE SHOULD BE SAFE
47lc040d WITH THE INITIAL FINANCING COMPLETE L. S. I. LOOKED ABROAD IN FEBRUARY NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO FOR ITS NEXT INFUSION

47lc040f AT THE TIME EUROPEANS WERE CLAMORING TO INVEST IN U. S. HIGH TECHNOLOGY AND HAD FEW OPPORTUNITIES TO PARTICIPATE DIRECTLY IN GOOD DEALS HE SAYS
47lc040g IF WE LOOK AT THE RECORD THE DEBATE SHOULD BE RATHER SHORT
47lc040h THE WINNERS OBVIOUS
47lc040i THE ONLY TRAGEDY AND IT'S AN AMAZING ONE IS THAT MOST AMERICANS DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED AND HOW IT CAME ABOUT
47lc040j BUT INSIDE ROOM SEVEN THIRTEEN THE JAPANESE SEE THE SITUATION SOMEWHAT DIFFERENTLY
47lc040k THEY REASON LIKE THIS IF THE U. S. IMPOSES SANCTIONS THEY MOST LIKELY WILL BE AIMED AT JAPANESE CONSTRUCTION COMPANIES DOING BUSINESS IN THE U. S.
47lc040l BUT THAT WOULD HURT THOUSANDS OF AMERICAN WORKERS WHO ARE EMPLOYED EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY BY SUCH COMPANIES
47lc040m THE POLITICAL FALLOUT FOR THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION MIGHT BE TOO GREAT TO RISK THAT

47lc040r IF MADE PRACTICAL THEY COULD BRING SPECTACULAR CHANGES TO ALMOST ANY ELECTRICAL PRODUCT OR PROCESS
47lc040s THAT COULD MEAN VASTLY FASTER AND MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT PRODUCTS SUCH AS COMPUTERS CARS AND HOUSEHOLD APPLIANCES
47lc040t <NOISE> BUT UNTIL THE RECENT BREAKTHROUGH SUPERCONDUCTORS HAD TO BE CHILLED TO A HOPELESSLY LOW TEMPERATURE TO WORK SO EXCEPT FOR A FEW APPLICATIONS THERE REALLY WAS NO TECHNOLOGY
47lc040u MR. IACOCCA SAID THAT WHILE THE PRICING ACTIONS INCREASED SALES THEY ALSO SQUEEZED CHRYSLER'S PROFIT MARGINS
47lc040v BUT HE ADDED THAT THE NUMBER THREE U. S. AUTO MAKER MADE A CONSCIOUS DECISION TO SACRIFICE PROFIT FOR A HIGHER MARKET SHARE
47lc040w THAT MOVE IS BEHIND CHRYSLER'S RECENT DECISIONS TO INCREASE PRODUCTION WHICH IN TURN WILL BOOST PROFIT FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR
47lc040x CRITICS ARGUE THAT HE MAY BE OVERLY OPTIMISTIC THOUGH
47lc040y AND MR. DUKAKIS IS CERTAIN TO FACE MORE PRESSURE ON THE QUESTION FROM VICE PRESIDENT BUSH WHO SUPPORTS BOTH THE M. X. AND MIDGETMAN
47lc040z MOREOVER MOST OF THE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS BEING CONSIDERED AS POTENTIAL RUNNING MATES FOR GOVERNOR DUKAKIS HAVE BACKED ONE OR THE OTHER MISSILE PLANS

47nc020f MONEY MANAGERS MINDING BILLION DOLLAR PORTFOLIOS ON THE OTHER HAND OFTEN AVOID SMALLER STOCKS BECAUSE THEY CAN'T PURCHASE A SIGNIFICANT STAKE WITHOUT AFFECTING THE PRICE
47nc020g THE DOLLAR'S SLIPPAGE CAME DESPITE MORE COMMENTS FROM TREASURY SECRETARY JAMES BAKER AIMED AT SUPPORTING IT
47nc020h IN A TELEVISION INTERVIEW MR. BAKER SAID THE U. S. AND ITS TOP SIX ECONOMIC ALLIES ARE PREPARED TO ACT TO STABILIZE THE DOLLAR AROUND CURRENT LEVELS

47nc020p EDWARD KENNEDY A ROCKWELL SPOKESMAN SAID MANY OF THOSE WORKING ON THE SHUTTLE IN PALMDALE WILL BE THOSE CURRENTLY CONSTRUCTING B. ONE B. AIRCRAFT
47nc020q A DIGITAL SPOKESMAN SAID THE COURT ACTION DOESN'T CHANGE THE STATUS QUO
47nc020r THE PART OF THE RULING THAT WAS OVERTURNED HASN'T BEEN IN EFFECT SINCE LAST JANUARY <NOISE> WHEN EMULEX OBTAINED THE STAY HE SAID
47nc020s HE ADDED THAT THE PARAGRAPHS OF THE ORDER THAT WERE UPHELD CONTINUE TO PROHIBIT EMULEX FROM USING TRADE SECRETS THAT DIGITAL SAYS WERE STOLEN FROM IT
47nc020t MR. PRENDERGAST ALSO ADMIRES NOMURA'S PERSEVERANCE
47nc020u <NOISE> THEY'VE BEEN CALLING ON US FOR ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS AND DIDN'T GENERATE ANY BUSINESS FOR THE FIRST TEN HE SAYS
47nc020v THEIR PERSISTENCE AND THE WEALTH OF JAPAN AND THE FLOWS OF CAPITAL FROM JAPAN HAVE PAID OFF FOR THEM
47nc020w PEOPLE THOUGHT WE'D SIT BACK AND JUST ENJOY THE HOLIDAYS <NOISE> SAID EDWARD P. NICOSKI MARKET STRATEGIST AT PIPER JAFFRAY AND HOPWOOD INC. MINNEAPOLIS
47nc020x BUT WE'RE SEEING SOME STRONG BUYING HERE
47nc020y WE'RE SEEING A WHOLE BUNCH OF STOCKS BREAKING OUT OF THEIR TRADING RANGES
47nc020z <NOISE> THE SOVIETS OBVIOUSLY WANT TO MAKE IT AS DIFFICULT AS POSSIBLE FOR NATO TO CARRY OUT ITS MODERNIZATION SAID ONE WESTERN DIPLOMAT IN BONN
47nc0210 A SENIOR NATO DIPLOMAT ACCUSED THE SOVIETS OF TRYING TO SEDUCE THE GERMANS AWAY FROM US
47nc0211 IT IS NONE TOO SUBTLE WEDGE DRIVING HE TOLD REUTERS
47nc0212 BUT AT ANOTHER OPERATION IN RURAL NORTHERN *ILLINOIS* THERE ARE HARDLY ANY MINORITIES TO DRAW FROM
47nc0213 WE PICKED THAT LOCATION BECAUSE WE NEEDED THE RIVER ACCESS THERE TO BE SUCCESSFUL MR. THOMPSON SAYS
47nc0214 -I KNOW I HAVE A SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
47nc0215 BUT I ALSO HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO MY SHAREHOLDERS
47nc0216 CHAMPION SAID ABOUT TWO THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED WORKERS STRUCK ITS FIVE LUMBER AND PLYWOOD PLANTS IN THE REGION OVER THE WEEKEND
47nc0217 STAMFORD CONN. BASED CHAMPION HAS FOURTEEN SUCH PLANTS NATIONWIDE THE SPOKESMAN SAID

47nc021e THE JURY ALSO FOUND THAT CLAYTON UNDER MISSOURI COMMON LAW HAD BREACHED ITS FIDUCIARY DUTIES BECAUSE OF SELF DEALING
47nc021f THE APPEALS COURT UPHELD THE LOWER COURT IN OCTOBER NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT
47nc0301 THE STATUTE ALLOWS FOR A GREAT DEAL OF LATITUDE AGREES ARTHUR CHRISTY THE FIRST SPECIAL PROSECUTOR APPOINTED UNDER THE NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT LAW
47nc0302 IN PAST INVESTIGATION HE NOTES THE FOCUS HAS BEEN QUITE NARROW
47nc0303 BUT IN EACH CASE HE SUGGESTS IT'S UP TO THE COUNSEL HE CERTAINLY HAS THE POWERS
47nc0304 ALSO THE STRONG RISE IN SHARE PRICES IN RECENT WEEKS APPEARS TO HAVE DISCOUNTED MOST OF THE GOOD NEWS LIKELY IN THE BUDGET ANOTHER DEALER SAID
47nc0305 IT'S GOING TO TAKE QUITE A LOT TO MOVE IT SHARPLY AHEAD FROM THIS LEVEL HE SAID
47nc0306 THE HUNDRED SHARE INDEX IS UP EIGHTEEN POINT SIX PERCENT THIS YEAR
47nc0307 SOME TIRE EXECUTIVES SUCH AS JOHN J. NEVIN CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF FIRESTONE TIRE AND I- RUBBER COMPANY SAY MR. STONE UNDERSTANDS THE INDUSTRY'S PROBLEMS
47nc0308 BUT MR. STONE'S UNION CRITICS AREN'T SO GENEROUS
47nc0309 THEY SAY HE HAS BEEN LAX ABOUT ORGANIZING NEW MEMBERS FOR EXAMPLE
47nc030a UNDER THE AGREEMENT SUBJECT TO REGULATORY APPROVAL YPSILANTI SHAREHOLDERS WOULD RECEIVE ONE POINT NINE THREE FIVE SHARES OF TRUSTCORP COMMON FOR EACH COMMON SHARE OF YPSILANTI
47nc030b TRUSTCORP SAID IT PLANS TO COMPLETE THE PURCHASE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER
47nc030c YPSILANTI SAVINGS BANK HAS ABOUT ONE THIRTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN ASSETS
47nc030d TRUSTCORP INCOME IS A HOLDING COMPANY WITH ASSETS OF F- FOUR POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS
47nc030e CRITICS OF INDEXING CHARGE THAT THE APPROACH LACKS IMAGINATION AND AMOUNTS TO SETTLING FOR MEDIOCRITY
47nc030f ADVOCATES REPLY THAT INDEXING MEANS LOWER MANAGEMENT FEES THAN THOSE OF ACTIVELY MANAGED BOND FUNDS
47nc030g <NOISE> ALSO INDEXING IN RECENT YEARS OFTEN HAS PRODUCED SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER RESULTS <NOISE> THAN MANY ACTIVE MANAGERS
47nc030h BUT JOHN SMALE P. AND G'S CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE USED THE MEETING TO SPEAK AT LENGTH ABOUT HOSTILE TAKEOVERS IN GENERAL
47nc030i HE MAINTAINED THAT TOO OFTEN THEY LEAVE COMPANIES LOADED WITH DEBT AND SHRUNKEN RESEARCH BUDGETS AND IGNORE THE INTERESTS OF EMPLOYEES AND THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH THE COMPANIES DO BUSINESS
47nc030j <NOISE> HE ALSO ARGUED THAT OVER THE LONG RUN HOSTILE TAKEOVERS DON'T NECESSARILY PROVIDE A GOOD MECHANISM FOR SHAREHOLDERS TO REALIZE FULL VALUE FOR THEIR SHARES
47nc030k A FRENCH PRESS REPORT SAID THE EXPORTS INCLUDE SOPHISTICATED EQUIPMENT FOR MAKING SEMICONDUCTORS
47nc030l IT SAID THE MACHINERY MAY HAVE HELPED THE SOVIETS BUILD ADVANCED COMPUTER MEMORIES FOR SUCH MILITARY PURPOSES AS MISSILE GUIDANCE
47nc030m WESTERN NATIONS HAVE REACHED AGREEMENTS INTENDED TO FORBID EXPORTS OF SUCH EQUIPMENT TO THE SOVIETS
47nc030n WHEN STOCKS ARE RISING PORTFOLIO INSURERS DON'T HEDGE AND INSTEAD RIDE THE MARKET HIGHER
47nc030o WHEN STOCKS ARE FALLING PORTFOLIO INSURERS SELL STOCK INDEX FUTURES IN EFFECT CUSHIONING THE VALUES OF THEIR STOCK PORTFOLIOS FROM THE FULL BRUNT OF A DROPPING MARKET
47nc030p THE IDEA ACCORDING TO WALL STREET PROPONENTS IS TO PROVIDE PROTECTION AT A LOW COST
47nc030q AS A MANAGER MR. O'MALLEY CONCEDES HE PUSHES SUBORDINATES TO WORK LONG AND HARD HOURS IF NECESSARY
47nc030r BUT AS A BOSS I PICK MY SPOTS TO BE TOUGH HE ADDS
47nc030s I ALSO LIKE TO LET PROFESSIONALS SHOW HOW GOOD THEY CAN BE ON THEIR OWN
47nc030t DECEMBER DELIVERY GOLD SETTLED AT FOUR EIGHTY TWO POINT SEVEN ZERO DOLLARS FOR A DECLINE OF TWELVE POINT EIGHT ZERO DOLLARS
47nc030u DECEMBER SILVER FELL THIRTY THREE POINT THREE CENTS TO SIX POINT SIX FOUR FIVE DOLLARS

47nc030w YESTERDAY PEOPLE CLOSE TO FEDERATED'S BOARD SAID THAT THE COMPANY WAS STILL OPEN TO YET ANOTHER FRIENDLY MERGER PROPOSAL FROM CAMPEAU
47nc030x IF THEY'VE GOT SOMETHING TO SHOW US WE'LL TAKE A LOOK AT IT
47nc030y THEY KNOW WHERE TO FIND US SAID ONE SOURCE
47nc030z WE'RE NOT STONEWALLING THEM
47nc0310 CAR SALES APPARENTLY HAVE LEVELED OFF AFTER DISAPPOINTING RESULTS EARLY IN THE YEAR FOLLOWED BY A SHARP UPTICK IN LATE JANUARY
47nc0311 BIGGER INCENTIVES FUELED THE REBOUND AND HAVE HELPED SUSTAIN THE SALES PACE
47nc0312 CHRYSLER CORPORATION FOR EXAMPLE BOOSTED CASH REBATES TO TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS ON SOME MODELS
47nc0313 <NOISE> GIVEN THE NATURE OF OUR OWNERSHIP IT'S OBVIOUSLY A VERY COMPLEX ISSUE MR. ELISH SAID
47nc0314 THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS TO CONSIDER AND WE'RE LOOKING AT IT
47nc0315 BUT NOTHING IS IMMINENT
47nc0316 IT DOES NOT HOWEVER SEEM REASONABLE TO THE GERMANS WHO ARE INSTEAD MULLING A TAX INCREASE TO SHORE UP A LEAKY GOVERNMENT BUDGET
47nc0317 AS FOR THE U. S. COMMENTS ON GERMAN INFLATION A TYPICAL GERMAN MIGHT RESPOND ZERO INFLATION
47nc0318 WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT
47nc0319 GENERALLY THERE'S NO LIMIT ON HOW MUCH OF THEIR FUNDS EMPLOYEES CAN BORROW IF THEIR ACCOUNTS TOTAL TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS OR LESS
47nc031a FOR LARGER ACCOUNTS EMPLOYEES ARE RESTRICTED TO BORROWING HALF THE TOTAL BUT NO MORE THAN FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS
47nc031b LOANS MUST BE REPAID WITHIN FIVE YEARS UNLESS THE MONEY GOES TOWARD BUYING A PRINCIPAL RESIDENCE IN WHICH CASE LONGER REPAYMENT TERMS CAN BE ARRANGED
47nc031c BORROWED FUNDS AREN'T TAXED
47nc031d BUT A WITHDRAWAL IS TREATED AS TAXABLE INCOME AND IS SUBJECT TO AN ADDITIONAL TEN PERCENT PENALTY TAX
47nc0401 LIKE DREXEL MR. ICAHN HAS BEEN SUBPOENAED IN CONNECTION WITH THE GOVERNMENT'S CONTINUING INVESTIGATION OF THE BOESKY SCANDAL
47nc0402 A *SUBPOENA* IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION AND DOESN'T IMPLY ANY WRONGDOING
47nc0403 MR. ICAHN'S LAWYERS AT WEIL GOTSCHAL AND MANGES IN NEW YORK SAID THE INVESTIGATION HAD ABSOLUTELY NO CONNECTION WITH THE WITHDRAWAL OF MR. ICAHN'S BID
47nc0404 BUT MR. GIBBS IS HOPEFUL THAT MANY TAXPAYERS WILL ACCEPT
47nc0405 AMONG OTHER INCENTIVES THE NEW TAX LAW PHASES OUT THE DEDUCTIBILITY OF INTEREST PAYMENTS TO THE I. R. S.
47nc0406 <NOISE> THE I. R. S. HA- ALSO HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN TAX COURT CHALLENGES TO PEOPLE INVOLVED IN TAX SHELTERS
47nc0407 WE'RE WINNING MORE THAN WE'RE LOSING THE I. R. S. CHIEF POINTS OUT
47nc0408 DOUBLEDAY ALSO PROVIDED BERTELSMANN WITH MUCH NEEDED U. S. BOOK MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS <NOISE>
47nc0409 MOREOVER MR. VITALE SAYS IT'S WORTH A PREMIUM TO GET A FOOTHOLD IN THE U. S. MARKET
47nc040a IF YOU ARE IN PUBLISHING THE ONLY MARKET WITH LARGE NUMBERS IS THE ENGLISH SPEAKING MARKET HE SAYS
47nc040b MANY PEOPLE HOWEVER CLAIM THAT IRRESPONSIBLE OWNERS NOT THE DOGS THEMSELVES ARE TO BLAME FOR THE HIGH INCIDENCE OF ATTACKS
47nc040c THEY'RE AMORAL SAYS AN OFFICIAL OF THE UNITED KENNEL CLUB A PRESTIGIOUS PEDIGREE ASSOCIATION
47nc040d THEY'LL DO WHAT THE TRAINER ALLOWS THEM TO DO
47nc040e K. MART AND BRUNO'S SAID THEIR HYPERMARKETS WHICH HAVEN'T BEEN NAMED YET WILL INCLUDE SPECIALTY SHOPS
47nc040f THE FACILITIES WILL COVER ABOUT TWO TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND SQUARE FEET OR THREE TIMES THE SPACE OF THE AVERAGE K. MART DISCOUNT DEPARTMENT STORE
47nc040g <NOISE> LOCATED IN MAJOR METROPOLITAN AREAS THEY WILL BE TOTALLY DISTINCT FROM THE CURRENT OPERATIONS OF BOTH COMPANIES A PREPARED STATEMENT SAID
47nc040h THE FIRST IS EXPECTED TO OPEN NEXT YEAR
47nc040i WHAT'S MORE A FURTHER DROP IN THE DOLLAR COULD HAVE THE VERY RESULT MR. BAKER SEEKS TO AVOID HIGHER INTEREST RATES
47nc040j IN ORDER TO KEEP PERSUADING FOREIGN INVESTORS TO HOLD CHEAPER DOLLARS THE FEDERAL RESERVE MUST KEEP U. S. INTEREST RATES HIGHER THAN THOSE ABROAD
47nc040k AN EVEN WEAKER DOLLAR COULD REQUIRE HIGHER RATES
47nc040l UNDER TERMS OF THE ORIGINAL AGREEMENT COMPUTER MEMORIES WOULD HAVE ISSUED NEW SHARES OF ITS OWN IN EXCHANGE FOR SHARES OF CLOSELY HELD HEMDALE
47nc040m CURRENT HEMDALE HOLDERS THEN WOULD HAVE OWNED ABOUT SEVENTY EIGHT PERCENT OF COMPUTER MEMORIES' SHARES
47nc040n THE SURVIVING COMPANY WOULD HAVE BEEN NAMED HEMDALE FILM CORPORATION AND JOHN DALY HEMDALE'S CURRENT CHAIRMAN WOULD HAVE BECOME CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE SURVIVING COMPANY
47nc040o A SPOKESMAN F:OR CRAY DESCRIBED THE M. I. T. DECISION AS GOOD NEWS
47nc040p ASSUMING THE BIDDING DOES OPEN UP AGAIN IT MEANS THERE'S ROOM FOR TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND NOT CONSIDERATIONS BASED PURELY ON PRICE
47nc040q THE SPOKESMAN SAID IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE FOR CRAY TO INSTALL AND OPERATE A COMPLETE SUPERCOMPUTER SYSTEM <NOISE> AT THE PRICES M. I. T. WANTED TO PAY
47nc040r WITH TECHNOLOGY LIKE THIS THE COMPANY THAT INVENTED THE OVERNIGHT EXPRESS BUSINESS FOURTEEN YEARS AGO STILL DOMINATES IT
47nc040s FEDERAL EXPRESS COLLECTS MORE THAN HALF THE REVENUE IN WHAT IS NOW MORE THAN A SIX BILLION INDUSTRY
47nc040t AND AT A TIME WHEN DETERIORATING SERVICE IS A NATIONAL MALADY THIS COMPANY CLAIMS TO DELIVER MORE THAN NINETY NINE PERCENT OF ITS LETTERS AND PACKAGES ON TIME
47nc040u HOUSING STARTS TOTALED ONE <NOISE> SIX SEVENTY FOUR THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED UNITS LAST YEAR BY TWENTY TWO POINT SEVEN PERCENT FROM NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
47nc040v IN DECEMBER ALONE STARTS ROSE TWENTY POINT EIGHT PERCENT TO ONE FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND FIVE EIGHTY NINE UNITS
47nc040w THAT MARKED THE TWENTIETH CONSECUTIVE MONTHLY INCREASE
47nc040x EARLY FEBRUARY NORTH AMERICAN BUILT CAR SALES EDGED UP ZERO POINT THREE PERCENT ACCORDING TO FIGURES REPORTED LAST WEEK
47nc040y THAT TRANSLATES INTO A SEASONALLY ADJUSTED ANNUAL RATE OF EIGHT POINT ONE MILLION VEHICLES COMPARED WITH A SEVEN POINT SEVEN MILLION RATE A YEAR EARLIER
47nc040z THIS WEEK'S MID FEBRUARY REPORT ON CAR SALES WILL TELL WHETHER THAT PACE WAS BEING MAINTAINED
47nc0410 OF COURSE TO A GREAT EXTENT THE STOCK PRICES OF THE VARIOUS COMPANIES THAT WILL BE REPORTING HIGHER EARNINGS ALREADY <NOISE> REFLECT SHAREHOLDER EXPECTATIONS
47nc0411 THAT OBVIOUSLY WILL MUTE THE PRICE MOVEMENT OF ANY PARTICULAR STOCK WHEN THE COMPANY REPORTS ITS EARNINGS UNLESS ANALYSTS' ESTIMATES ARE SERIOUSLY OUT OF KILTER
47nc0412 AS PORTFOLIO STRATEGISTS PUZZLE OVER THE MARKET IMPACT OF THIS WAVE OF GOOD NEWS THEY COME UP WITH SOME SHARPLY DIVERGENT OPINIONS
47nc0413 AFTER LAR(RY)- LARRY SPEAKES LOST HIS JOB WITH MERRILL LYNCH I WAS A LITTLE RELUCTANT TO JOIN THE POSSE OF CRITICS
47nc0414 YOU HATE TO KICK A GUY WHEN HE'S DOWN

47nc0419 MONARCH HAS ABOUT SEVEN POINT TWO MILLION SHARES OUTSTANDING
47nc041a OVERALL CONSUMER SPENDING HAS SLOWED SINCE LAST YEAR'S STOCK MARKET CRASH BUT IT'S STILL AT A LEVEL THAT WORRIES SOME ECONOMISTS
47nc041b <NOISE> CONSUMER CREDIT SLOWED SHARPLY IN JULY REFLECTING SLUGGISH SALES
47nc041c TOO MUCH SPENDING AT HOME COUPLED WITH HEAVY DEMAND FOR EXPORTS COULD OVERLOAD AN INDUSTRIAL SECTOR THAT IS ALREADY RUNNING NEAR CAPACITY

47oc020k HIS LARGER FUNDS WHICH CAN INCLUDE U. S. STOCKS DIDN'T FARE AS WELL
47oc020l TURNOUT IS ANOTHER UNKNOWN FACTOR
47oc020m TO CAPITALIZE HERE GOVERNOR DUKAKIS WOULD LIKE TO SEE A HEAVY TURNOUT ESPECIALLY IN SUCH POCKETS OF STRENGTH AS THE CHICAGO LAKEFRONT AND SUBURBS

47oc0212 <NOISE> MR. CHATICHAI'S WEALTHY FAMILY BACKGROUND AND HIS FAMILY'S LARGE PROPERTY INTERESTS GIVE HIM A GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY
47oc0213 FURTHER HE HAS GOOD RELATIONS WITH THE LARGE ETHNIC CHINESE COMMUNITY AND SERVES AS A CHAIRMAN <NOISE> OF THE THAI CHINESE FRIENDSHIP ASSOCIATION
47oc0214 THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE COUNTRY'S BUSINESS ELITE MANY OF WHOM ARE ETHNIC CHINESE

47oc030i MR. WALSH'S LEGAL THEORY ABOUT THE FLOW OF FUNDS IS LIKELY TO BE THE LINCHPIN OF AN EFFORT TO BRING BROADER CONSPIRACY AND OTHER CRIMINAL CHARGES

47oc030k A FINAL DECISION ON SEEKING CHARGES COULD COME IN SEPTEMBER

47qc0215 <NOISE> IT'S MY SENSE THAT THERE WAS A TIME WHEN PEOPLE THOUGHT THEY COULD TRADE ON INSIDE INFORMATION WITH ABSOLUTE IMPUNITY
47qc0216 AND THAT'S NO LONGER TRUE
47qc0217 NOW I AM CERTAIN THAT THERE ARE STILL PEOPLE WHO THINK THEY CAN TRADE ON INSIDE INFORMATION AND GET AWAY WITH IT <NOISE> BECAUSE THEY'RE SMARTER THAN THE AVERAGE PERSON
47qc0218 THERE WILL ALWAYS BE THOSE PEOPLE
47qc0219 BUT I THINK THAT THE ACTIONS HAVE HAD A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON CONDUCT
47qc021a BACK WHEN OFFICIAL LINES STAYED PUT INTOURIST GUIDES HAD IT EASY
47qc021b WITH EPIC PROPAGANDA AND TORRENTS OF STATISTICS THEY GLIBLY PRAISED THE SOVIET UNION'S ETERNAL PROGRESS

47qc030b <NOISE> THE ONLY REQUIREMENT IS THAT YOU HAVE TO BE AN ADULT TO RECEIVE THE MAGAZINE SAYS MARY TAYLOR ASSOCIATE PUBLISHER
47qc030c THAT'S NOT BECAUSE OF RACY ARTICLES BUT BECAUSE THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF TRYING TO SNATCH TWELVE AND THIRTEEN YEAR OLDS
47qc030d <NOISE> PHILIP MORRIS IS EVEN CONSIDERING SELLING SPACE TO OUTSIDE ADVERTISERS IT ALREADY RAN AN AD FOR TIME MAGAZINE ON A TEST BASIS IN ITS WINTER NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN ISSUE

47qc0310 A MCCORMICK VICE PRESIDENT ATTRIBUTES WOMEN'S GAINS AT THE COMPANY TO A DEEP ROOTED WORK ETHIC AND A STRONG DESIRE FOR SUCCESS
47qc0311 THE TRADE BILL WOULD DIRECT PRESIDENTIAL ACTION AGAINST COUNTRIES THAT PERMIT PIRACY OF U. S. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
47qc0312 IT WOULD REQUIRE THE PRESIDENT TO IDENTIFY COUNTRIES THAT DON'T PROTECT COPYRIGHTS AND PATENTS AND TO INITIATE EXPEDITED UNFAIR TRADE INVESTIGATIONS IN THE MOST EGREGIOUS CASES
47qc0313 THE PRESIDENT COULD DECLINE TO MOVE AGAINST CERTAIN COUNTRIES IF DOING SO WOULD BE AGAINST THE NATIONAL ECONOMIC INTEREST THOUGH
47qc0314 CONGRESS WANTS SPEEDY ACTION BECAUSE TIME OFTEN CAN BE CRITICAL IN WINNING PROTECTION FOR CERTAIN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY <NOISE> SUCH AS COMPUTER SOFTWARE WHICH CAN BE COPIED RAPIDLY

47qc040e <NOISE> BULLION DEALERS SAY THE FIVE HOUSES FIXING THE GOLD PRICE HAVE TO RESPOND TO THE NEEDS OF THE MARKET AND REQUIREMENTS OF BRITISH FINANCIAL LEGISLATION
47qc040f AS A GROUP THE FIVE BULLION FIRMS TRANSACT LESS BUSINESS THAN OUTSIDE MARKET MAKERS SEVERAL LONDON BULLION TRADERS SAY

47qc040k THE OPPOSITION IS ALREADY ROLLING
47qc040l MANY OF THE PRESSURE GROUPS THAT CAMPAIGNED UNSUCCESSFULLY AGAINST MR. REAGAN IN TWO PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS SEEM TO REGARD THIS BATTLE AS THEIR ARMAGEDDON
47qc040m TEDDY KENNEDY HIMSELF HAS TESTIFIED THAT JUDGE BORK'S APPEARANCE MEANS THE END IS NEAR
47qc040n IF RONALD REAGAN WANTS ROBERT BORK CONFIRMED HE WILL HAVE TO CREATE AN ALTERNATIVE CHOICE TO THE ONE THESE GROUPS ARE TRYING TO FORCE ON UNDECIDED SENATORS
47qc040o THAT MEANS MR. REAGAN HAS TO EXPLAIN CLEARLY WHY AMERICAN SOCIETY WILL BENEFIT IF JUDGES SUCH AS ROBERT BORK APPLY THE LAW IN A NEUTRAL MANNER
47qc040p <NOISE> HE WILL HAVE TO POINT OUT WHY MANY OF THE LONG HELD GRIEVANCES OF THE ELECTORATE RESULT <NOISE> WHEN UNELECTED JUDGES MANUFACTURE NEW LAWS

47qc040r <NOISE> BUT HIS STORY ALSO SUGGESTS THAT SOME CHARACTER TRAITS THAT MAY GIVE RISE TO INSIDER TRADING <NOISE> CAN BE HARD TO CHANGE
47qc040s INSIDER TRADING IS A FORM OF FRAUD AND SOME SPORT ABOUT FRANCHISEES NOW CLAIM THEY HAVE BEEN DEFRAUDED BY MR. ANTONIU
47qc040t PET OWNERS OFTEN CALL A PET PSYCHIC BECAUSE A PET IS SICK AND THEY WANT A DETAILED ACCOUNT OF HOW IT'S FEELING
47qc040u AND SOME PET PSYCHICS CLAIM THEY CAN CHAT WITH PETS FROM A DISTANCE
47qc040v FOR EXAMPLE GAY TRAVERS A FORMER PUBLICIST CALLED PET PSYCHIC PENELOPE SMITH WHEN HER CAT SEBASTIAN WAS VERY ILL
47qc040w MS. SMITH TOLD HER TO HANG UP WHILE THE PSYCHIC TALKED TO SEBASTIAN
47qc040x THREE MINUTES LATER SHE CALLED BACK WITH SOME BAD NEWS

47qc040z <NOISE> IT'S A FASHIONABLE NUMBER SAID MR. CHANDROSS OF LLOYD'S BANK NEW YORK
47qc0410 ECONOMISTS ARE CURRENTLY FOCUSING ON THE INDEX TO GET A READING ON WAGE INFLATION
47qc0411 <NOISE> THE LABOR DEPARTMENT WILL CONTINUE TO REPORT MONTHLY AGGREGATE DATA ON AVERAGE HOURLY EARNINGS
47qc0412 BUT THE INDEX IS BEING REPLACED BY THE EMPLOYMENT COST SERIES
47qc0413 ECONOMISTS SAID THE NEW INDEX HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF BEING A MORE RELIABLE READING AND THE DISADVANTAGE OF COMING OUT ONLY ONCE A QUARTER RATHER THAN EVERY MONTH
47qc0414 NEWSPAPERS' COSTS ARE UP SHARPLY THIS YEAR LARGELY BECAUSE OF HIGHER NEWSPRINT PRICES THE INDUSTRY'S BIGGEST COST BEHIND LABOR EXPENSES
47qc0415 <NOISE> SINCE OCTOBER NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX PRICES HAVE RISEN THREE TIMES BY A TOTAL OF ABOUT TWENTY ONE PERCENT
47qc0416 NEWSPAPERS HAVE RESPONDED BY USING LIGHTER WEIGHT PAPER TRIMMING PAGE SIZE AND CUTTING THE SPACE FOR NEWS
47qc0417 <NOISE> MEANWHILE CIVIL RICO CONTINUES TO ATTRACT PLAINTIFFS WHO WANT TO TURN GENERAL BUSINESS DISPUTES <NOISE> THAT BELONG IN STATE COURTS INTO FEDERAL OFFENSES

47qc0419 <NOISE> THE SECOND LOWEST BIDDER RECENTLY FILED A CIVIL RICO ACTION <NOISE> CLAIMING THAT MISREPRESENTATIONS WERE MADE BY THE SUCCESSFUL BIDDERS USING THE TELEPHONE <NOISE> THEREBY COMMITTING FEDERAL WIRE FRAUD

47qc041d SOURCE FULTON PREBON U. S. A. INCORPORATED
47rc0201 ONE PROBLEM WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE UNPOPULAR NEW W. FOUR FORM IS THAT THE I. R. S. FAILED TO TEST IT ADEQUATELY
47rc0202 IN FACT THE FORM WASN'T SHOWN TO THE PUBLIC AT ALL
47rc0203 IT WAS PRESENTED ONLY TO I. R. S. EMPLOYEES IN TWO OF THE AGENCY'S SERVICE CENTERS
47rc0204 OFFICIALS SUGGEST THAT THESE CLERICAL NON TECHNICAL WORKERS REALLY AREN'T MUCH DIFFERENT FROM THE GENERAL PUBLIC
47rc0205 STILL MR. GIBBS CONCEDES THAT THE AGENCY PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE SOUGHT A WIDER VIEW
47rc0206 MR. JOYNES WILL OVERSEE THE COMPANY'S OPERATING UNITS AS WELL AS THE COMPANY'S RESEARCH ACTIVITIES AND STAFF SUPPORT SERVICES THE COMPANY SAID
47rc0207 THE SPOKESMAN WOULDN'T COMMENT AS TO WHETHER MR. JOYNES <NOISE> MIGHT SUCCEED MR. DAY AS CHAIRMAN
47rc0208 MR. DAY MUST RETIRE AT AGE SIXTY FIVE
47rc0209 UNDER THE FEDERAL RAILWAY LABOR ACT THE REJECTION TRIGGERED A THIRTY DAY COOLING OFF PERIOD THAT STARTED YESTERDAY
47rc020a IF AMERICAN AND ITS UNION CAN'T REACH A SETTLEMENT BY THEN THE AIRLINE CAN IMPOSE ITS LATEST CONTRACT OFFER OR LOCK OUT ITS FLIGHT ATTENDANTS
47rc020b THE ASSOCIATION OF PROFESSIONAL FLIGHT ATTENDANTS WOULD ALSO BE FREE TO STRIKE <NOISE> BUT IT HAS SAID IT DOESN'T PLAN TO DO SO
47rc020c THE LASTEST DISCLOSURES <NOISE> ARE AN OUTGROWTH OF THAT PROBE
47rc020d ALREADY THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION HAS ACCUSED DELTA AIRLINES AND EASTERN AIRLINES OF ENGAGING IN UNREALISTIC SCHEDULING AT ATLANTA'S HARTSFIELD AIRPORT
47rc020e THE CARRIERS DENY THIS BUT THE GOVERNMENT HAS EXPANDED ITS PROBE
47rc020f IT HAS ASKED SEVERAL OTHER AIRLINES TO TURN OVER THEIR ON TIME RECORDS AT DALLAS FORT WORTH CHICAGO'S O'HARE AND BOSTON'S LOGAN AIRPORTS
47rc020g ALONG WITH HIS PARTNER PHIL DILEO MR. KELLNER HAS BEEN REGARDED AS ONE OF WALL STREET'S BIGGEST AND BRIGHTEST MONEYMAKERS
47rc020h KELLNER DILEO STARTED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE WITH ONLY FIVE MILLION AND REPORTEDLY HAS HAD AVERAGE ANNUAL GAIN OF SIXTY PERCENT BEFORE PAYOUTS TO LIMITED PARTNERS

47rc020j A CONVENTION WOULD OPEN THE DOOR TO A WHOLE NEW GROUP OF LEADERS
47rc020k AN ELECTION TO CHOOSE CONVENTION DELEGATES <NOISE> WOULD BE LIKE A SPECIAL ELECTION TO PICK A NEW CONGRESS

47rc020o B. P.'S PARTIALLY PAID AMERICAN DEPOSITARY SHARES CLOSED UNCHANGED AT SEVENTEEN ONE QUARTER WITH THIRTEEN POINT TWO MILLION TRADED
47rc020p IT WAS THE BIG BOARD'S MOST ACTIVE ISSUE
47rc020q IN A STATEMENT NYMEX EFFECTIVELY TOLD COMEX TO BACK OFF
47rc020r AND IT IS SUGGESTED THAT COMEX IS TO BLAME FOR THE DELAY SPECIFICALLY THE FACT THAT MR. BRODY NEXT MONTH WILL RELINQUISH HIS CHAIRMANSHIP TO AN EXCHANGE MEMBER

47rc020x IN LATE APRIL ENRON AN INTEGRATED NATURAL GAS CONCERN PUT OIL AND GAS ASSETS UP FOR SALE
47rc020y ANALYSTS VALUED THOSE PROPERTIES AT TWO BILLION AND ONE SAID ENRON HAS RECEIVED ABOUT TWENTY OFFERS
47rc020z ENRON WOULDN'T CONFIRM THE NUMBER OF OFFERS
47rc0210 MANY PEOPLE CRITICIZE ADS THAT GLORIFY JUNK
47rc0211 SOME SINGLED OUT AS A CONTRADICTORY A COOKING OIL AD TELLING PEOPLE HOW TO CUT DOWN ON CHOLESTEROL BUT FEATURING FRIED CHICKEN AND FRENCH FRIES
47rc0212 IT'S ALSO DISHONEST SOME SAID TO OMIT INFORMATION OR HIDE IT IN SMALL PRINT

47rc0214 I JUST CHECKED THIS MORNING HE SAID
47rc0215 BIDS WERE DOWN A QUARTER TO A HALF A POINT AND I'M TOLD THEY'RE NOW STARTING TO COME BACK
47rc0216 IT'S BUSINESS AS USUAL
47rc0217 VOLUME IS NO DIFFERENT
47rc0218 THE MARKET HASN'T CHANGED CHARACTER
47rc0219 SO FAR FROM A MARKET VIEWPOINT IT DOESN'T LOOK TO BE MUCH OF AN EVENT
47rc021a EVER SINCE HE TOOK OFFICE THREE AND A HALF YEARS AGO MR. GORBACHEV HAS SOUGHT TO INCREASE FOREIGN TRADE'S MEAGER SHARE OF THE SOVIET ECONOMY
47rc021b RATHER THAN SIMPLY IMPORT MORE WESTERN GOODS HE WOULD LIKE TO OBTAIN THE MACHINERY AND KNOW HOW TO ENABLE THE SOVIETS TO MAKE THE GOODS THEMSELVES
47rc021c TO DO SO HE OPENED UP THE ECONOMY TO FOREIGN CAPITAL AND EQUIPMENT BY PERMITTING JOINT VENTURES
47rc021d HE RETURNED HOME IN TIME FOR HIS FIFTEENTH BIRTHDAY IN MARCH NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
47rc021e AS PART OF THE TREATMENT HE ATTENDED FIFTEEN WEEKS OF AFTER CARE FIVE DAYS A WEEK
47rc021f HE ALSO WAS REQUIRED TO GO TO NINETY MEETINGS OF ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS OR NARCOTICS ANONYMOUS IN NINETY DAYS
47rc021g HE DID SO WITH ENTHUSIASM HE DROPPED DRUG USING FRIENDS AND IT SEEMED OUR TROUBLES SOON WOULD BE BEHIND US
47rc0301 BRITAIN IS LAUNCHING A NATIONWIDE AIDS WARNING CAMPAIGN THAT URGES THE USE OF CONDOMS FOR PEOPLE WHO WON'T RESTRICT THEIR *SEXUAL* PARTNERS
47rc0302 LEAFLETS THAT ARE BEING DELIVERED TO TWENTY THREE MILLION HOUSEHOLDS WARN THAT AIDS ISN'T LIMITED TO HOMOSEXUALS
47rc0303 OFFICIALS SAY TELEVISION WARNINGS WILL FOLLOW
47rc0304 THE ISSUE IS SO SENSITIVE HERE SAYS BOND ANALYST DANIEL SCOTTO OF L. F. ROTHSCHILD UNTERBERG AND TOWBIN
47rc0305 WE ARE ALL CONCERNED THAT THE REGULATORS CAN SIT BACK AND WAIT FOR CREDIT TO CARRY OUT THE COMPANY OUT INTO THE HORIZON
47rc0306 BUT HE ADDED THE BANKERS ARE WAITING FOR COMMITMENTS FROM THE REGULATORS AND THE REGULATORS ARE WAITING FOR COMMITMENTS FROM THE BANKERS

47rc030g HIS ELECTION IS ALMOST GUARANTEED
47rc030h SELLING THE CANADIAN BUSINESS WILL HELP T. L. C. GROUP COMPLETE ITS FINANCING ON THE REST OF THE BEATRICE INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS
47rc030i T. L. C. GROUP SAID YESTERDAY THAT IT HAS A FIRM COMMITMENT FROM DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT INC. ITS INVESTMENT BANKER TO FINANCE ITS ACQUISITION
47rc030j A DREXEL SPOKESMAN SAID HE EXPECTS THE FINANCING TO COME THROUGH <NOISE> A COMBINATION OF BANK LOANS AND HIGH YIELD BONDS
47rc030k DREXEL FINANCED THE KOHLBERG KRAVIS BUY OUT OF BEATRICE LAST YEAR
47rc030l I. R. E. HAS DOWNSIZED ITS REAL ESTATE SYNDICATION BUSINESS AND IS PRIMARILY A SAVINGS AND LOAN HOLDING COMPANY MR. LEVAN SAID
47rc030m EARNINGS IN THE PAST WERE SOMEWHAT ERRATIC QUARTER TO QUARTER BECAUSE OF THE MAJOR BUSINESS WAS REAL ESTATE SYNDICATION
47rc030n NOW THE S. AND L. HOLDING COMPANY IS THE MAIN BUSINESS WITH A DOWN SIZED REAL ESTATE SYNDICATION
47rc030o CORE EARNINGS ARE VERY CONSISTENT
47rc030p ANOTHER OPTION WOULD BE GOING PRIVATE IN A LEVERAGED BUY OUT
47rc030q BUT ANALYSTS SAID MANAGEMENT WOULDN'T PREFER SUCH A PLAN BECAUSE IT WOULD MEAN CURTAILING THE COMPANY'S AMBITIOUS STORE EXPANSION PROGRAM
47rc030r IN A LEVERAGED BUY OUT A SMALL GROUP OF INVESTORS ACQUIRES A COMPANY IN A TRANSACTION FINANCED LARGELY WITH BORROWING
47rc030s ULTIMATELY THE DEBT IS PAID WITH FUNDS GENERATED BY THE ACQUIRED COMPANY'S OPERATIONS <NOISE> OR THE SALE OF ITS ASSETS
47rc030t PEOPLE HE POINTS OUT COME TO HIM NOW
47rc030u THEY KNOW JESSE CAN DELIVER
47rc030v THE BOTTOM LINE IS BECOMING IF YOU WANT SOMEBODY TO COMMUNICATE WITH YOUR CHILDREN GET JESSE
47rc030w IF YOU WANT SOMEONE TO STAND UP WITH YOU AT THE FARM AUCTION OR STAND WITH YOU AT A CLOSED FACTORY GATE GET JESSE
47rc030x IT'S A REPUTATION WITH A GROWING CREDIBILITY TO IT
47rc030y A SPOKESMAN FOR CRAY DESCRIBED THE M. I. T. DECISION AS GOOD NEWS
47rc030z ASSUMING THE BIDDING DOES OPEN UP AGAIN IT MEANS THERE'S ROOM FOR TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND NOT CONSIDERATIONS BASED PURELY ON PRICE
47rc0310 THE SPOKESMAN SAID IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE FOR CRAY TO INSTALL AND OPERATE A COMPLETE SUPERCOMPUTER SYSTEM AT THE PRICES M. I. T. WANTED TO PAY
47rc0311 BUT WHILE NICKEL AND ESPECIALLY COPPER QUOTES HAVE SINCE REBOUNDED ALUMINUM PRICES HAVE CONTINUED TO TUMBLE
47rc0312 IT SEEMS TO BE IN PEOPLE'S INTEREST TO KEEP THE PRICE DOWN RIGHT NOW SAYS ONE LONDON EXCHANGE TRADER
47rc0313 THIS WILL ULTIMATELY GIVE THEM MORE BUYING OPPORTUNITIES DOWN THE LINE
47rc0314 PRICES ON UPSCALE ACURA DIVISION'S BASE MODEL CARS JUMPED EVEN HIGHER THAN HONDA DIVISION'S PRICES
47rc0315 THE ACURA INTEGRA JUMPED THREE POINT FIVE PERCENT OR THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY DOLLARS TO TEN THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN

47rc0317 <NOISE> AND THE LEGEND COUPE ROSE TWO POINT FIVE PERCENT <NOISE> OR FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY NINE DOLLARS TO TWENTY THREE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS
47rc0318 MR. PERONI AGREED THAT THE U. S. CURRENCY IS A POSITIVE FACTOR FOR STOCK PRICES
47rc0319 THE BETTER BEHAVIOR OF THE DOLLAR IS A BIG INCENTIVE FOR FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC INSTITUTIONS TO STICK BOTH FEET IN THE WATER HE SAID
47rc031a HE PREDICTED THAT THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIALS COULD BE AS HIGH AS THE UPPER TWENTY TWO HUNDREDS BY THE END OF THE SUMMER
47rc031b HOWEVER JOHN MENDELSON CHIEF MARKET ANALYST AT DEAN WITTER'S REYNOLDS BELIEVES SUCH A *SLUMP* COULD HAPPEN
47rc031c I THINK YOU WOULD GO BACK TO NORMAL TURNOVER LEVELS IN A BEAR MARKET
47rc031d <NOISE> YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR TO SEE A REAL DULL LOUSY MARKET
47rc031e TURNOVER LEVEL THAT YEAR SIXTEEN POINT FIVE PERCENT
47rc0401 THAT DECISION CAME EASILY
47rc0402 NOW HE'S WORKING AMID THE METAL FOLDING CHAIRS IN HIS TRANSITION OFFICE IN THIS AUSTERE CHAMBER OF THE SENATE EDUCATION COMMITTEE

47rc0417 NEARLY HALF LIVE IN TURKEY WHICH REFUSES EVEN TO RECOGNIZE THEM AS A DISTINCT NATIONAL MINORITY AND REFERS TO THEM ONLY AS MOUNTAIN TURKS
47rc0418 THOUGH THE KURDS OUTNUMBER THE PALESTINIANS BY A RATIO OF FIVE TO ONE THE KURDISH CAUSE HAS ATTRACTED LITTLE GLOBAL ATTENTION
47rc0419 THE RESULTS HAVE BEEN IMPRESSIVE

47sc020p <NOISE> WHILE AIDS ALSO CAUSES SOME NEUROPATHY INCLUDING BOTH DISCOMFORT AND WEAKNESS IN THE HANDS AND FEET THE DRUG'S WORST SIDE EFFECT IS THE FOOT PAIN

47sc020z BUT IF IT SUCCEEDS COMPANIES THAT HAVEN'T DISMANTLED OR SCALED BACK THEIR RESEARCH EFFORTS COULD SUDDENLY BE AHEAD OF THE COMPETITION
47sc0210 BUT EXXON CORPORATION AMOCO CORPORATION AND ATLANTIC RICHFIELD COMPANY POSTED HIGHER PROFIT
47sc0211 <NOISE> NEW YORK BASED EXXON THE NATION'S BIGGEST OIL COMPANY HAD THE SMALLEST PERCENTAGE INCREASE
47sc0212 <NOISE> ITS NET INCOME CLIMBED FIVE POINT ONE PERCENT EVEN THOUGH GAINS FROM ASSET SALES CONTRIBUTED THIRTY FOUR CENTS A SHARE TO YEAR EARLIER PROFIT

47sc0219 THE SENATE PLAN WOULD PROVIDE THIRTY MILLION FOR THE NATIONAL GUARD TO HELP THE CUSTOMS SERVICE WITH DRUG INSPECTIONS AT U. S. BORDERS
47sc021a BUT ADDITIONAL USE OF MILITARY RADAR PLANES EXPANDED NAVAL PATROLS AND MORE FREQUENT AIRCRAFT INTERCEPTIONS COULD DRAIN THE MILITARY'S ALREADY TIGHT OPERATING BUDGETS
47sc021b <NOISE> THE MEASURE DOESN'T PROVIDE ANY SPECIAL FUNDS FOR THESE OPERATIONS
47sc021c STEPHEN A. DUZAN CHAIRMAN PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER SAID IT'S OBVIOUSLY QUITE A CHANGE FROM A YEAR AGO
47sc021d IT'S OUR THIRD YEAR OF CASH FLOW AND WE'VE BEEN PROFITABLE FOR THOSE THREE OUT OF THE LAST FOUR QUARTERS
47sc021e SO WE THINK IN GENERAL THAT THIS REPRESENTS A REAL HEALTHY KIND OF PICTURE FOR A COMPANY WHOSE PRODUCTS AREN'T YET APPROVED
47sc021f THE COMPANY CURRENTLY HAS FOUR OF ITS EXPERIMENTAL PRODUCTS IN HUMAN CLINICAL TRIALS FOR DISEASES SUCH AS CANCER AND ACQUIRED IMMUNE DEFICIENCY SYNDROME
47sc0301 <NOISE> AS EXPECTED THE BUDGET WILL INCLUDE A NUMBER OF PROPOSALS THAT WERE UNSUCCESSFUL LAST YEAR INCLUDING THE SALE OF THE NAVAL PETROLEUM RESERVE AND THE BONNEVILLE POWER ADMINISTRATION
47sc0302 SOME ADMINISTRATION AND CONGRESSIONAL AIDES THINK CONGRESS WILL GO ALONG WITH SELLING THE PETROLEUM RESERVE THIS YEAR
47sc0303 BUT RESISTANCE TO THE BONNEVILLE IDEA WAS SO STRONG THAT LAWMAKERS PASSED A RESOLUTION PROHIBITING THE ADMINISTRATION FROM SPENDING ANY FEDERAL MONEY TO STUDY IT
47sc0304 WHAT EVER GENCORP DOES IT'S GOT TO BE A MASTERPIECE A VAN GOGH
47sc0305 IF THEY DO THE WRONG THING THEY'LL END UP IN PLAY AGAIN SAYS RICHARD L. HAYDON MANAGING DIRECTOR OF BREAN MURRAY FOSTER SECURITIES

47sc0307 THE POLITICAL REASONS FOR CHAIRMAN KENNEDY'S SINGLE MINDEDNESS ARE CLEAR ENOUGH
47sc0308 ORGANIZED LABOR A MAJOR DEMOCRATIC CONSTITUENCY HAS FALLEN ON HARD TIMES AS REFLECTED IN A DECLINE IN THE UNIONIZED SHARE OF THE U. S. WORK FORCE

47sc030o FIRST INTERSTATE'S FOURTH QUARTER LOSS RESULTED FROM A PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLION ADDITION TO ITS RESERVES AGAINST POSSIBLE FOREIGN DEBT LOSSES
47sc030p BUT EVEN WITHOUT THE RESERVES THE COMPANY SAID EARNINGS WOULD HAVE BEEN FLAT AT ABOUT EIGHTY FIVE MILLION COMPARED WITH THE YEAR EARLIER QUARTER
47sc030q FIRST INTERSTATE HAD A SLIGHT DECLINE IN EARNINGS ASSETS AND NEGLIGIBLE GROWTH IN NET INTEREST INCOME
47sc030r NON INTEREST INCOME FELL SEVENTEEN PERCENT PARTLY BECAUSE YEAR EARLIER RESULTS INCLUDED A NINETEEN POINT SIX MILLION PRETAX GAIN ON THE SALE OF A BUILDING

47sc030y MANY SCHOOLS ARE ENCOURAGING HOLDOUTS RESULTING IN WHAT SOME EDUCATORS CALL THE GRAYING OF KINDERGARTEN
47sc030z MR. AGEE SAID THE LOSSES WERE A DISAPPOINTMENT AND A SURPRISE TO THE BOARD TOO
47sc0310 THAT SUGGESTS THAT MR. AGEE MIGHT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT IN TO SHAKE THINGS UP
47sc0311 <NOISE> IN A TELEPHONE INTERVIEW FRIDAY MR. AGEE DIDN'T RULE ANYTHING OUT

47sc0315 MR. MINOLI THE U. S. GENERAL MANAGER SAYS BENETTON RECENTLY DROPPED ITS STRATEGY OF SATURATING THE MARKET WITH SMALL STORES
47sc0316 NOW IT IS CONCENTRATING ON PROFESSIONALISM AND THE SERVICING OF EXISTING STORES HE SAYS
47sc0317 NEW STORES WILL BE LARGER OUTLETS CALLED UNITED COLORS THAT WILL OFFER A MUCH BROADER RANGE OF MERCHANDISE
47sc0318 BENETTON PLANS TO HAVE TEN UNITED COLORS SHOPS OPERATING IN THE U. S. BY NEXT SPRING
47sc0319 MR. MINOLI ALSO ESTIMATES THAT AS MANY AS ONE HUNDRED SMALLER BENETTON STORES MAY CLOSE IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS

47sc040a A LIMITED STRIKE TARGETED AT KEY PLANTS A STRATEGY FOR THE U. A. W. USED A WEEK AGAINST G. M. IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR WOULD BUFFER THE IMPACT
47sc040b A STRIKE AGAINST A SECOND COMPANY IN CANADA WHERE THE CANADIAN AUTO WORKERS UNION IS BARGAINING INDEPENDENTLY THIS YEAR FOR THE FIRST TIME COULD BROADEN THE DAMAGE
47sc040c THE C. A. W. HAS INDICATED IT WILL TARGET A DIFFERENT AUTO MAKER THAN THE U. A. W. AND IT HAS A WIDER SELECTION
47sc040d CHRYSLER CORPORATION IS NEGOTIATING IN CANADA THIS YEAR ALTHOUGH ITS U. S. CONTRACT DOESN'T EXPIRE UNTIL NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT

47tc021d THE GLOBAL AIRLINE PREMIUMS HAVE DROPPED TO ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FROM ABOUT ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
47tc021e MEANWHILE AIRLINE LOSSES IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT ROSE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE PREVIOUS YEAR
47tc0301 CARVING UP THE BOESKY FUND WOULD EFFECTIVELY END MR. BOESKY'S INVOLVEMENT IN THE SECURITIES BUSINESS
47tc0302 MR. BOESKY FORMALLY HAS UNTIL APRIL FIRST NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT TO WIND UP HIS AFFAIRS UNDER AN AGREEMENT WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
47tc0303 BUT THE BOESKY FUND HAS ALREADY SOLD NEARLY ALL ITS STOCK POSITIONS AND A QUICKER DISSOLUTION HAS APPEARED LIKELY FOR SOME TIME
47tc0304 LONE STAR INDUSTRIES INCORPORATION SAID IT ARRANGED A ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR FINANCING THROUGH ISSUANCE OF PROMISSORY NOTES TO A GROUP OF TWENTY TWO LENDERS
47tc0305 THE EIGHT AND THREE QUARTER PERCENT NOTES WILL MATURE IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO

47tc030a WE ARE EVALUATING THE OFFERS FOR THE COMPANY AND FOR THE SHAREHOLDERS BUT WE PROFOUNDLY REGRET THE SITUATION
47tc030b THIS IS THE FIRST TEST FOR MR. RUDER'S ABILITY TO ADJUDICATE BETWEEN THE AGENCY'S PROSECUTORS AND ECONOMISTS WHICH CAN BE A FULL TIME JOB
47tc030c AS USUAL IN THE RECENT PAST THE ECONOMISTS HAVE THE BETTER ARGUMENT HERE
47tc030d THERE IS NO GOOD REASON TO OUTLAW THE OPEN MARKET PURCHASES OF SHARES IN ANY CASE AND ESPECIALLY NOT WHERE NONPROFESSIONAL SHAREHOLDERS ARE THE BIG WINNERS
47tc030e THE AUCTION HOUSE SAID THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT THE TOP TEN ART WORKS ALL SOLD FOR MORE THAN ONE MILLION DOLLARS EACH <NOISE>
47tc030f RECORDS WERE SET FOR SIX ARTISTS INCLUDING MARC CHAGALL CLAUDE MONET AND PIERRE AUGUSTE RENOIR

47tc030l I FIGURE IT WAS WORTH SIXTY FIVE DOLLARS AND EIGHTY FIVE CENTS A SHARE ON THURSDAY
47tc030m WITH FRIDAY'S REVISION IT'S WORTH SIXTY EIGHT DOLLARS A SHARE
47tc030n THE REVISED TERMS ARE NO LESS ATTRACTIVE THAN THE ORIGINAL TERMS IN THE POST CRASH MARKET
47tc030o NEVERTHELESS FIRST OPTIONS STILL LETS CUSTOMERS SUCH AS JAMES F. HART TRADE IN NAKED OUT OF THE MONEY PUTS AND CALLS

47tc030s THE COLUMBIA COMPOSITE HAS SIGNALED RECESSIONS ON THE AVERAGE BY FOURTEEN MONTHS A SOMEWHAT LONGER LEAD TIME THAN FOR THE COMMERCE INDEX
47tc030t IT IS NO SURPRISE ACCORDINGLY THAT THE COLUMBIA COMPOSITE REACHED A PEAK BEFORE THE COMMERCE INDEX IN JULY
47tc030u SINCE THEN THE COMPOSITE HAS FALLEN WITH LITTLE INTERRUPTION
47tc030v COMPUTERVISION THE PIONEER IN THE COMPUTERIZED DESIGN MARKET HAS HAD POOR FINANCIAL RESULTS IN RECENT YEARS AS IT REVAMPED ITS AGED PRODUCT LINE
47tc030w HOWEVER RECENTLY IT HAS REPORTED BETTER THAN EXPECTED EARNINGS
47tc030x ALTHOUGH IT HAS SLIPPED FROM FIRST TO THIRD IN SIZE IN THE INDUSTRY IT RETAINS A SUBSTANTIAL BASE OF CUSTOMERS
47tc030y NINETEEN NINETY NINE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN WRITTEN BY A SERVING PRESIDENT
47tc030z IT IS ALL A PRESIDENT CAN DO TO KEEP UP WITH EVENTS TIME FOR REFLECTION IS A LUXURY BEYOND REACH
47tc0310 NOR IS THERE TIME FOR A PRESIDENT TO LEARN MUCH BEYOND THE KNOWLEDGE WITH WHICH HE COMES TO OFFICE
47tc0311 THAT'S WORTH REMEMBERING WHEN WE THINK NOT ABOUT NINETEEN NINETY NINE BUT ABOUT NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT
47tc0312 FRENCH PRESIDENT MITTERRAND NAMED A LONGTIME SOCIALIST RIVAL MICHEL ROCARD AS PRIME MINISTER
47tc0313 THE FORMER AGRICULTURE MINISTER KNOWN FOR HIS FREE MARKET VIEWS SUCCEEDS JACQUES CHIRAC WHO RESIGNED FOLLOWING HIS DEFEAT IN PRESIDENTIAL BALLOTING

47tc0315 IMPERIAL SAYS IT HAS HAD TERRIFIC UNSOLICITED INTEREST IN THE MATERIAL FROM ALL AREAS OF PLASTICS USES
47tc0316 BUT THE COST OF MANUFACTURING THE NATURAL PLASTIC IS PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE FIFTEEN DOLLARS A POUND COMPARED WITH ROUGHLY SIXTY FIVE CENTS A POUND FOR CONVENTIONAL PLASTIC
47tc0317 HOWEVER THE COMPANY SAYS IT HOPES TO REDUCE MANUFACTURING COSTS ENOUGH TO BEGIN MARKETING THE PLASTIC IN TWO TO FIVE YEARS

47tc031c THESE MIXED FEELINGS OF FRUSTRATION WITH AND GRATITUDE TOWARD THE AUTHORITIES ARE PART OF THE EVERYDAY LIFE OF A FOREIGNER DOING BUSINESS IN KOREA
47tc031d IN FACT SUCH CONTRADICTIONS ARE WHAT SEEM TO MAKE THE KOREAN WORLD GO ROUND
47tc031e A WESTERN BUSINESSMAN NEEDS TO BE READY FOR THEM
47tc031f HERE ARE A FEW HARD LEARNED FACTS OF KOREAN BUSINESS LIFE
47tc0401 THE TRASH
47tc0402 PROOFS OF PURCHASE AND SALES RECEIPTS THAT HAD BEEN TURNED IN FOR CONSUMER PRODUCT REBATES AND ALREADY PAID
47tc0403 THE WOMEN RESUBMITTED THOUSANDS OF THE REBATES AND CAMOUFLAGED THEIR TRAIL BY VARYING THEIR NAMES AND USING POSTAL BOXES ALL OVER THE COUNTRY
47tc0404 UNLIKE MORE ECLECTIC RAIDERS MR. TRUMP HAS SO FAR STUCK TO REAL ESTATE
47tc0405 RESORTS HAS BIG UNDEVELOPED LAND HOLDINGS IN ATLANTIC CITY
47tc0406 ALLEGIS' WESTIN PLAZA HOTEL WHICH HE SEEMS TO WANT COULD BE WORTH TWICE AS MUCH IF MADE INTO CONDOMINIUMS HE SAYS
47tc0407 HUMANA TRIED TO DEFEND ITSELF THROUGH DIVERSIFICATION AS DID THE OTHER LARGE CHAINS HOSPITAL CORPORATION OF AMERICA AMERICAN MEDICAL INTERNATIONAL INCORPORATION AND NATIONAL MEDICAL ENTERPRISES INCORPORATION
47tc0408 THE IDEA WAS THAT IF A HOSPITAL OWNER ALSO HAD AN INSURANCE PLAN IT COULD STEER PATIENTS TO ITS INSTITUTIONS THROUGH FINANCIAL INCENTIVES
47tc0409 THE PATIENT POOL MIGHT SHRINK BUT THE COMPANY COULD GRAB A BIGGER PART OF IT
47tc040a LAST MONTH AUTO SALES FELL ONE POINT FOUR PERCENT AFTER RISING FIVE POINT SEVEN PERCENT IN AUGUST

47tc040d WALL STREET IN GENERAL HAS BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT G. M. IN RECENT WEEKS BECAUSE OF ITS NEW LABOR CONTRACT
47tc040e THE THREE YEAR PACT INCLUDES A JOB SECURITY PROGRAM THAT PREVENTS LAYOFFS EXCEPT DURING A SALES DROP PREVENTS PLANT CLOSINGS AND SLOWS ATTRITION
47tc040f MANY ANALYSTS PREDICT THE PROVISIONS WILL HAMPER G. M.'S EFFORTS TO RESTRUCTURE OPERATIONS AND SHED UNCOMPETITIVE PLANTS PARTICULARLY IN PARTS OPERATIONS
47tc040g MY CABDRIVER EYES ME IN HIS REAR VIEW MIRROR
47tc040h HIS REACTION SEEMS A LITTLE HOSTILE BUT I DON'T CARE I AM FEELING POSITIVELY VICE PRESIDENTIAL

47tc040l KEMP'S CAMPAIGN TAKES ON AN INCREASINGLY DESPERATE TONE
47tc040m IN ONE SURE SIGN OF A CANDIDACY IN TROUBLE HE LASHES OUT AT CRITICISM FROM A LIGHTLY REGARDED T. V. COMMENTATOR
47tc040n EVEN SOME SUPPORTERS NOW SAY PRIVATELY THAT HE SHOULD AIM FOR THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION

47tc040y THE INDICATED TIGHTNESS IN U. S. GASOLINE OUGHT TO PREVENT THE REFINERS' FLAT OUT PRODUCTION FROM LEADING TO A PRODUCT PRICE WAR
47tc040z <NOISE> THE DECLINE IN CRUDE PRICES EVENTUALLY WILL END HOWEVER
47tc0410 OR PRODUCT PRICES COULD AGAIN BECOME LINKED TO THOSE FOR CRUDE
47tc0411 AND GASOLINE DEMAND USUALLY DROPS AFTER LABOR DAY
47tc0412 BUT MR. RANDOL SUGGESTS THAT A TREND TOWARD PERMANENTLY IMPROVED REFINER MARGINS IS SUSTAINABLE
47tc0413 THROUGH ITS U. S. FINANCE SUBSIDIARY TOYOTA HAS ISSUED COMMERCIAL PAPER IN THE U. S. AND PRIVATELY PLACED MEDIUM TERM NOTES
47tc0414 IT HAS ALSO RAISED MORE THAN TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN THE EUROMARKETS BUT SO FAR HAS AVOIDED ISSUING STRAIGHT DEBT IN THE PUBLIC U. S. MARKET
47tc0415 THE SAME IS TRUE OF MOST JAPANESE COMPANIES
47tc0416 RANDOM HOUSE A SUBSIDIARY OF NEWHOUSE FAMILY'S ADVANCE PUBLICATIONS INCORPORATED SAID THE MOVE WILL TAKE IT OUT OF THE TEXTBOOK PUBLISHING BUSINESS

47uc020b A. Z. T. IS MARKETED UNDER THE NAME RETROVIR BY BURROUGHS WELLCOME COMPANY AT AN ANNUAL RETAIL DOSAGE COST OF ABOUT TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS
47uc020c IT ALSO IS THE MOST EXPENSIVE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PROMPTING FEARS THAT SOME I- INSURERS WHO NORMALLY PROVIDE PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE WILL BALK AT ITS PRICE
47uc020d MR. BOTHA ALSO MUST RULE ON THE FATE OF THE GROUP AREAS ACT
47uc020e VIOLATIONS OF THE ACT ARE RAMPANT BUT THERE WERE ONLY FOUR PROSECUTIONS UNDER IT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX ONE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE AND NONE THE YEAR BEFORE
47uc020f A RECENT POLL BY THE AFRIKAANS NEWSPAPER RAPPORT FOUND THAT ONLY TWENTY SEVEN PERCENT OF SURVEYED WHITES WANT THE ACT RETAINED
47uc020g MORE THAN TWENTY FOUR PERCENT WANT IT SCRAPPED COMPLETELY WHILE ANOTHER THIRTY FOUR PERCENT WANT EACH LOCAL COMMUNITY OR PROPERTY OWNER TO DECIDE WHO CAN RENT OR BUY HOUSING
47uc020h ON THE BIG BOARD VOLUME ROSE TO TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY POINT FIVE MILLION SHARES FROM A HUNDRED AND SIXTY EIGHT POINT SIX MILLION THURSDAY
47uc020i BUT THE ACTIVITY WAS LESS THAN ON PREVIOUS TRIPLE WITCHING DAYS AND MUCH OF THE TRADING WAS PACKED INTO THE OPENING AND CLOSING MINUTES OF THE SESSION
47uc020j MORE THAN THIRTY ONE MILLION SHARES CHANGED HANDS IN THE FINAL MINUTE

47uc020o PEOPLE IN FIFTY ONE FOREIGN COUNTRIES ENJOYED THE EVENTS VIA TELEVISION
47uc020p THE FRENCH WERE SO IMPRESSED BY THE CELEBRATION THEY THANKED THE U. S. IN AN AD IN A NEW YORK NEWSPAPER
47uc020q <NOISE> IN THE END THERE IS LITTLE THE U. S. CAN DO TO CONTROL EVENTS IN SOUTH AFRICA
47uc020r THE ADMINISTRATION'S SIX YEAR CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT POLICY DESIGNED TO COAX PRETORIA TOWARD DISMANTLING APARTHEID DIDN'T SUCCEED
47uc020s AND SANCTIONS IN THE SHORT RUN WON'T DAMAGE SOUTH AFRICA'S SELF RELIANT ECONOMY

47uc020w THE THIRD REVIEW WAS DUE BY OCTOBER THIRD NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
47uc020x THE MOST OPTIMISTIC ESTIMATES ARE NOW THAT IT WILL START SOMETIME AFTER THE FIRST OF THE YEAR
47uc020y THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION IN SHORT IS CONSPIRING WITH THE SOVIETS TO VIOLATE THE REVIEW PROVISIONS OF THE TREATY
47uc020z IT IS SAD BUT TRUE THAT INTERNATIONAL SPORTING EXTRAVAGANZAS HAVE COME TO BE CONDUCTED AMID THE SORT OF SECURITY OTHERWISE RESERVED FOR THE TRAVELS OF HEADS OF STATE

47uc0213 LAST WEEK COMMON CAUSE CALLED FOR AN INVESTIGATION OF MR. WRIGHT'S FINANCES
47uc0214 THE SPEAKER RETALIATED IN A PUBLIC STATEMENT AND HIS MINIONS IN THE LEADERSHIP SAID THE GROUP WAS DEAD ON CAPITOL HILL
47uc0215 THIS WAS ROUGH ON ALL DEBTORS DOMESTIC AS WELL AS INTERNATIONAL
47uc0216 BUT NO ONE PROPOSED SOLUTIONS FOR DOMESTIC DEBTORS AS GRAND AS THOSE OFFICIALLY OFFERED FOR THIRD WORLD DEBTORS
47uc0217 THE FIRST PART OF THE OFFICIAL PROPOSAL WAS TO REDUCE THE IN- INTEREST BURDEN OF THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
47uc0218 SECOND PROMOTE WORLD ECONOMIC RECOVERY
47uc0219 THIRD NEW LOANS SHOULD BE MADE TO THE DEBTOR NATIONS BY THE BANKS THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND THE WORLD BANK AND EXPORT CREDIT AGENCIES
47uc021a IN ANY CASE A RETURN TO MARKET DISCIPLINE IS INEVITABLE

47uc021d THESE PROBLEMS OF THE RECENT PAST PALE IN SCOPE NEXT TO THE PERVASIVENESS AND TOTAL DOLLARS INVOLVED IN THE CURRENT CRAZE
47uc021e IF THE PARTICIPANTS IN THIS CRAZE AWAKEN NOW THE CORRECTION MAY STILL BE WITHIN TOLERABLE LIMITS FOR THE COUNTRY
47uc021f IF NOT ALL OF AMERICA WILL PAY THE PENALTY BECAUSE THE DEBT IS HUGE AND WIDELY HELD AND THE BANKING STRUCTURE'S INTEGRITY WOULD BE AT STAKE

47uc0302 THERE IS SOME CAUSE FOR OPTIMISM
47uc0303 SHE SAID EXPORT GAINS HAVE SPURRED SOME OF THE IMPROVEMENT
47uc0304 IT'S SO SHUNNED THAT ALTHOUGH MOST MANAGERS GOING UP THE LADDER ARE OCCASIONALLY REQUIRED TO FIRE ONCE HAVING ASCENDED TO THE TOP THEY DELEGATE THE JOB
47uc0305 ANDREW SHERWOOD A NEW YORK MANAGEMENT CONSULTANT SAYS THAT ONLY ABOUT FIVE PERCENT OF CHIEF EXECUTIVES DO THEIR OWN FIRING
47uc0306 THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE COMPULSIVE BUILDERS HE SAYS
47uc0307 THEY LIKE ACQUIRING COMPANIES MAKING PROFITS GO UP AND RECRUITING PEOPLE
47uc0308 FIRING ISN'T WHAT THEY'RE EMOTIONALLY GEARED FOR
47uc0309 THEY FIND IT REPUGNANT
47uc030a DEFENDERS OF THE FOOTNOTE ARGUE THAT IT MAKES SENSE AS TAX POLICY
47uc030b WHY THEY ASK SHOULD WEALTHY BEST SELLING AUTHORS GET SUBSTANTIAL TAX DEFERRALS WHILE MOM AND POP MANUFACTURERS FOR EXAMPLE CAN'T
47uc030c AS A RULE OF TAXES IT'S A GOOD RULE BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT PEOPLE TAKING DEDUCTIONS BEFORE THEY GET THE INCOME SAYS ONE CONGRESSIONAL AIDE
47uc030d IT'S THE TIME VALUE OF MONEY PRINCIPLE
47uc030e MR. AMMAN FORTY NINE YEARS OLD SAID HE BELIEVES WESTERN UNION'S DEBT AND EQUITY HOLDERS WILL SUPPORT THE RESTRUCTURING
47uc030f HE ADDED THAT THE RESTRUCTURING MUST BE COMPLETED IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS BECAUSE THE COMPANY IS RUNNING SHORT OF CASH
47uc030g WESTERN UNION HAS SAID THAT IF ITS PLANS ARE DEFEATED IT WILL FILE FOR REORGANIZATION UNDER CHAPTER ELEVEN OF THE FEDERAL BANKRUPTCY LAWS
47uc030h THE CONFRONTATION IN FEDERAL COURT MAY BREAK NEW GROUND IN BANKRUPTCY LAW
47uc030i OTHER COURTS NOTABLY THE ONE IN CHARGE OF THE MANVILLE CORPORATION CHAPTER ELEVEN PROCEEDINGS HAVE SET UP TRUST FUNDS TO PAY LARGE CLASSES OF INJURY VICTIMS
47uc030j BUT MANVILLE'S TWO POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS TO THREE BILLION DOLLAR TRUST INCLUDES PROVISIONS THAT ALLOW IT TO EXPAND IF FUNDS PROVE INADEQUATE TO PAY ASBESTOS RELATED CLAIMS

47uc031a HE WOULD HAVE INCURRED THE WRATH OF THE RIGHT TO LIFE MOVEMENT AND I WOULD HAVE BEEN THE ENEMY MR. FULTON SAYS

47uc0405 ALSO A FOUR MILLION DOLLAR SHORT TERM LOAN FROM XEROX CORPORATION WAS CONVERTED INTO A LONG TERM NOTE
47uc0406 THE NOTE IS CONVERTIBLE INTO TANDON COMMON STOCK
47uc0407 LIKE THEIR ECONOMIES THE CURRENCIES OF THE U. S. AND CANADA ARE CLOSELY RELATED
47uc0408 BUT AS INTEREST RATES RISE IN CANADA THE CANADIAN DOLLAR IS GAINING ON ITS U. S. COUNTERPART TRADERS AND ANALYSTS SAY
47uc0409 AND AS THE CANADIAN UNIT RISES IT LURES MORE FOREIGN INVESTMENT PARTICULARLY FROM JAPAN WHICH ADDS TO ITS STRENGTH
47uc040a MR. CRUZ SAID HE HAD SET DEADLINES FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE REFORMS HE WAS PROPOSING

47vc0313 STILL MS. FREEDMAN NOTED THAT A BRIGHT FORECAST FOR HIRING ISN'T NECESSARILY ALL GOOD NEWS
47vc0314 <NOISE> THE INCREASING USE OF LABOR MAY BE BECAUSE OF A TREMENDOUS BOOM IN THE OUTPUT OF GOODS AND SERVICES SHE SAID
47vc0315 BUT IT ALSO MIGHT BE BECAUSE YOU AREN'T IMPROVING THE EFFICIENCY WITH WHICH YOU USE THE LABOR FORCE THE PRODUCTIVITY
47vc0316 RICHARD ROSLUND A VICE PRESIDENT OF BLOCK TRADING AT KIDDER PEABODY SAID THE FED CHAIRMAN'S REMARKS GAVE THE MARKET A REASON TO ADOPT A MORE POSITIVE OUTLOOK

47vc040v STANFORD NOW CHOOSES NOT TO REQUIRE ITS UNDERGRADUATES TO STUDY THEIR WESTERN HERITAGE BUT THAT HISTORY DOES YIELD CERTAIN LESSONS
47vc040w ONE OF THEM IS THAT MINORITIES THAT DO NOT RESPOND EFFECTIVELY TO ATTACKS FROM THE MAJORITY MERELY ENCOURAGE FURTHER ASSAULTS
47vc040x PERHAPS THE HOOVER OVERSEERS SHOULD KEEP THAT IN MIND WHEN THEY PONDER THE LATEST AFFRONT TO GLENN CAMPBELL NEXT WEEK

47wc0303 AND THE MOST COMMON RESPONSE TO SUPERMARKET TASTE TESTS WAS THAT THE CHEESE LOOKED AND TASTED LIKE SOAP SHE RECALLS
47wc0304 BUT SHE KEPT GOING PEDDLING HER PIZZAS TO RESTAURANTS AND FANCY HOTELS
47wc0305 SMOKERS ARE FEELING THE HEAT BECAUSE COMPANIES ARE TAKING A HARDER LINE ON SUCH ISSUES AS PRODUCTIVITY RISING MEDICAL COSTS AND THE EFFECTS OF PASSIVE SMOKE
47wc0306 ALTHOUGH THERE ARE CONFLICTING CLAIMS ABOUT WHETHER SMOKERS COST EMPLOYERS MORE IN TERMS OF HIGHER INSURANCE RATES AND ABSENTEEISM COMPANIES OFTEN CITE SUCH CONCERNS TO JUSTIFY RESTRICTIVE SMOKING POLICIES
47wc0307 IN ADDITION NEW STATE AND LOCAL ORDINANCES AND EMPLOYEE COMPLAINTS PUT SIGNIFICANT PRESSURE ON MANY COMPANIES
47wc0308 THE GOVERNMENT CIVIL SUIT ALLEGED THAT A DEFECT COULD CAUSE THE REAR BRAKES TO LOCK SENDING THE CAR SPINNING OUT OF CONTROL
47wc0309 <NOISE> G. M. WHICH NO LONGER MAKES X. CARS DENIED THAT THE BRAKES ARE DEFECTIVE
47wc030a AGREEING WITH G. M. JUDGE JACKSON RULED THAT THE GOVERNMENT CAME TO COURT WITH NOTHING MORE ESSENTIALLY THAN A REASONABLE SUSPICION THAT A DEFECT EXISTED
47wc030b THE SUIT WHICH ALSO NAMES THE COMPANY'S DIRECTORS AS DEFENDANTS SAYS THE DIRECTORS HAVE GIVEN PERSONAL GAIN A PRIORITY OVER THE INTERESTS OF PUBLIC SHAREHOLDERS
47wc030c A SECOND SUIT BY MOSHE J. SCHWARTZ JEFFREY ABRAMS STANLEY HEINEMAN AND JAMES T. CAIN CONTAINS COMPARABLE CHARGES
47wc030d EARLIER AT LEAST TWO OF THOSE SAME PLAINTIFFS FILED A SUIT OVER THE ANTAR STOCK SALES
47wc030e A LOSS WASN'T UNEXPECTED GIVEN CONTINENTAL'S OPERATIONAL DIFFICULTIES THAT DEVELOPED IN THE QUARTER
47wc030f HOWEVER THE RESULTS OF TEXAS AIR'S SUBSIDIARIES ARE THE REVERSE OF WHAT MANY ANALYSTS HAD PREDICTED EARLIER IN THE YEAR
47wc030g INSTEAD OF A MODEST PROFIT AT LOW COST CONTINENTAL BY THE SECOND QUARTER THE NEWLY EXPANDED UNIT HAS STRUGGLED WITH LOSSES
47wc030h ITS HIGHER COST SISTER EASTERN AIRLINES HAS SHOWN SIGNS OF FINANCIAL PROGRESS DESPITE CONTINUING CONFRONTATIONS WITH ITS EMPLOYEE UNIONS
47wc030i MR. LAY SAID THE LOSSES OCCURED IN LATE SEPTEMBER AND EARLY THIS MONTH A TIME OF PARTICULAR VOLATILITY IN OIL MARKETS
47wc030j THERE WERE TWO SENIOR PEOPLE COLLUDING AND KEEPING A SEPARATE SET OF BOOKS APART FROM THE OFFICIAL BOOKS FOR A FEW WEEKS MR. LAY SAID
47wc030k THEIR GUESSES WERE WRONG ON BOTH SIDES OF THE MARKET
47wc030l AN F. T. C. SPOKESMAN DECLINED TO COMMENT
47wc030m THE INVESTIGATION WAS FIRST REPORTED IN F. T. C. WATCH A PUBLICATION ABOUT REGULATORY MATTERS
47wc030n REACHED IN NEW YORK LAST NIGHT MR. TRUMP CONFIRMED THAT THE F. T. C. HAD MADE THE REQUEST
47wc030o HE DECLINED TO ELABORATE
47wc030p SEPARATELY WALL STREET SPECULATION GREW THAT MEDIA INVESTOR RUPERT MURDOCH WAS CONSIDERING ACQUIRING A STAKE IN LONDON BASED W. P. P.
47wc030q A MURDOCH AIDE SAID THAT MR. MURDOCH HAS BEEN LOOKING FOR A LONG TIME AT THE COMPANY
47wc030r BUT A W. P. P. SPOKESMAN SAID THAT THERE HAS BEEN NO CONTACT AND THERE HAS BEEN NO ACQUISITION OF W. P. P. SHARES BY MURDOCH
47wc030s YESTERDAY PEOPLE CLOSE TO FEDERATED'S BOARD SAID THAT THE COMPANY WAS STILL OPEN TO YET ANOTHER FRIENDLY MERGER PROPOSAL FROM CAMPEAU
47wc030t IF THEY'VE GOT SOMETHING TO SHOW US WE'LL TAKE A LOOK AT IT
47wc030u THEY KNOW WHERE TO FIND US SAID ONE SOURCE
47wc030v WE'RE NOT STONEWALLING THEM
47wc030w I CAN'T GUARANTEE OUR GROUP IS A HUNDRED PERCENT SOLID SAID AN OFFICIAL AT SUEZ A FRENCH HOLDING COMPANY
47wc030x I CAN'T TELL YOU THAT AT THOSE PRICES THERE WON'T BE ANY RENEGING ON AGREEMENTS SIGNED BY THE CONSORTIUM'S MEMBERS
47wc030y BUT HE ADDED SUCH ACTIONS COULD LEAD TO A LEGAL REPRISALS
47wc030z BOTH SIDES HAVE WORKED HARD AND SOME PROGRESS HAS BEEN REALIZED IN A NUMBER OF AREAS SAID MESSRS.
47wc0310 SHULTZ AND SHEVARDNADZE IN A JOINT STATEMENT LAST NIGHT
47wc0311 BUT MUCH MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE
47wc0312 THE UNITED NATIONS WHOSE GARBAGE BILL IS FORTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH IS SERVED BY NATIONAL CARTING COMPANY WHICH WON THE PICKUP RIGHTS EIGHT YEARS AGO
47wc0313 LAST DECEMBER THE U. N. DIDN'T ATTEMPT TO SOLICIT BIDS
47wc0314 IT SIMPLY EXTENDED ITS CONTRACT WITH NATIONAL CARTING
47wc0315 SOLICITING BIDS IN THIS PARTICULAR INDUSTRY IS NOT THE WAY TO GO A U. N. SPOKESMAN SAYS IMPLYING THAT IT IS FUTILE
47wc0316 BUT CRITICS CHARGED THAT THE COLLAR ACTUALLY ADDED TO VOLATILITY BY MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR INDEX *ARBITRAGERS* TO DO THEIR BUSINESS
47wc0317 MANY TRADERS ARGUE THAT SUCH ARBITRAGE HAS THE EFFECT OF SMOOTHING OUT VOLATILITY IN THE MARKETS
47wc0318 INDEX ARBITRAGERS BUY AND SELL LARGE AMOUNTS OF STOCKS AND STOCK INDEX FUTURES TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF BRIEF PRICE DISPARITIES BETWEEN THE TWO RELATED INSTRUMENTS
47wc0319 THE SCENE THE ANNUAL NORMAN MAILER COCKTAIL PARTY AND FIST FIGHT
47wc031a CANDICE BERGEN AND WOODY ALLEN HAD JUST JOINED A GROUP OF PSEUDO INTELLECTUALS AND WERE RAMBLING WITH THE BEST OF THEM
47wc031b I OFTEN THINK OBSERVED MS. BERGEN THAT IF DOSTOEVSKI HAD BEEN A SINGER HE'D HAVE SOUNDED LIKE RAY CHARLES
47wc031c THE OTHER NON WINNERS MOST NOTABLY EXXON WERE IN MANY WAYS AS NOTEWORTHY AS THE WINNERS
47wc031d IT IS BELIEVED THAT EXXON WAS OUTBID FOR SEVERAL RESERVE PACKAGES LEAVING IT WITH A LOT OF CASH THAT COULD STILL BE EARMARKED FOR ACQUISITIONS
47wc031e AT THE HOUSTON PETROLEUM CLUB INDUSTRY OFFICIALS COULDN'T EAT LUNCH OF LATE WITHOUT DISCUSSING SPECULATION THAT EXXON WAS GOING TO WALK AWAY WITH ALL OF THE TENNECO PROPERTIES
47wc031f AN EXXON *SPOKESWOMAN* SAID IT WAS COMPANY POLICY NOT TO COMMENT ON ANYTHING TO DO WITH ACQUISITIONS
47wc0401 ALSO SELLING WELL WAS A FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR ISSUE OF REVENUE BONDS BY THE FLORIDA DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES
47wc0402 THE UNSOLD BALANCE WAS ABOUT TEN POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS
47wc0403 THE BONDS WERE PRICED AFTER AUCTION TO YIELD FROM FOUR POINT TWO PERCENT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT TO SEVEN POINT TWO PERCENT IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE
47wc0404 MOODY'S RATED THE BONDS SINGLE A. WHILE S. AND P. RATED THEM SINGLE A. MINUS
47wc0405 GOLDMAN SACHS AND COMPANY WAS THE LEAD UNDERWRITER
47wc0406 STILL HE WOULD HAVE PREFERRED THERE BE NO BIDS AT ALL
47wc0407 THE COMPANY'S POLICY FOR EIGHTY FIVE YEARS HAS BEEN TO BE INDEPENDENT AND GROW AND WE HAVE SUCCEEDED HE SAYS
47wc0408 WE ARE EVALUATING THE OFFERS FOR THE COMPANY AND FOR THE SHAREHOLDERS BUT WE PROFOUNDLY REGRET THE SITUATION
47wc0409 SO STRANGE IS THE SITUATION THAT ONE HOLLY DIRECTOR HAS PROPOSED CHANGING THE COMPANY'S NAME TO FANTASY SUGAR COMPANY
47wc040a HE SAYS THAT COULD ENTICE SHAMROCK BECAUSE OF ITS DISNEY CONNECTION TO BUY THE COMPANY
47wc040b JUST THINK OF HOW MUCH THEY COULD MAKE ON THE MOVIE RIGHTS HE ADDS
47wc040c DURING THE PAST SEVERAL DAYS CORPORATIONS AND OTHER BIG INVESTORS HAVE REFRAINED FROM LENDING TREASURY BONDS AND NOTES TO SECURITIES DEALERS FOR BRIEF PERIODS
47wc040d THAT IN TURN HAS FORCED MANY DEALERS TO REFRAIN FROM SELLING BORROWED SECURITIES OR AMASSING SO CALLED SHORT POSITIONS
47wc040e IT'S HARD TO SHORT ANYTHING IN THIS MARKET AT THE MOMENT SAID A TRADER AT A LARGE GOVERNMENT SECURITIES DEALER
47wc040f MR. ANTONIU DENIES ANY WRONGDOING
47wc040g I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO WORRY ABOUT THE FORMER INVESTMENT BANKER SAYS
47wc040h I HAVE ALWAYS FOLLOWED THE ADVICE OF MY LAWYER AND ACCOUNTANTS
47wc040i HE SAYS THAT HE HAS COOPERATED IN AN INQUIRY BY FLORIDA OFFICIALS BUT THAT HE ISN'T AWARE THE MATTER HAS BEEN REFERRED TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE
47wc040j IN ANY CASE HE SAYS SPORT ABOUT'S PROBLEMS WILL BE CURED BY THE PUBLIC OFFERING AND ARE COMMONPLACE IN ANY RAPIDLY GROWING FRANCHISE BUSINESS
47wc040k WHERE CAN WE FIND SOME CLUES TO THE ANSWER OR AT LEAST A POSSIBLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION
47wc040l I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WE LOOK AT THE ONE MARXIST LENINIST STATE THAT ALREADY HAS GONE QUITE FAR DOWN THE REVISIONIST ROAD
47wc040m I REFER TO THE CURIOUSLY NEGLECTED INSTANCE OF YUGOSLAVIA
47wc040n OUTSIDE OF THE CONGRESSIONAL LEADERSHIP PATIENCE IS WEARING THIN ON PORK BARRELING CONTINUING RESOLUTIONS
47wc040o THERE ARE EVEN CONGRESSMEN WHO SAY THEY WANT TO PASS SEPARATE BUDGET BILLS THIS YEAR
47wc040p WE'LL SEE
47wc040q WHAT SEEMS MORE LIKELY IS THAT EITHER A PRESIDENT OR THE COURTS OR BOTH SOMEDAY WILL HAVE TO RESCUE THE VETO BY FORCING CONGRESS TO GIVE UP ITS ARROGANT WAYS
47wc040r <NOISE> SO FAR WE'VE FOUND THAT FEDERAL EMPLOYEES HAVE DEALT WITH THIS ISSUE WITH A GREAT DEAL OF SENSITIVITY AND COMMON SENSE MRS. HORNER SAID
47wc040s BUT THERE IS A NEED FOR CLARITY
47wc040t THESE GUIDELINES WILL SERVE AS REASSURANCE TO OUR MANAGERS
47wc040u SENATOR BENTSEN'S CORPORATE TAX PROPOSAL WOULD REPLACE A PROVISION IN THE COMMITTEE BILL ALLOWING THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE TO WITHHOLD REFUNDS FROM TAXPAYERS WHO HAVE DEFAULTED ON GOVERNMENT LOANS
47wc040v THIS PROVISION WOULDN'T RAISE ANY MONEY IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR AND SENATOR BENTSEN WANTED SOMETHING THAT WOULD ALLOW A QUICKER END TO THE DIESEL TAX COLLECTION
47wc040w THE TEXAS DEMOCRAT PLANS TO OFFER HIS SUBSTITUTION WHEN THE TAX PACKAGE REACHES THE SENATE FLOOR
47wc040x MAKERS WORLD WIDE HAVE BEEN RACING TO DEVELOP COMPACT DISK RECORDERS
47wc040y MANY BIG JAPANESE STEREO MAKERS INCLUDING NAMES LIKE SANYO AND SONY HAVE BEEN WORKING FOR YEARS TO DEVELOP SOMETHING AKIN TO TANDY'S NEW TECHNOLOGY
47wc040z LIKE TANDY'S THOSE MACHINES ARE ABOUT TWO YEARS AWAY ANALYSTS SAY
47wc0410 COMPACT DISK RECORDERS THAT C- STORE COMPUTER DATA RATHER THAN SOUND ARE EXPECTED OUT THIS YEAR
47wc0411 <NOISE> UNION PACIFIC CORPORATION HAS ROLLED TWO CLUB CARS INTO TOWN TO ENTERTAIN DEMOCRATS
47wc0412 THE COMPANY IS HEADED BY DREW LEWIS FREQUENTLY A TROUBLESHOOTER FOR THE REPUBLICANS
47wc0413 THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF *REALTORS* IS THROWING SEVERAL PARTIES AND PROUDLY BOASTS THAT EIGHTY NINE OF ITS MEMBERS ARE DELEGATES OR ALTERNATES TO THIS CONVENTION
47wc0414 DISCUSSION OF THIS SUBJECT BETTER DESCRIBED AS BROODING ABOUT IT IS FILLED WITH MISCONCEPTIONS
47wc0415 ONE OF THESE IS THE GREAT CONCERN WITH THE U. S. HAVING BECOME A NET DEBTOR
47wc0416 WHAT IS MEANT BY THAT IS THAT AMERICANS APPARENTLY OWN FEWER ASSETS ABROAD THAN FOREIGNERS OWN IN THE U. S.
47wc0417 MANY PEOPLE HAVE POINTED OUT THAT THESE CALCULATIONS ARE SPURIOUS BECAUSE THE ASSETS ARE NOT ALL VALUED ON THE SAME BASIS
47wc0418 IF ALL ASSETS WERE VALUED AT TODAY'S PRICES THE NET DEBT OF THE U. S. WOULD CERTAINLY BE MUCH SMALLER THAN IT NOW APPEARS AND MIGHT BE A NET ASSET
47wc0419 INVESTORS TAKING PART IN THE FINANCING WILL LEND VENEZUELA ONE BILLION IN EXCHANGE FOR MONTHLY PAYMENTS FROM THE NEW YORK TRUST FUND
47wc041a THOSE PAYMENTS WILL BE SET WHEN THE FINANCING IS COMPLETED WHICH IS EXPECTED IN MID DECEMBER
47wc041b THE INTEREST RATE WILL BE BASED ON THE FIVE YEAR U. S. TREASURY BOND RATE PLUS A STILL UNDECIDED INTEREST RATE MARGIN THE VENEZUELAN OFFICIAL SAID
47wc041c INVESTORS CONTINUE TO FLOCK TO THE MORE CONSERVATIVE STOCK PORTFOLIOS
47wc041d GROWTH AND INCOME FUNDS WHICH COMBINE HEFTY DIVIDENDS WITH THE GOAL OF CAPITAL APPRECIATION LED ALL OTHER STOCK FUND CATEGORIES IN SALES FOR JUNE
47wc041e AMONG BOND FUNDS LONG TERM MUNICIPAL FUNDS CAPTURED THE TOP SPOT
47xc0201 I'M VERY NERVOUS BECAUSE MY VIEW ON RATES IS SO CLOSE TO THE CONSENSUS EDWARD HYMAN OF CYRUS J. LAWRENCE INC. SAYS
47xc0202 REMEMBER THE CONSENSUS USUALLY IS WRONG
47xc0203 <NOISE> THE MARKETS SEEM DETERMINED TO MAKE AS MANY ECONOMISTS LOOK AS STUPID AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN
47xc0204 I WAS STARTLED STARTLED ISN'T THE WORD REACTED ALVIN NOVICK A BIOLOGY PROFESSOR AT YALE UNIVERSITY
47xc0205 HE WARNED THAT FORCED TESTING SUCH AS CONTEMPLATED BY THE CENTERS <NOISE> WOULD DRIVE HOMOSEXUALS UNDERGROUND AND AWAY FROM COOPERATION WITH PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAMS
47xc0206 RATIONAL PEOPLE WON'T COOPERATE IN RUINING THEIR OWN LIVES HE SAID
47xc0207 LOCAL NEWSPAPERS YESTERDAY SAID THE GOVERNMENT MAY QUALIFY THE DECISION TO SIGN THE RESTRUCTURING AGREEMENT
47xc0208 BUT OFFICIAL SOURCES SAID THE SIGNING IS LIKELY TO TAKE PLACE DURING THE LAST WEEK IN SEPTEMBER
47xc0209 THE SIGNING DEADLINE IS OCTOBER FIRST
47xc020a <NOISE> OTHER TOY MAKERS SUCH AS MATTEL INC. HAVE BEEN BRINGING OUT NEW PRODUCTS EARLIER IN THE YEAR TO INCREASE SALES AT TIMES OTHER THAN CHRISTMAS
47xc020b BUT TYCO'S DAY AFTER CHRISTMAS LAUNCH IS UNUSUAL
47xc020c THE TOY BUSINESS IS RIPE FOR SOME MARKETING INNOVATION AFTER TWO YEARS OF RELATIVELY FLAT SALES SAYS RICK ANGUILLA EDITOR OF TOY AND HOBBY WORLD MAGAZINE
47xc020d IF TYCO SUCCEEDS OTHERS WILL CERTAINLY FOLLOW
47xc020e NO ONE SEEMS QUITE SURE HOW THE PUBLISHER JUGGLES HIS ASSETS AMONG HIS VARIOUS COMPANIES WHICH INCLUDE THE PUBLICLY OWNED MAXWELL COMMUNICATION CORP. AND VARIOUS PRIVATE ONES
47xc020f CONTROL OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY AND OF PRIVATE INTERESTS LIKE MIRROR GROUP NEWSPAPERS LIMITED RESTS WITH A FOUNDATION IN LIECHTENSTEIN PERGAMON HOLDING FOUNDATION ABOUT WHICH LITTLE IS DISCLOSED
47xc020g HE SAYS ITS BENEFICIARIES ARE CHARITIES WHICH HE PROMISES TO IDENTIFY SOMEDAY SOON
47xc020h THE BANK OF ITALY ALSO REPORTEDLY SOLD MARKS TO BUY ITALIAN LIRE
47xc020i THE TRANSACTIONS MAY HAVE BEEN DIRECTED MAINLY AT DEFENDING THE SAGGING LIRA IN THE EUROPEAN MONETARY SYSTEM IN WHICH EIGHT EUROPEAN CURRENCIES FLOAT WITHIN SPECIFIED LIMITS
47xc020j BUT THEY ALSO HAD THE EFFECT OF HELPING THE DOLLAR BY INCREASING THE SUPPLY OF MARKS IN THE MARKET
47xc020k <NOISE> FOR ENVIRONMENTAL TREATMENT WHICH LIKE MR. KIRK RELISHES AN EXTREMELY LOW PROFILE THE OIL SPILL HAS BROUGHT A WAVE OF ATTENTION
47xc020l IN FACT WHEN WALL STREET LEARNED THAT THE PUBLICLY HELD COMPANY WAS HIRED TO HANDLE THE MULTIMILLION DOLLAR CLEANUP THE CONCERN'S STOCK SHOT UP ALMOST U- TEN PERCENT
47xc020m YESTERDAY IN NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE COMPOSITE TRADING ITS STOCK CLOSED AT TWELVE DOLLARS DOWN TWENTY FIVE CENTS

47xc020p DOWN THE STREET FROM MR. SANCHEZ'S SHOP CARLOS A GOVERNMENT MECHANIC SAYS HE GOES TO MANY PRO NORIEGA DEMONSTRATIONS
47xc020q THE IMPACT WILL BE ENORMOUS
47xc020r THE REPUBLICANS' STRONGEST CASE AGAINST THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE HIS NAIVETE ON NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUES WILL DISAPPEAR <NOISE>
47xc020s THE SUSPICION OF A SELECTION BASED ENTIRELY ON POLITICAL INSTEAD OF SUBSTANTIVE GROUNDS WILL BE UNDERCUT
47xc020t AND A MESSAGE THAT THE CURRENT VICE PRESIDENT IS LARGELY IRRELEVANT WILL BE STRONGLY DELIVERED
47xc020u MR. TUCKER'S HARD HITTING CAMPAIGN HAS IN TURN APPALLED TOP UNION LEADERS WHO SAY HE HAS TARNISHED THEIR REPUTATION AS ONE OF THE LABOR MOVEMENT'S CLEANEST ORGANIZATIONS
47xc020v THE STATEMENTS OF AN UNDEMOCRATIC UNION BEING IN BED WITH MANAGEMENT HURTS THIS UNION SAID MR. BIEBER
47xc020w I RESENT THOSE STATEMENTS
47xc020x MR. DELCHAMPS SAID THIRTY PERCENT OF THE COMPANY'S STOCK OUTSTANDING IS HELD BY PEOPLE WHO HAVE AGREED NOT TO SELL THEIR HOLDINGS BEFORE OCTOBER THIRTY FIRST
47xc020y ANOTHER TWENTY FIVE PERCENT IS HELD UNDER THE COMPANY'S EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN
47xc020z MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN THE FORMER CATEGORY ARE EXPECTED TO EXTEND THE NO SELL AGREEMENT FOR ANOTHER YEAR HE SAID
47xc0210 O. T. C. BROKERS ALSO STRESS THAT THEIR STOCKS OFTEN OUTPERFORM LISTED ONES ON A N- LONG TERM BASIS
47xc0211 AND OVERALL THE NASDAQ COMPOSITE INDEX IS UP THIRTEEN PERCENT THIS YEAR TWICE AS MUCH AS THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE
47xc0212 ALSO THEY NOTE THE TINY STOCKS THAT GENERALLY TRADE UNDER THREE DOLLARS A SHARE HAVE ALWAYS TAKEN BIG PERCENTAGE MOVES UP OR DOWN WHEN THEY MOVE AT ALL
47xc0213 THESE MIXED FEELINGS OF FRUSTRATION WITH AND GRATITUDE TOWARD THE AUTHORITIES ARE PART OF THE EVERYDAY LIFE OF A FOREIGNER DOING BUSINESS IN KOREA
47xc0214 IN FACT SUCH CONTRADICTIONS ARE WHAT SEEM TO MAKE THE KOREAN WORLD GO ROUND
47xc0215 A WESTERN BUSINESSMAN NEEDS TO BE READY FOR THEM
47xc0216 HERE ARE A F:EW HARD LEARNED FACTS OF KOREAN BUSINESS LIFE
47xc0217 THERE ARE ALSO BROKER FINDERS THAT GET FEES MERELY FOR MATCHING BORROWERS AND LENDERS OF STOCK
47xc0218 BROKER FINDERS CAN ALSO INCLUDE THE BROKERAGE FIRMS THEMSELVES
47xc0219 THE GOVERNMENT IS INVESTIGATING WHETHER ALL THE PAYMENTS THAT FLY TO AND FROM SUCH BROKER FINDERS ARE LEGITIMATE
47xc021a <NOISE> WE ARE EXTREMELY SELECTIVE SAID PAUL SUCKROW DIRECTOR OF FIXED INCOME AT OPPENHEIMER MANAGEMENT CORPORATION
47xc021b <NOISE> I DON'T THINK SOME ISSUES ARE GOING TO MAKE IT HE SAID
47xc021c EVEN CAUTIOUS MANAGERS SUCH AS MR. SUCKOW ARE SEEING THE IMPACT OF THE CAMPEAU DEBACLE
47xc021d HE SAYS HIS FIRM OWNS A SMALL AMOUNT OF THE FEDERATED SENIOR DEBT
47xc021e ALTHOUGH THE BONDS ARE SECURED BY BANK CREDITS THEY HAVE ALSO FALLEN IN PRICE RECENTLY
47xc0301 THE P- COMPUTER ALSO CAN DISPLAY A PATTERN SHOWING HOW PEOPLE NORMALLY PLACE THE TONGUE TO PRODUCE SAY AN S. SOUND
47xc0302 A DEAF PERSON CAN THEN TRY TO MATCH THE PATTERN BY PLACING THE TONGUE AGAINST THE ELECTRONIC PALATE
47xc0303 WITH CAREFUL COACHING AND TRIAL AND ERROR CHILDREN LIKE MISS GILROY CAN LEARN HOW TO MAKE SOUNDS THAT REQUIRE PLACING THE TONGUE AGAINST THE ROOF OF THE MOUTH
47xc0304 THE TRASH
47xc0305 PROOFS OF PURCHASE AND SALES RECEIPTS THAT HAD BEEN TURNED IN FOR CONSUMER PRODUCT REBATES AND ALREADY PAID

47xc030d PEOPLE TOOK POSITIONS IN THE STOCK SIMPLY ON THE RUMOR OF A TAKEOVER BY SOMEONE NO ONE HAD EVER HEARD OF
47xc030e SOME OF THE FULL TIME RISK TAKERS DON'T EVEN NEED PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS TO PLUNGE
47xc030f NOR DO THEY REQUIRE INSIDE INFORMATION A LA IVAN BOESKY WHO WAS VENAL BUT NOT INSANE
47xc030g THE PEOPLE WHO INVESTED IN DAYTON HUDSON HOWEVER WERE MAD
47xc030h SOMEBODY DANGLED A FANTASY IN FRONT OF THESE SUPPOSEDLY SAVVY GUYS AND THEY WENT FOR IT LIKE TROUT TO THE FLY
47xc030i SELLING THE CANADIAN BUSINESS WILL HELP T. L. C. GROUP COMPLETE ITS FINANCING ON THE REST OF BEATRICE INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS
47xc030j T. L. C. GROUP SAID YESTERDAY THAT IT HAS A FIRM COMMITMENT FROM DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT INC. ITS INVESTMENT BANKER TO FINANCE ITS ACQUISITION
47xc030k <NOISE> A DREXEL SPOKESMAN SAID HE EXPECTS THE FINANCING TO COME THROUGH A COMBINATION OF BANK LOANS AND HIGH YIELD BONDS
47xc030l DREXEL FINANCED THE KOHLBERG KRAVIS BUY OUT OF BEATRICE LAST YEAR
47xc030m MR. LAY SAID THE LOSSES OCCURED IN LATE SEPTEMBER AND EARLY THIS MONTH A TIME OF PARTICULAR VOLATILITY IN OIL MARKETS
47xc030n THERE WERE TWO SENIOR PEOPLE COLLUDING AND KEEPING A SEPARATE SET OF BOOKS APART FROM THE OFFICIAL BOOKS FOR A FEW WEEKS MR. LAY SAID
47xc030o THEIR GUESSES WERE WRONG ON BOTH SIDES OF THE MARKET
47xc030p IN A STATEMENT TIMEPLEX SAID ITS DIRECTORS VOTED TO POSTPONE THE ANNUAL MEETING WHICH WAS SCHEDULED FOR YESTERDAY
47xc030q A NEW DATE HASN'T BEEN SET
47xc030r <NOISE> A UNISYS SPOKESMAN SAID THE COMPANIES HOPE TO COMPLETE THE ACQUISITION WHICH REQUIRES TIMEPLEX HOLDERS' APPROVAL AND GOVERNMENT CLEARANCE IN ABOUT FOUR MONTHS
47xc030s AT THE MEETING SHAREHOLDERS APPROVED AN INCREASE IN AUTHORIZED COMMON SHARES TO TWENTY MILLION FROM FIFTEEN MILLION
47xc030t THE ADDITIONAL SHARES MAY BE USED FOR BENEFIT PLANS TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING OR TO MAKE ACQUISITIONS
47xc030u THE COMPANY HAS ABOUT TEN POINT EIGHT MILLION COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING
47xc030v THE U. S. OF COURSE HAS A VAST AND IN MANY PLACES EFFICIENT INFRASTRUCTURE
47xc030w THE COUNCIL STUDY PUT A VALUE OF ONE TRILLION ON THE PARTS IT MEASURED
47xc030x BUT GOVERNMENT OWNED FIXED CAPITAL S:UFFERS ALONG WITH PRIVATELY OWNED PLANT AND EQUIPMENT WHEN ECONOMIC POLICIES DISCOURAGE LONG TERM INVESTMENT
47xc030y THE GREATEST SCOURGE OF THE INVESTMENT IS OF COURSE INFLATION WHICH EXPLAINS WHY THE NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE SUFFER PARTICULARLY DURING THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES
47xc030z <NOISE> USER FEES SIMPLY COULD NOT KEEP UP WITH THE SOARING COSTS OF LOANS AND CONSTRUCTION
47xc0310 HIGHWAY CONSTRUCTION HAD THE ADDED PROBLEM OF REDUCED YIELDS FROM GASOLINE TAXES BROUGHT ABOUT BY ENERGY SHORTAGES AND SHORTAGE ENFORCED CONSERVATION
47xc0311 <NOISE> THE MEASURE WAS A BOLD MOVE FOR A PRESIDENT WHO HAS COME TO VIEW INERTIA AS THE BEST FORM OF SECURITY
47xc0312 THE SUSPENSION EFFECTIVELY WILL SLASH SALARIES AND CUT AN ESTIMATED EIGHT POINT THREE BILLION FROM FEDERAL SPENDING THIS YEAR
47xc0313 THE AIM IS TO HOLD THE BUDGET DEFICIT TO FOUR POINT NINE PERCENT OF ECONOMIC OUTPUT DOWN FROM A PROJECTED SEVEN PERCENT
47xc0314 <NOISE> THIS IT IS HOPED WILL HELP STOP INF(LATION)- HIGH INFLATION FROM SPIRALING INTO HYPERINFLATION
47xc0315 THE THINK TANK MEASURED EXPENSE RATIOS WHICH ARE A FUND'S OPERATING COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF ASSETS
47xc0316 FOR INVESTORS HIGH RATIOS ARE CLEARLY OF CONCERN
47xc0317 IT CUTS INTO POTENTIAL RETURN EVEN WHEN A FUND IS DOING WELL
47xc0318 <NOISE> AND IT LEAVES A FUND WITH LESS OF A CUSHION IN CASE PERFORMANCE SOURS
47xc0319 ALMOST UNNOTICED IN DISCUSSIONS OF THE PROCUREMENT SCANDAL IS THE FACT THAT THIS ELABORATE INDEED TORTUOUS SYSTEM SEEMS TO HAVE WORKED AT LEAST ON ITS OWN TERMS
47xc031a NOBODY WAS ABLE TO THROW A CONTRACT DIRECTLY
47xc031b INSTEAD WHAT SOME CONTRACTORS SEEM TO HAVE DONE IS TO BUY INSIDE INFORMATION THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO PREPARE A BETTER PROPOSAL
47xc031c <NOISE> NINE MONTH RESULTS ALSO INCLUDE A TWELVE MILLION NET LOSS FROM THE DISPOSITION OF TRUCKING OPERATIONS
47xc031d ABOUT EIGHT MILLION OF THE TRUCKING CHARGE WAS TAKEN IN THE THIRD QUARTER
47xc031e YEAR EARLIER RESULTS WERE RESTATED FOR ACCOUNTING CHANGES
47xc031f N. E. C. CORP. AS ONE EXAMPLE BEGAN DONATING MONEY TO M. I. T. IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES

47xc031h C. AND C. IS THE N. E. C. CORPORATE SLOGAN IT STANDS FOR COMPUTERS AND COMMUNICATIONS
47xc0401 <NOISE> THE BIG PROBLEM IS THAT DOCTOR THANOS CAN NO LONGER USE SO CALLED PASSIVE LOSSES FROM THESE PROPERTIES TO OFFSET HIS SALARY OR EARNED INCOME
47xc0402 <NOISE> THE DISALLOWANCE OF PASSIVE LOSSES IS BEING PHASED IN OVER FIVE YEARS
47xc0403 REAL ESTATE DEPRECIATION SCHEDULES ALSO HAVE BEEN LENGTHENED REDUCING THEIR VALUE
47xc0404 WHILE THE U. S. FOCUSES ON THE IRAN CONTRA HEARINGS MORE SOVIET ARMS FLOW INTO NICARAGUA
47xc0405 MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF WEAPONS WERE DELIVERED TO THE SANDINISTAS IN THE FIRST HALF OF THIS YEAR ACCORDING TO U. S. INTELLIGENCE
47xc0406 THAT'S ABOUT NINE TIMES THE DIRECT U. S. MILITARY AID PROVIDED TO THE CONTRAS IN THAT PERIOD
47xc0407 THE SOVIET EQUIPMENT IS JUST POURING IN ONE RANKING PENTAGON OFFICIAL TOLD THE A. P.
47xc0408 THE NICARAGUANS ARE CONSOLIDATING THEIR MILITARY BUILDING AND ADDING TO IT EVERYTHING IMAGINABLE

47xc040a AFTER HIGH PRICES AND FRANTIC BIDDING AT ART AUCTIONS LAST SPRING ABOUT ONE IN FOUR WORKS DIDN'T SELL AT A CONTEMPORARY ART AUCTION AT CHRISTIE'S
47xc040b BUT AT LEAST THE MARKET DIDN'T CRASH
47xc040c CITICORP'S LOSS FOR THE YEAR STEMMED FROM A THREE BILLION DOLLAR ADDITION IN THE SECOND QUARTER TO LOSS RESERVES FOR LOANS TO DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
47xc040d <NOISE> EXCLUDING ONE TIME GAINS AND LOSSES CITICORP'S NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN PROFIT WOULD HAVE BEEN ONE POINT ONE FIVE BILLION DOLLARS
47xc040e EXCLUDED ARE GAINS ON REAL ESTATE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER AND PENSION ASSETS IN THE THIRD QUARTER PLUS THE EFFECT OF THE RESERVE ADDITION

47xc040h THE STRANGEST INQUIRY LOBBED AT BILL WAS WHAT ROLE I SAW AT FORD FOR MY DAUGHTERS WHO ARE TWO YEARS OLD AND TWO MONTHS OLD
47xc040i I THOUGHT THAT WAS KIND OF PUTTING THE CART BEFORE THE HORSE I WANTED TO GET THEM OUT OF KINDERGARTEN FIRST
47xc040j AND WHAT IF THE FOUNDRY CAN'T KEEP UP WITH CUMMINS'S DEMAND
47xc040k MR. PATTERSON SAYS THE ENGINE COMPANY HAS BACKUP SUPPLIERS
47xc040l BUT HE ADDS THAT BACKUP IS ALL OFFSHORE
47xc040m <NOISE> PEOPLE ARE SCARED SAYS RICHARD ROSS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF INVESTOR BEHAVIOR A RESEARCH ORGANIZATION IN CHICAGO
47xc040n WHEN THE MARKET GOES DOWN STOP ORDERS APPEAR LIKE CRAZY HE SAYS

47xc0410 BUT FRED MCINTYRE A RAILROAD WORKER IN OMAHA NEBRASKA VOWS THAT HE WILL NEVER INVEST IN THE MARKET AGAIN FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE
47xc0411 WITH GOOD REASON
47xc0412 AS BLACK MONDAY DAWNED HE HELD IN HIS BROKERAGE ACCOUNT A HANDSOME NEST EGG OF MORE THAN FOUR TIMES HIS THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLAR A YEAR PAY
47xc0413 THE NEXT DAY ALL OF IT WAS GONE AND HE OWED HIS BROKER MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TO BOOT
47xc0414 DAVID MEISTER F. N. N.'S PRESIDENT ACKNOWLEDGED THE COMPANY HAS BEEN IN DISCUSSIONS WITH OTHER MEDIA CONCERNS BUT HE DECLINED TO IDENTIFY THEM
47xc0415 WE'VE SPOKEN TO VIRTUALLY EVERY COMPANY YOU CAN IMAGINE PLUS A HALF DOZEN MORE YOU WOULDN'T THINK OF MR. MEISTER SAID
47xc0416 HE DENIED INDUSTRY SPECULATION THAT F. N. N. IS LOOKING TO SELL THE COMPANY
47xc0417 WE'RE NOT INTERESTED IN SELLING AND WE'RE NOT SOLICITING ANYTHING HE SAID
47xc0418 <NOISE> HOWEVER HE ADDED THAT'S NOT TO SAY WE WOULDN'T ENTERTAIN ANY REASONABLE OFFER FOR AT LEAST A PIECE OF F. N. N.
47xc0419 IN A RELATED MATTER A REVIEW COMMISSION ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE ON OCTOBER EIGHTEENTH THREW OUT OSHA CITATIONS AGAINST MORRELL
47xc041a THE CITATIONS ISSUED IN APRIL NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN CHARGED RECORD KEEPING VIOLATIONS
47xc041b THE OFFICIAL DISALLOWED OSHA'S INSTANCE BY INSTANCE CITATION WHICH PROPOSED A TOTAL FINE OF SIX HUNDRED AND NINETY THOUSAND DOLLARS
47xc041c <NOISE> THE OFF:ICIAL ALSO SAID OSHA DIDN'T ISSUE THE CITATION WITHIN THE SIX MONTHS SPECIFIED BY LAW FROM THE TIME AN OFFICIAL INSPECTION BEGINS
47yc0201 TO CURB DOMESTIC CONSUMPTION AND SALVAGE THE TRADE SURPLUS BRAZIL'S ECONOMIC PLANNERS RECENTLY IMPOSED A TOUGH PACKAGE OF TAX AND PRICE INCREASES
47yc0202 THE RESULT BRAZILIANS LAST WEEK RIOTED IN THE STREETS OF BRASILIA IN THE WORST VIOLENCE IN THE COUNTRY'S CAPITAL IN ITS TWENTY SIX YEAR HISTORY
47yc0203 AND A GENERAL STRIKE HAS BEEN TENTATIVELY SET FOR DECEMBER TWELFTH
47yc0204 RATES ARE DETERMINED BY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PURCHASE PRICE AND FACE VALUE
47yc0205 THUS HIGHER BIDDING NARROWS THE INVESTOR'S RETURN WHILE LOWER BIDDING WIDENS IT
47yc0206 THE PERCENTAGE RATES ARE CALCULATED ON A THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY DAY YEAR WHILE THE COUPON EQUIVALENT YIELD IS BASED ON A THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE DAY YEAR
47yc0207 THE LASTEST DISCLOSURES ARE AN OUTGROWTH OF THAT PROBE
47yc0208 ALREADY THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION HAS ACCUSED DELTA AIRLINES AND EASTERN AIRLINES OF ENGAGING IN UNREALISTIC SCHEDULING AT ATLANTA'S HARTSFIELD AIRPORT
47yc0209 THE CARRIERS DENY THIS BUT THE GOVERNMENT HAS EXPANDED ITS PROBE
47yc020a IT HAS ASKED SEVERAL OTHER AIRLINES TO TURN OVER THEIR ON TIME RECORDS AT DALLAS FORT WORTH CHICAGO'S O'HARE AND BOSTON'S LOGAN AIRPORTS
47yc020b IT WAS A WONDERFUL DAY FOR THE BOND MARKETS SAID MICHAEL J. CONNERY A SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF FINANCIAL FUTURES AT CHICAGO BASED REFCO INCORPORATED
47yc020c ALL THE APPARENT SIGNS OF INFLATION WERE DEFLATED
47yc020d AND THAT'S LED TO A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF SHORT COVERING OR TRADERS AND INVESTORS BUYING BACK SECURITIES THAT THEY HAD BORROWED AND SOLD
47yc020e STILL WHATEVER THE RISK OF GARBAGE BURNING THE ALTERNATIVE LANDFILL IS WORSE SAYS MR. MCMANUS THE PUBLISHER OF RESOURCE RECOVERY REPORT
47yc020f INDEED MANY OLDER LANDFILLS WEREN'T PROPERLY CONSTRUCTED TO CONTAIN THE TOXIC SUBSTANCES NOW LEACHING FROM DECAYING TRASH
47yc020g IN MANY STATES WATER AND AIR QUALITY IS THREATENED
47yc020h <NOISE> NEW YORK CITY'S FRESH KILLS LANDFILL ON STATEN ISLAND FOR ONE DUMPS FOUR MILLION GALLONS OF TOXIC LIQUID INTO NEARBY FRESHWATER STREAMS EVERY DAY
47yc020i EVEN THE TRADITIONAL GREEN STAMP MIGHT BECOME A THING OF THE PAST
47yc020j IN RESPONSE TO CONSUMERS' COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE TASK OF PASTING IN TRADING STAMPS SPERRY AND HUTCHINSON COMPANY IS TESTING ELECTRONIC GREEN STAMPS IN SUPERMARKETS IN CONNECTICUT
47yc020k INSTEAD OF RECEIVING PAPER STAMPS CONSUMERS HAND O- CASHIER A PLASTIC CARD
47yc020l THE CARD IS INSERTED INTO A TERMINAL THAT AUTOMATICALLY RECORDS THE NUMBER OF STAMPS ACCRUED
47yc020m RORER GROUP WHOSE STOCK EASED THREE EIGHTHS TO THIRTY FIVE AND THREE QUARTERS SAID IT SIGNED A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE A. H. ROBINS
47yc020n THE AGREEMENT IS A KEY PART OF ROBINS'S BANKRUPTCY REORGANIZATION PLAN
47yc020o ROBINS JUMPED ONE AND A HALF TO TWENTY ONE
47yc020p BUT WHILE NICKEL AND ESPECIALLY COPPER QUOTES HAVE SINCE REBOUNDED ALUMINUM PRICES HAVE CONTINUED TO TUMBLE
47yc020q IT SEEMS TO BE IN PEOPLE'S INTEREST TO KEEP THE PRICE DOWN RIGHT NOW SAYS ONE LONDON EXCHANGE TRADER
47yc020r THIS WILL ULTIMATELY GIVE THEM MORE BUYING OPPORTUNITIES DOWN THE LINE
47yc020s SOURCES SAID AN ANNOUNCEMENT WILL BE MADE THIS MORNING IN TORONTO FOLLOWED BY A NEWS CONFERENCE
47yc020t BURNS FRY'S ABOUT SEVENTY MEMBER BOARD YESTERDAY WAS PRESENTED WITH THE PROPOSAL BY ITS ELEVEN MEMBER EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE WHICH ALREADY HAS APPROVED THE TRANSACTION
47yc020u SECURITY PACIFIC'S BOARD APPROVED THE TRANSACTION AT A MEETING A FEW DAYS AGO THE SOURCES SAID
47yc020v THE EXPECTED FOURTH QUARTER RESULT WOULD GIVE THE COMPANY PROFIT OF TEN TO TWELVE CENTS A SHARE FOR ALL OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
47yc020w IT POSTED PROFIT OF TWENTY SEVEN CENTS A SHARE FOR NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX INCLUDING ABOUT FOURTEEN CENTS A SHARE FROM AN ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENT
47yc020x THE COMPANY DIDN'T MAKE ESTIMATES FOR NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN NET INCOME
47yc020y AT SCHWAB THE NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT CAPITAL BUDGET IS ABOUT TWENTY PERCENT LESS THAN THE AMOUNT BEING SPENT THIS YEAR ACCORDING TO LAWRENCE STUPSKI SCHWAB'S PRESIDENT
47yc020z BEFORE THE CRASH SCHWAB EXPECTED TO OPEN THIRTY NEW OFFICES IN THE NEXT TWO YEARS
47yc0210 BUT MR. STUPSKI SAID THAT NUMBER HAD BEEN CUT ABOUT FIFTY PERCENT BECAUSE OF THE OUTLOOK FOR LOWER VOLUMES
47yc0211 OFF THE HOOK THE RESIGNATION OF JUSTICE DEPARTMENT CRIMINAL DIVISION CHIEF WELD ERASES RHODE ISLAND REPUBLICAN'S SAINT GERMAIN'S RISK OF INDICTMENT FOR TAKING MEALS FROM LOBBYISTS
47yc0212 AGENCY LAWYERS WHO RAN A GRAND JURY INVESTIGATION URGED NO ACTION CITING HOUSE RULES ALLOWING NEARLY UNLIMITED ENTERTAINMENT
47yc0213 WELD WAS RELUCTANT TO DROP THE CASE
47yc0214 ROBERT RAVITZ A GREY SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT SAYS THE AGENCY DID THE BEST IT COULD BASED ON DRAWINGS OF THE COIN
47yc0215 RESPONDING TO MISS JONES'S COMMENTS HE SAYS I DON'T KNOW WHAT HER PROBLEM IS WITH THE ARTWORK
47yc0216 IT WAS AN INCREDIBLE TIME CRUNCH
47yc0217 IF WE HAD LONGER TIME I'M SURE WE COULD HAVE MASSAGED THE ARTWORK TO DEATH
47yc0218 SO FAR THE ADMINISTRATION HAS IGNORED THESE APPEALS AND SO HAVE MR. REED AND OTHER BANKERS
47yc0219 IT SEEMS THAT THE PRINCIPLES ENUNCIATED AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS DECADE BY MESSRS.
47yc021a WRISTON AND THEOBALD STILL PREVAIL IF NOT IN LENDING THE BANK'S MONEY AT LEAST IN SUGGESTING THAT OTHER INVESTORS PUT UP THE CASH
47yc021b BUT EXPERIENCE SHOWS THAT ONCE AN UPSCALE PRODUCT PUTS ITS NAME ON LOWER PRICED GOODS IT CAN NEVER GO BACK UP
47yc021c REVLON GROUP INCORPORATED FOR EXAMPLE IS MAKING A LONG SHOT ATTEMPT TO REKINDLE THE HALSTON FLAME
47yc021d REVLON OWNER OF HALSTON ENTERPRISES INCORPORATED HAS VISIONS OF SEEING HALSTON LABEL CLOTHES BACK IN BETTER DRESS DEPARTMENTS
47yc021e BUT MARKETERS BELIEVE THE COMPANY HAS A CREDIBILITY PROBLEM AFTER ITS SIX YEAR ASSOCIATION WITH RETAILER J. C. PENNEY COMPANY WHICH ENDED LAST YEAR
47yc0301 BUT WHEN LEVERAGED BUYOUT COMPANIES SELL STOCK THE BIG WINNERS USUALLY ARE A TIGHT CIRCLE OF EXECUTIVES AND INVESTMENT BANKERS WHO EARLIER BOUGHT CONTROL
47yc0302 PROFITS OFTEN EXCEED TEN TIMES THESE INVESTORS' ORIGINAL STAKE
47yc0303 THESE GIANT CONCENTRATED PAYOFFS FROM LEVERAGED BUYOUTS ARE STARTING TO ANGER MAINSTREAM INVESTORS AND WORRY ACADEMICS
47yc0304 IT'S INCONCEIVABLE THAT THE DIRECTORATE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT MR. RODRIGUEZ COMMENTS ONE INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS WORKER WHO HAS STUDIED THE LOCAL REFUGEE SITUATION
47yc0305 THE PEOPLE OF EL BARILLO ARE UNDER THE BOOT
47yc0306 THEY'VE BEEN SMART ENOUGH TO SURVIVE
47yc0307 THEY'VE ADAPTED
47yc0308 THE NEW TAX LAW'S LIMITS ON RETIREMENT BENEFITS FOR EXECUTIVES SPUR GREATER INTEREST IN CERTAIN TRUSTS THAT HELP SAFEGUARD DEFERRED COMPENSATION UNTIL T- RETIREMENT TIME
47yc0309 SUCH TRUSTS AREN'T COMPLETELY INVIOLATE CREDITORS CAN CLAIM THE MONEY AFTER A BANKRUPTCY FOR INSTANCE
47yc030a BUT THEY ARE CONSIDERED BETTER THAN A MERE PROMISE TO THE EXECUTIVE
47yc030b THE DRUG AZIDOTHYMIDINE OR A. Z. T. IS THE FIRST PRESCRIPTION DRUG FOR ACQUIRED IMMUNE DEFICIENCY SYNDROME TO GET FEDERAL FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION APPROVAL
47yc030c A. Z. T. IS MARKETED UNDER THE NAME RETROVIR BY BURROUGHS WELLCOME COMPANY AT AN ANNUAL RETAIL DOSAGE COST OF ABOUT TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS
47yc030d IT ALSO IS THE MOST EXPENSIVE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PROMPTING FEARS THAT SOME INSURERS WHO NORMALLY PROVIDE PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE WILL BALK AT ITS PRICE
47yc030e NOW THE ISSUE IS IN THE HOUSE'S LAP
47yc030f THE TEMPORARY BAN ON NEW BANKING POWERS IS A PROVISION IN THE SENATE VERSION OF A BILL TO RECAPITALIZE THE INSOLVENT FEDERAL SAVINGS AND LOAN INSURANCE CORP.
47yc030g THE HOUSE F. S. L. I. C. MEASURE DOESN'T HAVE ANY OTHER PROVISIONS
47yc030h IN ADDITION BY CONSENTING TO RORER'S BID ROBINS MAY HAVE PUT ITSELF UP FOR SALE
47yc030i THE WHOLE THING COULD STILL DETERIORATE INTO AN AUCTION SAID A LAWYER WHO WAS INVOLVED IN THE MANVILLE CORPORATION BANKRUPTCY LAW CASE
47yc030j OTHER BIDDERS COULD COME IN
47yc030k CALIFORNIANS WERE ASKED HOW THE STATE SHOULD GET RID OF ITS HEFTY BUDGET SURPLUS NOW ESTIMATED AT ONE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS
47yc030l BY A TWO TO ONE MARGIN REGISTERED DEMOCRATS SURVEYED BY THE FIELD INSTITUTE FAVORED GIVING THE MONEY TO PUBLIC SCHOOLS
47yc030m BUT THE STATE CONSTITUTION MAY REQUIRE THE MONEY TO BE RETURNED DIRECTLY TO TAXPAYERS
47yc030n THAT APPEARS MORE IN LINE WITH REPUBLICAN THINKING
47yc030o REPUBLICANS ASKED HOW TO DISBURSE THE SURPLUS SPLIT FIFTY FIFTY BETWEEN SCHOOLS AND PERSONAL TAX REBATES
47yc030p HARRY TRUMAN WHISTLE STOPPED THE COUNTRY IN NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT CAMPAIGNING AGAINST A PAROCHIAL DO NOTHING CONGRESS THAT WOULD NOT ENACT HIS LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM
47yc030q HE STRUCK A CHORD IN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NOT ONLY WINNING A STUNNING UPSET BUT ALSO DEFEATING SCORES OF REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMEN IN THE PROCESS
47yc030r TRUMAN RECOGNIZED THAT A PRESIDENTIAL CONTEST IS NOT JUST A RACE AMONG CANDIDATES BUT ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY TO DEBATE GREAT ISSUES SUCH AS THE PROPER SEPARATION OF POWERS
47yc030s THE CONTEST THEN ISN'T IDEOLOGICAL
47yc030t IT'S CHARACTER PERSONALITY EXPERIENCE
47yc030u IT'S CULTURAL AS MUCH AS ANYTHING ELSE
47yc030v PRESIDENT REAGAN WHO WAS IN DURHAM NORTH CAROLINA WAS CAUTIOUS ABOUT THE SOVIET OFFER
47yc030w I'M WAITING TO SEE WHAT THE CONDITIONS ARE HE SAID
47yc030x A SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL HOWEVER CALLED THE GORBACHEV STATEMENT A WATERSHED EVENT BECAUSE IT WILL INCREASE EXPECTATIONS AMONG SOVIET PEOPLE FOR WITHDRAWAL
47yc030y COMPLETION OF THE TRANSACTION WHICH ALSO REQUIRES APPROVAL BY REGULATORY AGENCIES AND HOLDERS OF OTHER SECURITIES MUST BE COMPLETED NO LATER THAN NOVEMBER THIRTIETH UNDER THE AGREEMENT
47yc030z IF IT DOESN'T CLOSE AS EXPECTED BY SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH THE CASH PRICE PAID BY NOVA FOR EACH POLYSAR COMMON SHARE WOULD RISE TEN CANADIAN CENTS
47yc0310 THE CASH PRICE WOULD RISE FIFTEEN MORE CENTS TO FOURTEEN DOLLARS AND SEVENTY FIVE CENTS CANADIAN A SHARE IF THE TRANSACTION CLOSES IN NOVEMBER THE SIDES SAID
47yc0311 TRANSAMERICA SAID ITS CONSUMER LENDING BUSINESS ACHIEVED RECORD RESULTS IN THE QUARTER WITH CONSUMER LOANS SECURED BY REAL ESTATE GROWING TO TWO POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS
47yc0312 ITS LEASING BUSINESS ALSO POSTED RECORD RESULTS
47yc0313 DEMAND FOR STANDARD CONTAINERS WAS HIGH BECAUSE OF STRONG WORLD TRADE TRANSAMERICA SAID
47yc0314 HOWEVER THE SAN FRANCISCO BASED COMPANY SAID ITS REAL ESTATE OPERATIONS REPORTED LOWER EARNINGS
47yc0315 THAT LEAVES THE OPTION OF A MILITARY STRIKE AT TERRORISTS OR THEIR BASES WHICH ARE MAINLY IN LEBANON'S BEKAA VALLEY AN AREA UNDER SYRIAN CONTROL
47yc0316 U. S. INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES HAVE IDENTIFIED AS POTENTIAL TARGETS THERE BUILDINGS KNOWN TO HAVE BEEN USED BY HEZBOLLAH FORCES AND THEIR MENTORS THE IRANIAN REVOLUTIONARY GUARDS
47yc0317 BUT THEY AREN'T CERTAIN WHICH FACTIONS USE WHICH BUILDINGS OR WHEN THEY ARE PRESENT
47yc0318 QUITE POSSIBLY A RECENT PROFIT SHARING BONUS HELPED
47yc0319 WE DON'T HAVE AN ELEGANT FORMULA SAYS MR. BARRON
47yc031a WE SAID WE THINK EVERYONE'S ENTITLED TO A SHARE SO HERE'S A CHECK
47yc031b NEXT YEAR IF WE DO WELL THERE MAY BE A BIGGER CHECK
47yc031c IS THIS ANY WAY TO RUN A RAILROAD
47yc031d COULD BE
47yc031e CONSUMERS MAY ALSO BE WORRIED ABOUT WHETHER AUTO MAKERS WILL CONTINUE THE GENEROUS INCENTIVES THEY'VE USED ALMOST CONTINUOUSLY OVER THE PAST YEAR TO BUOY SALES
47yc031f <NOISE> WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IS THE GOOD OLD BUY IN ADVANCE SYNDROME SAID JOHN QUALLS OF MICRO ECONOMICS LIMITED IN SAINT LOUIS
47yc031g MR. QUALLS EXPECTS SALES TO SAG BADLY IN THE FOURTH QUARTER CAUSING SUPPLIES OF UNSOLD VEHICLES TO RISE UNLESS AUTO MAKERS SHOW CONTINUED RESTRAINT IN PRODUCTION
47yc0401 THE IRANIAN CRISIS AND THE ADMINISTRATION'S UNCERTAIN GRIP ON IT HAS REAWAKENED THIS CYNICISM
47yc0402 THE POLLS SHOW MUCH OF THE PUBLIC DOES NOT BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT WHEN HE DENIES KNOWING THAT PROFITS FROM IRANIAN ARMS SALES HAD BEEN USED TO AID THE CONTRAS
47yc0403 ON THIS THE MATTER IS LIKELY TO TURN
47yc0404 NOT ON WHETHER THE SHIPMENTS WERE A GOOD *IDEA* OR ON WHETHER LAWYERS CAN FIND SOME LAW THAT HAS BEEN BROKEN
47yc0405 BUT ON WHETHER PRESIDENT REAGAN TOLD THE TRUTH WHEN HE DENIED KNOWING
47yc0406 INTERCO SAID THAT BECAUSE OF THE DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT ITS INTERCO SUBSIDIARY INCORPORATED UNIT TERMINATED ITS TENDER OFFER FOR ALL LANE COMMON SHARES AT FIFTY FIVE DOLLARS A SHARE
47yc0407 THE OFFER WAS SET TO EXPIRE MONDAY
47yc0408 ANY SHARES TENDERED TO INTERCO UNDER THE OFFER WILL BE RETURNED TO LANE SHAREHOLDERS INTERCO SAID
47yc0409 NEVERTHELESS FIRST OPTIONS STILL LETS CUSTOMERS SUCH AS JAMES F. HART TRADE IN NAKED OUT OF THE MONEY PUTS AND CALLS
47yc040a MR. HART SAYS FIRST OPTIONS HASN'T SOUGHT TO REIN HIM IN
47yc040b OTHER BROKERAGE FIRMS HOWEVER HAVE CURBED OR HALTED UNHEDGED OPTIONS TRADING SINCE THE CRASH
47yc040c PET OWNERS OFTEN CALL A PET PSYCHIC BECAUSE A PET IS SICK AND THEY WANT A DETAILED ACCOUNT OF HOW IT'S FEELING
47yc040d AND SOME PET PSYCHICS CLAIM THEY CAN CHAT WITH PETS FROM A DISTANCE
47yc040e FOR EXAMPLE GAY TRAVERS A FORMER PUBLICIST CALLED PET PSYCHIC PENELOPE SMITH WHEN HER CAT SEBASTIAN WAS VERY ILL
47yc040f MS. SMITH TOLD HER TO HANG UP WHILE THE PSYCHIC TALKED TO SEBASTIAN
47yc040g THREE MINUTES LATER SHE CALLED BACK WITH SOME BAD NEWS
47yc040h DOES THAT MEAN A CABINET POST
47yc040i YEAH SAID MR. IACOCCA
47yc040j MAYBE
47yc040k MORE LIKELY THOUGH MR. IACOCCA WOULD PREFER TO BE PART OF AN INFORMAL GROUP OF PRESIDENTIAL ADVISERS
47yc040l EARLIER THIS YEAR THE SIXTY THREE YEAR OLD EXECUTIVE SIGNED A NEW FOUR YEAR CONTRACT WITH CHRYSLER
47yc040m AND IN TUESDAY'S INTERVIEW MR. IACOCCA MAINTAINED THAT HE WANTS TO LEAD THE COMPANY INTO THE NINETEEN NINETIES
47yc040n NEITHER THE VOLUNTEER DOCTORS NOR THE SCIENTISTS CONDUCTING THE EXPERIMENT KNEW WHICH VOLUNTEERS WERE TAKING ACTIVE ASPIRIN AND WHICH WERE TAKING PLACEBOS
47yc040o HOWEVER A SEPARATE COMMITTEE WAS SET UP TO MONITOR THE RESULTS OF THE EXPERIMENT AS IT PROCEEDED
47yc040p IT WAS THIS COMMITTEE THAT IN DECEMBER DECIDED THAT THE BENEFITS OF THE ASPIRIN IN REDUCING HEART ATTACKS WERE SO CLEAR THERE WASN'T ANY NEED TO CONTINUE THE EXPERIMENT
47yc040q IT'S A WELCOME DEVELOPMENT IN THE FACE OF VERY SIGNIFICANT INVENTORY OVERHANG SAYS MORGAN STANLEY'S MR. ROACH
47yc040r A SLOWING OF GROWTH IN PRODUCTION GIVES COMPANIES THE ABILITY TO WORK OFF SOME INVENTORY
47yc040s <NOISE> AND ECONOMISTS NOTE THAT THE STEADY OPERATING RATE INDICATES CONTINUED STRENGTH IN THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR
47yc040t THE FOLLOWING DAY MR. LI MARCHED TO CITY HALL HIS AGING PASTRIES IN HAND AND DUMPED THEM ON THE DESK OF THE SURPRISED MAYOR
47yc040u THE MARKETS ARE FULL OF POOR QUALITY PASTRIES MR. LI PROCLAIMED
47yc040v WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT
47yc040w IN MY ORIGINAL SQUAD I'M THE ONLY ONE LEFT UNHARMED
47yc040x IN MY PLATOON THERE'S ONLY THIRTEEN OF US
47yc040y IT SEEMS EVERYDAY ANOTHER YOUNG GUY EIGHTEEN TO NINETEEN YEARS OLD LIKE MYSELF IS KILLED IN ACTION
47yc040z AS FOR PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS WALL STREET'S EUPHEMISM FOR HA- TRIGGER HAPPY TRADING IT'S A BIT HARDER TO GAUGE THE RISKS
47yc0410 THE FIRM IS A BIG GOVERNMENT BOND TRADER AND HAS GROWN A LOT IN FOREIGN CURRENCY TRADING
47yc0411 AND AMONG MORGAN STANLEY'S BIGGEST PERCENTAGE GAINS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN WAS EQUITY PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS WHICH NEARLY TRIPLED TO TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS IN REVENUE
47yc0412 IT'S PRETTY REASONABLE FOR PEOPLE TO TAKE A DIVE ON THIS ONE HE SAYS
47yc0413 I'M A LITTLE SCARED
47yc0414 I DON'T BLAME PEOPLE FOR NOT BEING HEROES
47yc0415 JONES INTERCABLE ALSO BOUGHT SEVERAL SYSTEMS SERVING TWELVE THOUSAND SUBSCRIBERS IN THE SOUTHWESTERN MICHIGAN AREA
47yc0416 IT MADE THE ACQUISITION ON BEHALF OF JONES CABLE INCOME FUND ONE B. C. VENTURE <NOISE> A JOINT VENTURE OF TWO INTERCABLE MANAGED LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS
47yc0417 THE PURCHASE WAS FROM OMEGA AFFILIATES
47yc0418 DANIEL J. GILMARTIN WAS NAMED PRESIDENT AND CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER OF FRANK'S NURSERY AND CRAFTS DETROIT A UNIT OF THIS SPECIALTY RETAILER
47yc0419 THE POST HAD BEEN VACANT SINCE N- EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
47yc041a MR. GILMARTIN HAD BEEN DIRECTOR CORPORATE PLANNING FOR THE PARENT COMPANY
47yc041b ECONOMISTS SEEK NEW METAPHORS TO REPLACE SOFT LANDING
47yc041c STEPHEN ROACH OF MORGAN STANLEY SAYS THE WHEELS HAVEN'T HIT THE RUNWAY
47yc041d KEMPER FINANCIAL SERVICES' DAVID HALE REFERS TO A SOFT TAKEOFF
47yc041e THE LATEST DATA FUEL FED WORRIES ABOUT REIGNITING INFLATION
47zc0201 THE DELAY IS A VICTORY ALBEIT TEMPORARY FOR MR. TRUMP WHO OWNS TWO ATLANTIC CITY CASINO HOTELS
47zc0202 BALLY'S AGREEMENT TO BUY THE GOLDEN NUGGET IS WIDELY PERCEIVED AS AN EFFORT TO SCUTTLE A TAKEOVER ATTEMPT BY MR. TRUMP
47zc0203 MR. TRUMP'S DEMAND THAT THE GOLDEN NUGGET PURCHASE BE BLOCKED CAME AS PART OF A COUNTERSUIT HE FILED AGAINST BALLY IN DECEMBER CHALLENGING A BALLY FINANCIAL RESTRUCTURING PLAN
47zc0204 BALLY HAD EARLIER SUED MR. TRUMP ALLEGING VARIOUS SECURITIES LAW VIOLATIONS
47zc0205 THE OUTLOOK IN THE SENATE IS STILL CLOUDY AS LONG AS PRESIDENT REAGAN CONTINUES TO OPPOSE A TAX BOOST
47zc0206 STILL SENATE BUDGET WRITERS ARE INCLUDING A SIGNIFICANT REVENUE INCREASE IN THEIR DEFICIT REDUCTION PACKAGE
47zc0207 <NOISE> SUCH A BUDGET ITEM WOULD FORCE THE SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE TO COME UP WITH A TAX INCREASE OF SOME KIND
47zc0208 THE HYUNDAI THAT NIFTY AND CHEAP LITTLE KOREAN CAR HAS CAUGHT ON IN THE U. S. AND NO DOUBT COULD COMPETE IN ANY MARKET IN THE WORLD
47zc0209 SO OUR WILLIAM EH- MCGURN INQUIRED INTO HOW MANY HAVE BEEN EXPORTED FROM KOREA TO JAPAN
47zc020a HE FOUND THAT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX THE NUMBER WAS ZERO
47zc020b THIS WAS DOWN FROM NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE WHEN EXPORTS REACHED ONE SOLD TO MITSUBISHI
47zc020c EXPORTS LOST TO TOUGHER COMPETITION ABROAD AND MORE IMPORTS INTO THE U. S. MARKET HAVE CAUSED MANY FARMERS TO ABANDON THEIR TRADITIONAL FAITH IN FREE TRADE
47zc020d FROM SUGAR LONG PROTECTED <NOISE> TO WHEAT TO FLOWERS FARMERS ARE DEMANDING THAT BORDERS BE CLOSED
47zc020e THE LOSERS PARTICULARLY IN SUGAR <NOISE> ARE MANY OF THE LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES WHOSE DESPERATE ECONOMIES THE U. S. GOVERNMENT IS OTHERWISE TRYING TO SALVAGE
47zc020f <NOISE> TOTAL PRIVATE CONSTRUCTION INCREASED ONE POINT SEVEN PERCENT IN AUGUST AFTER A ZERO POINT FOUR PERCENT DROP IN JULY
47zc020g OUTLAYS FOR PUBLIC BUILDING INCREASED ZERO POINT NINE PERCENT AFTER A ONE POINT TWO PERCENT RISE
47zc020h <NOISE> OVERALL AUGUST OUTLAYS WERE ONE POINT ONE PERCENT ABOVE A YEAR EARLIER
47zc020i THE HUGE GAP <NOISE> TO A LARGE EXTENT IS A PRICE PHENOMENON
47zc020j THE DOLLAR'S FALL HAS PUSHED UP THE PRICE OF IMPORTS CAUSING THE DEFICIT TO SWELL EVEN AS THE VOLUME OF NON OIL IMPORTS HAS RECEDED
47zc020k BUT LONG BEFORE NOW THESE HIGHER PRICES W- WERE SUPPOSED TO LEAD TO IMPROVEMENT IN THE MONTHLY MERCHANDISE TRADE DEFICIT AS WELL
47zc020l THE JOURNAL NEVER CAN BE ALL THINGS TO ALL READERS
47zc020m IT DOESN'T TRY TO BE
47zc020n WE ARE NOT PLANNING SPORTS SECTIONS OR LOCAL NEWS COVERAGE COLORED WEATHER MAPS OR STORIES ON EVERY MINOR CRISIS IN THE WORLD
47zc020o WE DO INTEND TO REMAIN AMERICA'S NATIONAL BUSINESS DAILY AND WITH OUR EXPANDING ASIAN AND EUROPEAN EDITIONS THE GLOBAL BUSINESS DAILY AS WELL
47zc020p THAT MEANS FOCUSING FIRMLY ON NEWS THAT BUSY BUSINESS PEOPLE TRULY NEED
47zc020q STILL COMPANY INSIDERS SAID THE RESTRUCTURING WAS ENTIRELY MR. AKERS'S PLAN AND WASN'T FORCED ON HIM BY THE I. B. M. BOARD
47zc020r A DIRECTOR SAID THE BOARD LEARNED OF THE PLAN AT ITS MEETING LAST TUESDAY
47zc020s JOHN FOUND EVERYTHING WAS COMING ONTO HIS DESK AND HE HAD MORE THAN HE COULD E- COPE WITH ANOTHER DIRECTOR SAID
47zc020t HE WANTED AN ORGANIZATION WHICH RESOLVED MORE PROBLEMS BEFORE THEY GOT TO HIM
47zc020u FARM FUTURES PRICES HAVE FALLEN SEVERAL TIMES IN THE PAST TWO WEEKS FOLLOWING SEVERAL WEEKS OF A DROUGHT INSPIRED RALLY
47zc020v YESTERDAY'S TRADING SEEMED TO SUPPORT THE NOTION AMONG SOME ANALYSTS THAT CORN AND WHEAT FUTURES ARE TOP HEAVY
47zc020w THE MARKET HAS BEEN OVERDONE SIGNIFICANTLY ON THE UPSIDE SAID RICHARD LOEWY SENIOR GRAIN AND OIL SEED ANALYST WITH PRUDENTIAL BACHE SECURITIES INCORPORATED
47zc020x THE PIPER HAS TO BE PAID ON THE OTHER SIDE
47zc020y MR. PEROT TOLD TEXAS OFFICIALS LAST MONTH THAT HIS NEW COMPANY WOULD BID AGAINST E. D. S. TO PROCESS ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IN MEDICAID CLAIMS
47zc020z THUS MR. PEROT PUTS INTO PLAY A CONTRACT THAT E. D. S. HAS HELD EXCLUSIVELY SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN
47zc0210 THE CONTRACT EXPIRES NEXT YEAR
47zc0211 THE INDICTMENTS ALLEGE THAT MESSRS.
47zc0212 MARTINO AND ORLOFF APPROVED MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR WORK DONE LARGELY BY HANLEY WORLDWIDE
47zc0213 THEY RECEIVED PAYMENTS IN CASH AND IN THE FORM OF CLOTHES CLUB MEMBERSHIPS AND PAYMENT OF PERSONAL BILLS ACCORDING TO THE CHARGES
47zc0214 N. B. C.'S T. V. COVERAGE ALSO GETS ITS SHARE OF THE BLAME
47zc0215 MARKETERS SAY IT WAS SO BLAND AND SKIPPED SO FREQUENTLY FROM ONE EVENT TO ANOTHER THAT THERE WAS LITTLE CHANCE FOR EXCITEMENT TO BUILD
47zc0216 THE CONSTANT COMMERCIAL INTERRUPTIONS WHICH LED TO RATINGS THAT WERE MUCH LOWER THAN EXPECTED DIDN'T HELP EITHER
47zc0217 THE REHABILITATION PROCESS IS CERTAINLY FURTHER ALONG
47zc0218 THERE'S LESS LOOKING BACK AND MORE LOOKING FORWARD NOW MR. LEFEVRE SAID
47zc0219 PEOPLE ARE FOCUSING MORE ON THE ELECTION AND THE POST ELECTION PERIOD WHAT IT MIGHT MEAN FOR THE ECONOMY
47zc021a ONE OF THE AFFINITY CARDS THAT CHEMICAL BANK DROPPED WAS MARKETED TO ALUMNI OF NEW YORK UNIVERSITY
47zc021b WE WERE SATISFIED WITH THE PROGRAM WHILE IT WAS RUNNING SAYS ROBERT CUNNINGHAM DIRECTOR OF ALUMNI RELATIONS AT N. Y. U.
47zc021c BUT IT ENDED AT CHEMICAL'S SUGGESTION
47zc021d <NOISE> WE ARE EXTREMELY SELECTIVE SAID PAUL SUCKOW DIRECTOR OF FIXED INCOME AT OPPENHEIMER MANAGEMENT CORPORATION
47zc021e I DON'T THINK SOME ISSUES ARE GOING TO MAKE IT HE SAID
47zc021f EVEN CAUTIOUS MANAGERS SUCH AS MR. SUCKOW ARE *SEEING* THE IMPACT OF THE CAMPEAU DEBACLE
47zc021g HE SAID HIS FIRM OWNS A SMALL AMOUNT OF THE FEDERATED SENIOR DEBT
47zc021h ALTHOUGH THE BONDS ARE SECURED BY BANK CREDITS THEY HAVE ALSO FALLEN IN PRICE RECENTLY
47zc0301 ANY SUCH AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE AIRLINES AND AIRPORT OPERATORS COULD BE WRITTEN INTO THE CONGRESSIONAL LEGISLATION REAUTHORIZING THE AVIATION TRUST FUND
47zc0302 THE TRUST FUND WHICH IS FINANCED BY *TICKET* AND FUEL TAXES HELPS PAY FOR F. A. A. OPERATIONS AND PROVIDES GRANTS TO AIRPORTS
47zc0303 SOME HAVE SUGGESTED THAT AIRPORT OPERATORS AS A CONDITION OF ACCEPTING THE GRANTS AGREE TO GIVE UP SOME AUTHORITY IN MAKING NOISE RULES
47zc0304 <NOISE> RAYTHEON DENIED THAT IT'S FREELY GIVING AWAY JOBS
47zc0305 WE AREN'T CRAZY ABOUT OFFSETS BUT WE'D ENTER INTO THEM AS A COMPROMISE BUSINESS AGREEMENT IF IT'S THE BEST THAT'S AVAILABLE SAID RAYTHEON SPOKESMAN LAWRENCE MCCRACKEN
47zc0306 HE ADDED THAT THERE WERE ALSO SOME POLITICAL AND NATIONAL SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS BEHIND THE DECISION <NOISE> TO SHARE THE PATRIOT BUSINESS WITH THE THREE U. S. ALLIES
47zc0307 TANDY MADE THE INFORMAL PRODUCT ANNOUNCEMENT AT A REGULAR GATHERING OF ABOUT TWO HUNDRED BUSINESS COMPUTER USERS AT THE COMPANY HEADQUARTERS
47zc0308 THE COMPANY ALSO SAID IT WOULD INTRODUCE ITS FIRST LASER PRINTER THIS YEAR
47zc0309 THE HIGH QUALITY PRINTERS ARE BECOMING A MUST COMPUTING *ACCESSORY* FOR BUSINESSES
47zc030a <NOISE> FLOATING FAILS WHEN GOVERNMENTS TRY TO ESCAPE FROM THE VERDICT OF THE EXCHANGE MARKETS ON THEIR POLICIES BY RESORTING TO DIRECT CONTROLS OVER TRADE AND CAPITAL FLOWS
47zc030b BECAUSE THIS LATTER THREAT IS NOW SO SEVERE THE WORLD IS RIGHT TO TALK ABOUT INTERNATIONAL MONETARY REFORM IF ONLY AS A DELAYING GAME
47zc030c BUT IDEALISTIC TALK SHOULD NOT DECEIVE STABILIZING EXCHANGE RATES REQUIRES DEPENDENCE AND SUB:ORDINATION NOT THE FREEDOM FOR EVERYBODY TO DO THEIR OWN THING
47zc030d THERE'S BEEN A COMPLETE TURNAROUND IN SHORT TERM SENTIMENT SAID THOMAS G. GRIBBON A SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT AT NOMURA SECURITIES INTERNATIONAL INCORPORATED
47zc030e FOR WEEKS PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TRADING BEARISHLY ON DOLLAR WEAKNESS AND A RISE IN THE C. R. B. INDEX
47zc030f DESPITE THE REVERSAL INVESTORS ARE STILL TAKING A CAUTIOUS STANCE AND USING THE LATEST RALLY AS A SELLING OPPORTUNITY HE ADDED
47zc030g THE FUND <NOISE> NUVEEN MUNICIPAL VALUE FUND INCORPORATED IS BEING CO MANAGED BY ALEX

47zc030k NOT LONG AGO TENNECO WAS CONSIDERED AN UNLIKELY RESTRUCTURING CANDIDATE
47zc030l ITS HEAVY DEBTS AND DEPRESSED ENERGY AND FARM EQUIPMENT BUSINESSES MADE IT APPEAR IMMUNE TO RAIDERS

480c0405 BEFORE FRIDAY IT SEEMED THAT ONLY AN UNEXPECTED BREAK IN DELAWARE'S COURT CASE COULD HAVE EXTRACTED HENLEYS FROM A DILEMMA IT NOW FACES
480c0406 THUS THE CASE WOULD CL- WAS CLOSELY WATCHED
480c0407 BUT IT ALSO RAISED IMPORTANT ISSUES OF CORPORATE LAW
480c0408 THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THESE WAS CONTENTION THAT SANTA FE'S BOARD A:CTED ILLEGALLY DECEMBER WHEN IT LOWERED THE THRESHHOLD FOR A SHAREHOLDER'S RIGHTS PLANS TO TWENTY PERCENT

480c0416 GETTING THE DEAL RIGHT IS THE KEY
480c0417 UNLIKE WARRANTS ON JAPANESE STOCKS DEALS FOR U. S. COMPANIES AREN'T REALLY COVERED BY THE OWNERSHIP OF UNDERLYING SHARES
480c0418 INSTEAD UNDERWRITERS USE WHAT THEY CALL DYNAMIC HEDGE

481c0205 THE WHITE HOUSE INTERVENED EARLIER LAST YEAR TO STOP THE POSTAL SERVICE FROM BANNING PRIVATE COMPANIES FROM SHIPPING BUNDLES OF LETTERS OVERSEAS TO BE POSITED DIRECTLY IN FOREIGN MAIL SYSTEMS
481c0206 BUT THIS WAS FAIRLY MINOR
481c0207 THE GOVERNMENT CIVIL SUIT ALLEGED THAT A DEFECT COULD CAUSE THE REAR BRAKES TO LOCK SENDING THE CAR SPINNING OUT OF CONTROL
481c0208 G. M. WHICH NO LONGER MAKES X. CARS DENIED THAT THE BRAKES ARE DEFECTIVE
481c0209 AGREEING WITH G. M. JUDGE JACKSON RULED THAT THE GOVERNMENT CAME TO COURT WITH NOTHING MORE ESSENTIALLY THAN A REASONABLE SUSPICION THAT A DEFECT EXISTED
481c020a BY NOW THERE IS LITTLE ELSE MR. FALCIGNO CAN DO TO HYPE ATTENDANCE
481c020b THAT DOESN'T MEAN HE DOESN'T HAVE OTHER WORRIES

481c020i THE SEVEN SIGNATORIES HAVE AGREED TO POLICIES AIMED AT REDUCING THEIR *INTERNAL* AND EXTERNAL IMBALANCES
481c020j THUS THEY ARE MAKING A CONTRIBUTION TO STABILIZING THEIR EXCHANGE RELATIONS JEOPARDIZED BY THE HIGHLY EXCESSIVE DEFICITS AND SURPLUSES THAT HAVE DEVELOPED IN RECENT YEARS
481c020k MOREOVER THEY ARE READY IF NEED BE TO INTERVENE ON EXCHANGE MARKETS

481c020m HE ESTIMATES PRIME'S DOMESTIC DO- BUSINESS MAY BE OFF TWENTY PERCENT TO TWENTY FIVE PERCENT WITH FOREIGN SALES UP BY ABOUT THE SAME PERCENTAGE
481c020n DOMESTIC SALES ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT HALF OF PRIME'S NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN REVENUE
481c020o AS A RESULT THE GOVERNMENT IS TALKING OF HIGHER FARM PRICES
481c020p BUT HIGHER FARM PRICES WOULD ADD TO AN ALREADY STEEP INFLATION RATE
481c020q SO BEIJING OFFICIALS REPORTEDLY TALK OF TYING WAGES TO INFLATION AN IDEA REMINISCENT OF THE WAGE INDEXATION TRIED IN SOME LATIN AMERICAN NATIONS SEVERAL YEARS AGO WITH DISASTROUS RESULTS
481c020r THE AGREEMENT CALLS FOR DOVER TO MAKE A TENDER OFFER FOR CHIEF AUTOMOTIVE'S EIGHT POINT THREE MILLION SHARES OUTSTANDING
481c020s EACH CHIEF AUTOMOTIVE SHARE THAT ISN'T TENDERED WILL BE CONVERTED INTO A RIGHT TO RECEIVE FIFTEEN DOLLARS IN CASH DOVER SAID
481c020t THE OFFER BEGAN TODAY AND IS SET TO EXPIRE AT MIDNIGHT EASTERN DAYLIGHT TIME JULY TWENTIETH
481c020u BANKAMERICA OFFICIALS HOPE THAT LIKE EARLIER PROBLEMS THE IMPROVING FINANCES WILL FEED ON THEMSELVES
481c020v IT IS COUNTING ON A STRONGER CREDIT RATING TO ALLOW IT TO BECOME MORE THAN A MINOR LEAGUER IN PITCHING LUCRATIVE INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY SWAPS
481c020w MONEY TO PROMOTE A FLAGGING GLOBAL CORPORATE COMPUTER SERVICE IS BECOMING AVAILABLE
481c020x SO IS SUPPORT FOR A BEEFED UP TEAM OF DEAL MAKERS TO BROKER MERGERS AMONG CALIFORNIA COMPANIES
481c020y NONE OF THESE AREAS HOWEVER HOLD THE PROSPECT OF QUICK GROWTH
481c020z SO FAR THE ADMINISTRATION HAS IGNORED THESE APPEALS AND SO HAVE MR. REED AND OTHER BANKERS
481c0210 IT SEEMS THAT THE PRINCIPLES ENUNCIATED AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS DECADE BY MESSRS.
481c0211 WRISTON AND THEOBALD STILL PREVAIL IF NOT IN LENDING THE BANK'S MONEY AT LEAST IN SUGGESTING THAT OTHER INVESTORS PUT UP THE CASH
481c0212 HOWEVER CONVENTIONAL FILM WILL BE MARGINALLY PROFITABLE AT BEST FOR POLAROID BECAUSE INITIALLY POLAROID WON'T BE MANUFACTURING THE FILM CONTENDS ELLIOTT NOVAK AN INDUSTRY CONSULTANT
481c0213 INSTEAD IT WILL BUY THE FILM FROM ANOTHER COMPANY AND PUT ITS NAME ON IT JUST AS IT DOES WITH VIDEOTAPE
481c0214 SINCE IT BEGAN SELLING VIDEOTAPE A FEW YEARS AGO POLAROID HAS BUILT UP AN IMPRESSIVE TWELVE PERCENT MARKET SHARE MAKING IT THE LEADER IN THE U. S.
481c0215 BUT FIERCE COMPETITION HAS KEPT VIDEOTAPE PROFITS SLIM AND THE CONVENTIONAL FILM BUSINESS ISN'T LIKELY TO PROVE ANY BONANZA EITHER
481c0216 REACTING TO THE EROSION OF CONFUCIAN VALUES MANY KOREANS ARE TURNING TO RELIGION ESPECIALLY CHRISTIANITY
481c0217 BUDDHISM IS ENJOYING A RESURGENCE AS WELL
481c0218 THEY'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING SAYS MR. SEO

481c0302 IN MID NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN THE COMPANY WILL BEGIN MAKING ELECTRONIC TYPEWRITERS IN BARTLETT TENNESSEE
481c0303 IT SET UP A SIMILAR PLANT IN WALES IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE
481c0304 AS A RESULT MANY INSURANCE ISSUES ARE DOWN TEN PERCENT TO TWENTY FIVE PERCENT FROM THEIR HIGHS REACHED MOSTLY LAST SPRING
481c0305 THE BULLS ARGUE HOWEVER THAT SELLERS ARE LEAVING THE PARTY TOO SOON
481c0306 FOR ONE THING THEY SAY THE LARGE PREMIUM INCREASES OF THE PAST FEW YEARS HAVE ONLY BEGUN TO APPEAR IN INSURERS' BOTTOM LINES
481c0307 FOR NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN EARNING GAINS OF TWENTY FIVE PERCENT TO MORE THAN FIFTY PERCENT FROM NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX LEVELS ARE ALMOST A CERTAINTY AT THESE COMPANIES
481c0308 AND MOST ANALYSTS EXPECT THE EARNINGS GROWTH TO CONTINUE ALBEIT AT A MORE MODEST RATE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT
481c0309 HOWEVER ONE SOURCE CLOSE TO THE COMPANIES SAID HE WOULDN'T RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF LIMITED BUYING I. MAGNIN
481c030a LIMITED CHAIRMAN LESLIE H. WEXNER HAS SAID HE IS INTERESTED IN OPERATING A SPECIALTY DEPARTMENT STORE
481c030b LIMITED OPERATES SUCH STORES AS LIMITED LIMITED EXPRESS LANE BRYANT HENRI BENDEL AND VICTORIA'S SECRET
481c030c TO GET AROUND THAT REQUIREMENT INSURERS CAN PAY A REINSURER TO ASSUME PART OF THE RISK OF LOSS ON THE ANNUITY IN RETURN FOR PART OF THE PREMIUM
481c030d BUT MOST REINSURANCE CONTRACTS DON'T TRANSFER INVESTMENT RISK THE RISK OF FAILING TO EARN ENOUGH TO PAY THE PROMISED RATES
481c030e THAT'S WHERE FIRST EXECUTIVE WHICH HAS RELIED HEAVILY ON REINSURANCE TO SUPPORT EXPANSION OF IT BUSINESS AND THE REGULATORS HAVEN'T AGREED ON THE PROPER FORM OF CONTRACT
481c030f THE KROH BROTHERS MISMANAGED BUT IT WAS NOT FOR THE PURPOSE OF LINING THEIR OWN POCKETS HE SAYS
481c030g THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN KANSAS CITY WHO HAVE TURNED THEIR BACKS ON THEM

481c030q STARTED COLLECTING SUPPORT CARDS FROM EMPLOYEES AND IF THIRTY PERCENT OF THE PLANT'S THREE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED WORKERS SIGN UP THE UNION CAN REQUEST AN ELECTION
481c030r MR. BIEBER SAID THE UNION HASN'T SET A DEADLINE TO COMPLETE THE DRIVE
481c030s AFTER COLLECTING THE SIGNATURES THE U. A. W. CAN ASK NISSAN TO RECOGNIZE THE UNION WITHOUT AN ELECTION ALTHOUGH ACQUIESCENCE BY NISSAN ISN'T CONSIDERED LIKELY

481c030x NOW I ONLY GO INTO THE GYM TWICE A WEEK AND IT'S LIKE RECESS THE FAVORITE PART OF MY DAY NOT AN INTRUSION ON MY LIFE
481c030y ANOTHER LESSON SHE CAME AWAY WITH IS THAT THE AMOUNT OF WEIGHT IS IRRELEVANT IN TERMS OF EXERCISING

481c0402 IN ADDITION TO TREATING FRACTURES THE DEVICES ARE USED TO TREAT DISORDERS WHERE SURGERY HAS FAILED AND FOR CERTAIN CONGENITAL DISORDERS THE COMPANY SAID
481c0403 BUT SOME ORTHOPEDIC SPECIALISTS DON'T THINK THE DEVICES WORK THE COMPANY ACKNOWLEDGED
481c0404 THE FOUR ZERO DECISION IS A SECOND VICTORY FOR BROADCASTERS PROMOTING A NEW TECHNOLOGY CALLED HIGH DEFINITION TELEVISION
481c0405 THOSE BROADCASTERS HAVE ARGUED THAT THEY WILL NEED ADDITIONAL TELEVISION FREQUENCIES TO TRANSMIT HIGH DEFINITION PICTURES
481c0406 BUT MOBILE RADIO COMPANIES HAVE URGED THE F. C. C. TO REALLOCATE THE FREQUENCIES FOR SUCH USES AS POLICE OR FIRE DEPARTMENT RADIO
481c0407 THE PROPOSED AGREEMENT IS AN INTERIM ARRANGEMENT THAT WOULD REQUIRE THAT THE TWO SIDES DRAW UP A FULL DEBT RESTRUCTURING FOR BRAZIL BY AROUND THE END OF THE YEAR
481c0408 BRAZIL ALSO WOULD BE REQUIRED TO AGREE ON AN ECONOMIC PROGRAM WITH THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
481c0409 ANY AGREEMENT WITH THE I. M. F. IS LIKELY TO PROVOKE STRONG OPPOSITION IN BRAZIL WHERE THE FUND IS LOATHED FOR PROMOTING AUSTERITY
481c040a AND THERE IS SPECULATION THAT MR. BRESSER MAY RESIGN OR ALLOW HIMSELF TO BE OUSTED AS A SACRIFICE FOR SECURING AN I. M. F. PROGRAM

481c040g EATING TRENDS HAVE CHANGED AND WE FIND THERE IS GREATER ACCEPTANCE OF COLD MEALS
481c040h A MERGER WITH MACY WHICH IS ROUGHLY HALF THE SIZE OF FEDERATED COULD BE ATTRACTIVE TO THE LARGER RETAILER'S EXECUTIVES
481c040i MACY'S SMALLER SIZE COULD LEAVE F:EDERATED'S OFFICERS WITH OPERATING POWER IN A COMBINED CONCERN
481c040j AND FEELINGS AT FEDERATED HAVE RUN HIGH AGAINST CAMPEAU WHICH SURPRISED THE COMPANY WITH A HOSTILE BID LAST MONTH

481c040z EVEN THOUGH THE ISSUE CONCERNED FUTURE SECURITY RATHER THAN TODAY'S SAFETY

481c0411 THESE ARE THE TRAITS THAT I RESPECT IN HIM AND ON WHICH WE HAVE BUILT A WARM PERSONAL FRIENDSHIP OVER THE YEARS
481c0412 MR. MINOLI THE U. S. GENERAL MANAGER SAYS BENETTON RECENTLY DROPPED ITS STRATEGY OF SATURATING THE MARKET WITH SMALL STORES
481c0413 NOW IT IS CONCENTRATING ON PROFESSIONALISM AND THE SERVICING OF EXISTING STORES HE SAYS
481c0414 NEW STORES WILL BE LARGER OUTLETS CALLED UNITED COLORS THAT WILL OFFER A MUCH BROADER RANGE OF MERCHANDISE
481c0415 BENETTON PLANS TO HAVE TEN UNITED COLORS SHOPS OPERATING IN THE U. S. BY NEXT SPRING

482c0201 FOR INVESTORS THE PARTNERSHIPS ARE ONLY AS ATTRACTIVE AS THE UNDERLYING BUYOUTS
482c0202 MANY IN THE FIELD CONTEND THAT THE BUYOUTS BEING PUT TOGETHER THESE DAYS ARE GENERALLY OVERPRICED BECAUSE OF SEVERAL FACTORS
482c0203 AMONG THEM TOO MUCH CAPITAL CHASING TOO FEW GOOD CANDIDATES WHICH HAS PUSHED COSTS UP AND RETURNS DOWN TO WHAT THEY SEE AS UNACCEPTABLE LEVELS
482c0204 <NOISE> THE S. E. C. SANCTIONS AGAINST THE FIRM AND MR. BLINDER WERE HANDED DOWN IN DECEMBER

482c0209 WE'RE SELLING EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF NOTES IN A PRIVATE PLACEMENT HE SAID
482c020a IF WE WERE USING REVLON ASSETS THE SUITS COULD BE TROUBLESOME

482c020k BUT IN JUNE SUDDENLY WITH NO APPARENT DRAINAGE IT WENT DOWN AND KEPT GOING DOWN HE SAYS

482c020r BOLSTERED BY STRONG EQUITY CAPITAL POSITIONS SUPERREGIONALS ALREADY ARE GROWING FASTER THAN MONEY CENTER INSTITUTIONS
482c020s PASSAGE OF THE KENNEDY MARKEY BILL OR SIMILAR GRANTS OF MORAL RIGHTS WOULD ENRICH ESTABLISHED ARTISTS AT THE EXPENSE OF THEIR STRUGGLING COMPETITORS
482c020t IN ADDITION THE THEORY OF MORAL RIGHTS IS BOTH PHILOSOPHICALLY UNTENABLE AND AN INVITATION TO AN ORGY OF LITIGATION AND LEGAL CONFUSION
482c020u CONGRESS SHOULD REFUSE TO GRANT ARTISTS SPECIAL RIGHTS AND SHOULD REFUSE TO SIGN THE BERN CONVENTION
482c020v THEY CLASSIFIED EVERYTHING I HAD TO SAY AS RACIST OR SEXIST SAYS MR. SCHAUB
482c020w WHERE'S THE FREEDOM OF INQUIRY

482c0211 ONE FEAR SAYS IRVING TRUST ECONOMIST ROBERT MCGEE IS THAT HIGHER GLOBAL RATES WILL SEND THE FINANCIAL MARKETS INTO A TAILSPIN
482c0212 BY CONTRACTING OUT PRODUCTION TO AMERICAN PLANTS THEY ARE SAVING MORE THAN A DIME PER CAN OF DRINK
482c0213 <NOISE> THEIR NEXT LOGICAL STEP ANALYSTS SAY WILL BE TO ACQUIRE U. S. SOFT DRINK CONCERNS
482c0214 <NOISE> EVENTUALLY THEY MIGHT EVEN BREAK INTO THE ENORMOUS U. S. MARKET

482c021c EDUCATION IS THE OPPORTUNITY THROUGH STUDYING A VARIETY OF SUBJECTS TO GAIN INFORMATION AND THE DEXTERITY TO USE YOUR WITS AND YOUR EXPRESSION
482c021d EDUCATION PREPARES YOU TO BE SOMEONE MORE THAN TO DO SOMETHING

482c0305 STOCK TRADERS CAUTIONED THAT THE GOVERNMENT HASN'T YET WON CONVICTIONS ON ITS LATEST CASES

482c031f THE UMPTEENTH SOUNDS OF LEAD SMACKING METAL AND A RIFLE BEING COCKED SERVED AS A QUICK ANSWER TO HIS QUESTION
482c0401 THEY HAVE PUT IN A LOT OF MONEY BUT IS THAT ENOUGH
482c0402 <NOISE> NOBODY KNOWS SAID MR. BRAY
482c0403 IN OCTOBER WE THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE ENOUGH BUT BETWEEN OCTOBER AND NOW IT'S PROVEN TO BE NOT ENOUGH
482c0404 <NOISE> WHO KNOWS HOW MUCH IT WILL BE
482c0405 <NOISE> WITH THE SPEAKER BEHIND IT GEPHARDT WILL PASS ON THE HOUSE FLOOR SAID REP. DONALD PEASE D. OHIO
482c0406 ADDED REP. BRIAN DONNELLY D. MASS. ON THE SPEAKER'S REMARKS IT COMES AS NO SURPRISE

482c040o IT'S TRUE AS A METAPHOR FOR THE HUMAN AND COSMIC MYSTERIES
482c040p IT'S ONLY WHEN YOU'RE STUCK ON THE METAPHOR THAT YOU GET IN TROUBLE

482c040t <NOISE> ACQUIRED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE FRIENDLY REPORTED MODEST GROWTH UNTIL LAST YEAR WHEN LABOR SHORTAGES AND LOWER CUSTOMER TRAFFIC HURT THE CHAIN
482c040u THE UNIT IMPROVED SALES WITH HIGHER PRICES NEW STORE OPENINGS AND THE ACQUISITION OF TWO SMALL RESTAURANT CHAINS DURING THE SECOND HALF OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX

482c040z STUDENTS BUDDHIST MONKS AND OTHERS PARTICIPATED IN THE DEMONSTRATIONS
482c0410 <NOISE> WE'VE ALWAYS WONDERED HOW TO SQUARE NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA'S ROUGH WORDS WITH HIS SOFT TREATMENT IN THE DEMOCRATIC CONTROLLED U. S. CONGRESS
482c0411 MAYBE HE HAS TOO BECAUSE HE'S UPPED THE ANTE
482c0412 HE HAS NOW BRANDED NOT ONLY THE REPUBLICANS BUT ALSO THE DEMOCRATS AS IMPERIALISTS BECAUSE BOTH PARTIES HAVE TALKED RECENTLY ABOUT HELPING THE CONTRAS
482c0413 WHAT DO THE DEMOCRATS BECOME IF THEY ACTUALLY VOTE THE BANDAGES
482c0414 THE TREASURY IS SCHEDULED TO ANNOUNCE DETAILS OF ITS QUARTERLY FINANCING OPERATION NOVEMBER SECOND
482c0415 <NOISE> IT USUALLY CONSISTS OF THREE YEAR NOTES TEN YEAR NOTES AND THIRTY YEAR BONDS
482c0416 BUT THE DEPARTMENT IS VERY CLOSE TO REACHING ITS LIMITS ON ISSUING LONG TERM DEBT AND THUS HAS ASKED CONGRESS TO INCREASE ITS AUTHORITY

483c0201 FIRST OF ALL THE POLICY CONSERVATIVES WILL PURSUE THEIR UNFINISHED AGENDA OF DEREGULATION IN AREAS <NOISE> FROM FINANCIAL SERVICE TO REGULATION AS A DRAG ON U. S. INTERNATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS
483c0202 THEY SAY THE ADMINISTRATION MISSED ITS CHANCE AND ALLOWED ITS DEREGULATION CAMPAIGN TO BE ALL BUT ABORTED BY CONTROVERSY OVER ANNE <NOISE> GORSUCH AND JIM WATT
483c0203 THEY THINK THEIR *GENERAL* CAUSE IN THIS AREA IS OVERWHELMING
483c0204 THEY WILL GIVE IT A NEW APPLICATION AND CARRY IT TO NEW FORUMS
483c0205 THE NEW SERVICE DIFFERS FROM THE SHUTTLE IN SEVERAL WAYS
483c0206 IT WON'T HAVE THE BACKUP PLANES THAT THE SHUTTLE USED TO ACCOMMODATE PASSENGER OVERFLOW
483c0207 THE NEW FLIGHTS WILL INCLUDE ADVANCE SEAT SELECTION AND FIRST CLASS AND COACH SERVICE WHICH THE SHUTTLE DOESN'T
483c0208 SHUTTLE FLIGHTS DEPART ON THE HOUR THE NEW SERVICE WILL OPERATE ON THE HALF HOUR
483c0209 MR. GITTIS SAID THE LAWSUITS WOULD HAVE LITTLE INFLUENCE ON THE RESPONSE OF REVLON'S BOARD TO THE NEW TENDER OFFER
483c020a HE SAID MACANDREWS AND FORBES RATHER THAN REVLON IS BORROWING THE MONEY NEEDED TO TO ACQUIRE REVLON AND TAKE IT PRIVATE
483c020b WE'RE SELLING EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION OF NOTES IN A FORM OF PRIVATE PLACEMENT HE SAID
483c020c IF WE WERE USING REVLON ASSET <NOISE> THE SUITS COULD BE TROUBLESOME
483c020d STILL MR. JOSEPHS AND OTHERS THINK THE CHANGES WILL BE GOOD FOR THE FARM ECONOMY IN GENERAL
483c020e MANY OF THESE GENTLEMEN FARMERS WERE TAX MOTIVATED NOT PROFIT MOTIVATED HE SAID -S
483c020f SOME ARE UNFAIR COMPETITION AGAINST THE REGULAR FARMER WHO'S TRYING TO MAKE A BUCK
483c020g ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO SOUTHLAND ACKNOWLEDGED THAT IT WAS CONSIDERING RESTRUCTURING ALTERNATIVES BUT IT WOULDN'T ELABORATE
483c020h THE OWNER AND OPERATOR OF EIGHTY TWO HUNDRED SEVEN ELEVEN STORES REPEATEDLY HAS SAID IT DIDN'T KNOW THE REASONS FOR THE HEAVY TRADING IN ITS STOCK

483c020l COMPANIES KEEP ASKING THE GOVERNMENT TO SMASH THE UNIONS
483c020m BUT THE RULING PARTY CAN'T RISK ALIENATING WORKERS WHO WILL VOTE IN THE COMING ELECTIONS
483c020n IT REFUSES SO FAR TO BACKTRACK ON ITS JULY FIRST PROMISE OF GREATER DE- DEMOCRACY OR TO RETURN TO THE POLICY OF OVERT UNION BUSTING
483c020o WORLD OF WONDER NEEDS TO CONVINCE CREDITORS TO EXTEND IT TIME THROUGH THE CHRISTMAS SEASON WHICH IS BY FAR THE BIGGEST SALES PERIOD FOR TOY COMPANY
483c020p IT'S IN THE CREDITORS' BEST INTEREST TO KEEP THE COMPANY GOING AT LEAST FOR NOW SAID FRED ANSCHEL AN ANALYST FOR DEAN WITTER REYNOLDS INC.
483c020q AS: OF SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH THE COMPANY'S INVENTORY WAS A HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT MILLION A SPOKESWOMAN SAID
483c020r CONGRESS'S JOINT TAX COMMITTEE NOW IS WITHOUT A S- CHIEF STAFF
483c020s DAVID BROCKWAY HAS LEFT AS PLANNED TO JOIN THE WASHINGTON LAW OFFICE OF DEWEY BALLANTINE BUSHBY PALMER AND WOOD
483c020t HIS SUCCESSOR HASN'T BEEN NAMED
483c020u BANKAMERICA IS NOW WRITING OFF FEWER OF ITS PROBLEM LOANS THAN MOST OTHER LARGE BANKS
483c020v THE DEVELOPMENT HAS LEFT SOME ANALYSTS WONDERING WHE(THER)- THE BANK IS BEING AGGRESSIVE E- ENOUGH ESPECIALLY CONSIDER ITS RECORD OF SURPRISING LOAN PROBLEMS OVER THE L- PAST THREE YEARS
483c020w BUT BANK OFFICIALS SAY THEY ARE BEING PRUDENT
483c020x THEY SAID LOWER WRITE OFFS REFLECT PREVIOUS HOUSECLEANING AS WELL AS MORE CONSERVATIVE LENDING PRACTICES
483c020y IN ADDITION THE BANK HAS HAD A BEEFED UP TEAM OF SPECIALISTS WHO ARE HAVING INCREASING SUCCESS IN RECOVERING PREVIOUSLY WRITTEN OFF LOANS
483c020z THE ONLY NEW ISSUE PRICED YESTERDAY WAS FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION OF TWELVE YEAR SENIOR SUBORDINATE DEBENTURES FROM U. S. G. CORPORATION
483c0210 THE HIGH RISK HIGH YIELD ISSUE WAS PRICED AT A PAR TO YIELD THIRTEEN AND A QUARTER PERCENT BY SALOMON BROTHERS INC. AND GOLDMAN SACHS AND COMPANY
483c0211 THE OFFERING IS PART OF U. S. G.'S RECAPITALIZATION PLAN
483c0212 MR. ZEHNDER PLAYS DOWN HIS CRITICISM
483c0213 HE POINTS TO THE FACT THAT CREDIT SUISSE LEADS IN ALL NUMBER OF PUBLICLY LISTED BONDS LAUNCHED BUT LAGS IN THE NUMBER OF OTHER L- UNLISTED NOTES IT ISSUED
483c0214 THIS IS SIGNIFICANT HE SAID BECAUSE BOND ISSUES PAY HIGHER COMMISSIONS THAN UNLISTED NOTES
483c0215 <NOISE> IN CONTRAST SENATOR BENTSEN CAMPAIGNED LAST WEEK IN A HALF EMPTY PLANE TO A MEASURED CADENCE
483c0216 HE PORTRAYS GOVERNOR DUKAKIS AS A PRAGMATIC CAN DO EXECUTIVE
483c0217 HE OFFERS HIMSELF A BUSINESS ORIENT SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN AND FORMER INSURANCE EXECUTIVE AS EVIDENCE OF THAT MODERATION
483c0218 THE REASSURING WORDS OF HIS SPEECHES ARE THE WORDS OF THE BOARDROOM COMPETENCE HAND ON MANAGEMENT ENHANCED RECOVERY
483c0219 MR. KIDDER INSISTS THERE IS A CAUSE FOR HOPE
483c021a GOOD TEACHERS PUT SNAGS IN THE RIVER OF CHILDREN PASSING BY AND OVER THE YEARS THEY REDIRECT HUNDREDS OF LIVES
483c021b PERHAPS HE IS RIGHT
483c021c BUT WHAT HE NOTICES AT THE FIFTH GRADE SCIENCE FAIR SEEMS MORE SIGNIFICANT
483c021d THE RESULTS OF THAT PAINFUL CHARADE DON'T REFLECT SOCIAL STATUS ETHNIC BACKGROUND OR TEACHING TECHNIQUE THEY REFLECT THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF EACH CHILD'S PARENTS
483c021e AVIATION INSURANCE IS UNDER INTENSE PRESSURE
483c021f THE GLOBAL AIRLINE PREMIUMS HAVE DROPPED TO ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED MILLION FROM ABOUT ONE BILLION IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
483c021g MEANWHILE AIRLINE LOSSES IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT ROSE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE PREVIOUS YEAR
483c0301 THE ECONOMIC FALLOUT SHOULDN'T BE IGNORED HOWEVER
483c0302 A PROVISION IN THE SPENDING BILL REQUIRES THAT AT LEAST ONE THIRD OF THE REPAIR AND OVERHEAD WORK ON SHIPS BE DONE LOCALLY AT THEIR HOME PORTS
483c0303 THAT MAKES IT A BIG DEAL FOR TODD AND LOCKHEED MR. DICKS SAID REFERRING TO TWO PUGET SOUND SHIPYARDS
483c0304 THE GOVERNMENT CIVIL SUIT ALLEGED THAT A DEFECT COULD CAUSE THE REAR HAND BRAKES TO LOCK SENDING THE CAR SPINNING OUT OF CONTROL
483c0305 G. M. WHICH NO LONGER MAKES X. CARS DENIED THE BRAKES ARE DEFECTIVE
483c0306 AGREEING WITH G. M. <NOISE> GENERAL JACKSON RULED THAT THE GOVERNMENT CAME TO COURT WITH NOTHING MORE ESSENTIALLY THAN A REASONABLE SUSPICION THAT A DEFECT EXISTED
483c0307 INCO'S STOCK HAS CAUGHT TECHNICAL ANALYSTS' ATTENTION TOO
483c0308 <NOISE> IT RECENTLY BROKE OUT OF A FIVE YEAR TRADING RANGE SAYS MARTIN PRING EDITOR OF PRING MARKET REVIEW
483c0309 <NOISE> HE THINKS THE STOCK COULD BE POISED FOR BIG GAINS REFLECTING WHAT MAY BE A BULL MARKET IN BASE METALS
483c030a <NOISE> RENT CONTROL IS AS BAD AS THE INCOME TAX DEDUCTION FOR HOME OWNERSHIP
483c030b ALL THE BENEFICIARIES OF THE DEDUCTION ARE HIGH INCOME EARNERS NOT SIMPLY SOME OF THEM
483c030c IT LEADS TO EXTRA LARGE SWIMMING POOLS EXTRA BEDROOMS IN BEVERLY HILLS BUT NO HOUSING FOR PEOPLE WHO NEED IT MOST
483c030d STILL WHEN THIS ISSUE WAS LAST VOTED IN CONGRESS EIGHTY FIVE OUT OF THE EIGHTY FIVE SENATORS PRESENT VOTED FOR IT
483c030e THE ONLY SURPRISING THING GIVEN THE NUMBER OF BENEFICIARIES IS THAT SOMEHOW THE OTHER FIFTEEN SENATORS DIDN'T MANAGE TO GET THEIR NAMES ON THE ROLL CALL
483c030f MR. ZINN SAID ENTERTAINMENT MARKETING IS STILL WEIGHING A PROXY FIGHT
483c030g IT'S A BAD FEELING IN YOUR STOMACH WHEN THE CHAIRMAN AND PREVIOUS BIDDER IS SELLING HIS BLOCK HE SAID
483c030h IT DOESN'T MAKE ME AS A SHAREHOLDER COMFORTABLE WITH WHAT IS HAPPENED TO THE COMPANY
483c030i <NOISE> UNDER THE PLAN THE EDELMAN GROUP WILL CONTRIBUTE ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION IN EQUITY TO THE TRANSACTION
483c030j THE REMAINDER WOULD BE FINANCED WITH DEBT AND DEBT SECURITIES
483c030k IF THE PLAN SUCCEEDS SHEARSON WOULD BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE WARRANTS TO BUY TEN PERCENT TO TWENTY PERCENT OF THE <NOISE> FULLY DILUTED COMMON EQUITY IN THE COMPANY

483c030m FIDELITY'S PACKERS HE SAID SPREAD THE PEREZ FAMILY FURNISHINGS IN THE FRONT YARD THEN LEFT FOR AN EXTENDED LUNCH BREAK
483c030n MINUTES LATER THERE WAS A DRENCHING RAIN
483c030o IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR WHEN HE RETURNED MUCH OF THE FURNITURE WAS S- SOGGY AND MOLDY
483c030p WHILE CHRONICLING THE DOINGS OF THE HIGHFALUTIN MAY SEEM LIGHT STUFF TO SOME MR. REVSON SAYS HIS OWN APPROACH TO THE SUBJECT DOESN'T MATTER
483c030q IT ISN'T JUST THROWING TOGETHER A STRING OF NAMES AND SAYING THEY SIPPED CHAMPAGNE EAT CAVIAR WORE BILL BLASS THE *COLUMNIST* SAYS
483c030r FACTS ARE IMPORTANT
483c030s IF YOU SAY SOMEONE IS WEARING A RED TIE THEN HE SHOULD BE WEARING A RED TIE
483c030t GENLYTE DESIGNS AND MAKES LIGHTING FIXTURES AND ELECTRICAL LIGHTING CONTROLS
483c030u OTHER BARINCO UNITS MAKE ELECTRICAL PRODUCTS COMPOSITE MATERIALS AND ELECTROMAGNETIC SHIELDING SYSTEMS
483c030v IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN THE NEW YORK BASED BARINCO EARNED TWENTY EIGHT POINT TWO MILLION OR TWO <NOISE> POINT SIX EIGHT DOLLARS PER SHARE
483c030w <NOISE> THE KING'S REQUEST LEFT THE DELEGATES IN A TIGHT SPOT
483c030x <NOISE> TO IGNORE JORDAN AND MAKE A SUBSTANTIAL FORMAL CASH PLEDGE TO THE P. L. O. WOULD SIGNAL A SHIFT AWAY FROM MODERATION DIFFICULT FOR THE GULF STATES TO *COUNTENANCE*
483c030y BUT TO FINANCE BOTH JORDAN AND THE P. L. O. RISKED *TRIGGERING* A CLAMOR FROM BOTH THE CASH STRAPPED STATES COVERED UNDER THE BAGHDAD AGREEMENT SUCH AS LEBANON AND SYRIA
483c030z BUT OTHER EVIDENCE ON THE FLAP IS CONFLICTING
483c0310 ONE OF THE CREW MEMBERS CAN BE HEARD ON THE COCKPIT VOICE RECORDER CALLING OUT FLAPS FIFTEEN FIFTEEN THE CORRECT POSITION FOR THE FLAPS
483c0311 AND THE RECORDER INDICATES THE COCKPIT ALARM SHOULD HAVE ALERTED THE CREW TO THE IMPROPERLY SET FLAPS DIDN'T GO OFF
483c0312 WHEN THE HOUSE AND SENATE APPROVED THE BILL EARLY IN SEPTEMBER LAWMAKERS DIDN'T MENTION THE LAST MINUTE PROVISIONS AND CONGRESSIONAL STAFFERS DESCRIBED THEM AS TECHNICAL
483c0313 WHILE THE E- ESTIMATED REVENUE OF ALMOST A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OVER THREE YEARS IS RELATIVELY SMALL PROVISION MIGHT BE PERCEIVED AS A ANTI TAKEOVER PUSH BY CONGRESS
483c0314 THEY COULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF SHOWING CERTAIN TAKEOVER ACTIVITIES CONGRESSIONAL SOURCES ACKNOWLEDGED OVER THE WEEKEND
483c0315 TO BE SURE THE DEFICIT HAS DECLINED IN THE LAST FEW YEARS
483c0316 BUT THAT DECLINE IS ENTIRELY RESULT OF RISING SURPLUS IN THE SOCIAL SECURITY TRUST FUND
483c0317 THAT MONEY SHOULD BE INVESTED TO HELP DEFRAY THE FUTURE RETIREMENT COSTS OF THE BABY BOOMERS INSTEAD IT IS BEING USED TO PAPER OVER THE DEFICIT
483c0318 THAT'S YET ANOTHER SYMPTOM OF MR. DANSFORTH'S NATIONWIDE NOW NOW ISMS
483c0319 THIS YEAR THE SOVIETS HAVE MOVED COMMERCIAL SALES TO THE FRONT BURNER
483c031a THE EXPORT ARM OF THE SOVIET MINISTRY OF AVIATION HOPES TO DOUBLE ITS REVENUES BY THE MID NINETEEN NINETIES
483c031b BUT SUCH A SHIFT WOULD BRING MAJOR UPHEAVALS TO THE SOVIET SYSTEM
483c031c ORDERS FOR MILITARY AIRCRAFT HAVE FALLEN TWENTY PERCENT IN THE PAST TWO YEARS ACCORDING TO SOME ESTIMATES
483c031d AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN DECADES PRESTIGIOUS MILITARY DESIGN BUREAUS IN THE SOVIET UNION ARE DEVOTING SUBSTANTIAL MANPOWER TO CIVILIAN PROJECTS
483c031e ASHTON TATE HAS BEEN PLAGUED BY OPERATING LOSSES AND MANAGEMENT TURMOIL
483c031f IN THE LAST MONTH IT REPORTED A NINETEEN POINT EIGHT MILLION SECOND QUARTER NET LOSS AS WELL AS THE RESIGNATION OF ITS PRESIDENT AND CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER

483c0402 IN NARROWLY DRAWN STATEMENT VICE CHAIRMAN HERBERT FREIMAN DENIED SHEARSON HAD OFFERED A BLOCK OF SALOMON BROTHERS <NOISE> WHICH MANAGED THE SELLING BROKERS' FLOOR O- OPERATIONS
483c0403 MR. *FREIMAN* WOULDN'T ELABORATE
483c0404 THAT MAY BE BUT THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH TOUGH CALLS
483c0405 EMOTIONAL UPSETS HEADACHES BACKACHES AND OTHER SUBJECTIVE SYMPTOMS ARE HARD TO QUANTIFY
483c0406 BESIDES SOMEONE WHO TRULY FEELS DISABLED MAY AS A RESULT ACTUALLY BE DISABLED
483c0407 A WELL TIMED PERIOD OF TIME OFF WITH STRESS REDUCTION AND AN EFFORT TO BETTER UNDERSTANDING MAY PREVENT A MUCH WORSE DISABILITY LATER
483c0408 IT MAY ALSO UNCOVER FACTORS IN THE MARKETPLACE THAT CAN BE IMPROVED
483c0409 *I* TRY TO GIVE THE PATIENT THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT *WITHIN* REASON
483c040a NOT DOING SO IS MORE THAN UNKIND IT *RISKS* HARM TO THE PATIENT AND LAWSUITS THAT NEITHER THE PHYSICIAN NOR THE EMPLOYER WOULD WELCOME
483c040b BUT SOME FIND ELECTRONIC INVESTING ISN'T WORTH THE TROUBLE
483c040c MR. JEFFERS ESTIMATES THAT A THIRD OF INVESTMENT SOFTWARE BUYERS EVENTUALLY JUNK THEIR PURCHASE BECAUSE THE TECHNOLOGY BAFFLES THEM
483c040d <NOISE> AND WHILE SOME INVESTORS SAY COMPUTERS HAVE MADE THEM MONEY OTHERS HAVE SQUANDERED SMALL FORTUNES BECAUSE THEY RELIED TOO HEAVILY ON TECHNOLOGY
483c040e BANKERS SAY CHILE MEXICO AND THE PHILIPPINES HAVE ACCOUNTED FOR MOST OF THE ESTIMATED SIX BILLION IN DEBT EQUITY SWAPS TO DATE
483c040f SOME BANKERS HAVE ESTIMATED THAT THE TOTAL MAY RISE AS HIGH AS TEN BILLION THIS YEAR
483c040g SUCH SWAPS ONLY BEGAN ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO
483c040h THE UTILITY WILL BEGIN PAYING INTEREST IN CASH AFTER SEABROOK GOES INTO SERVICE MR. BAYLESS SAID

483c040p THE HUGE GAP TO A LARGE EXTENT IS A PRICE PHENOMENA
483c040q <NOISE> THE DOLLAR'S FALL HAS PUSHED UP THE PRICE OF IMPORTS CAUSING THE DEFICIT TO SWELL EVEN AS THE VOLUME OF NON OIL IMPORTS HAS RECEDED

484c0202 <NOISE> I'M DIMLY AWARE THAT THEY'RE OUT THERE SAYS RICHARD ULLMAN PROFESSOR OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS AT PRINCETON UNIVERSITY AND A FORMER EDITOR OF FOREIGN POLICY MAGAZINE
484c0203 BUT I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT PEOPLE WHO PUBLISH SOMETHING THAT'S IMPORTANT WOULDN'T WANT TO PUBLISH IN THE LEADING JOURNALS
484c0204 THE UTILITY WILL BEGIN PAYING INTEREST IN CASH AFTER SEABROOK GOES INTO SERVICE MR. BAYLESS SAID
484c0205 MR. HARRISON SAID THE COMPANY DOESN'T KNOW HOW LONG IT WILL TAKE TO LEAP THE POLITICAL HURDLES THAT ARE BLOCKING SEABROOK
484c0206 BUT THE FINANCIAL RESTRUCTURING IS INTENDED TO KEEP THE COMPANY GOING WITHOUT ADDITIONAL BORROWING UNTIL NINETEEN NINETY OR NINETEEN NINETY ONE HE SAID
484c0207 ANALYSTS ALSO SAID THEY HADN'T EXPECTED LOWER OPERATING PROFITS FOR THE COMPANY'S INDUSTRIES GROUP AND FOR THE BROADCASTING SEGMENT
484c0208 WESTINGHOUSE OFFICIALS TOLD ANALYSTS THAT OPERATING PROFIT IN THE INDUSTRIES GROUP FELL FIFTEEN TO TWENTY PERCENT HURT IN PART BY WEAK RESULTS IN CANADIAN OPERATIONS
484c0209 <NOISE> A SHARP DROP IN OPERATING PROFIT FROM THE BROADCASTING GROUP'S PRODUCTION COMPANY CONTRIBUTED TO THE SLIGHTLY LOWER OPERATING EARNINGS OVERALL FOR THAT SEGMENT
484c020a KEMP'S CAMPAIGN TAKES ON AN INCREASINGLY DESPERATE TONE
484c020b IN ONE SURE SIGN OF A CANDIDACY IN TROUBLE HE LASHES OUT AT CRITICISM FROM A LIGHTLY REGARDED T. V. COMMENTATOR
484c020c EVEN SOME SUPPORTERS NOW SAY PRIVATELY THAT HE SHOULD AIM FOR THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION
484c020d BUT HIS LONGTIME HOSTILITIES WITH DOLE LEAVE A SPOT ON A BUSH TICKET AS ABOUT THE ONLY POSSIBILITY
484c020e THOSE LANDS HAVE BECOME WORTH MUCH MORE THAN THE TRANSPORTATION AND ENERGY CONCERN NEEDS FOR THE RAILROAD AND THE COMPANY HAD BEEN TRYING TO FREE ITSELF FROM THE LIENS
484c020f LAST SPRING BURLINGTON AGREED TO PAY REMAINING BONDHOLDERS A TOTAL OF THIRTY FIVE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN RETURN FOR PERMISSION TO REMOVE THE COVENANTS
484c020g A JUDGE APPROVED THE AGREEMENT IN NOVEMBER AND IT BECAME FINAL JANUARY TWELFTH
484c020h AFTER DEDUCTING NONRECURRING ITEMS THE U. S. X. STEEL UNIT NONETHELESS APPEARED TO TURN IN ONE OF ITS MOST PROFITABLE QUARTERS SINCE THE NINETEEN SIXTIES
484c020i <NOISE> ON A PER TON BASIS PRETAX PROFIT DOUBLED TO ABOUT THIRTY SIX DOLLARS FROM EIGHTEEN DOLLARS IN THE THIRD QUARTER
484c020j HOWEVER THE PERFORMANCE FELL FAR SHORT OF U. S. X. CHAIRMAN DAVID RODERICK'S PREDICTION OF FIFTY DOLLARS PLUS PER TON PROFIT
484c020k TEXAS OF COURSE IS WHERE THE MOST TROUBLE IS TO BE FOUND
484c020l LENDERS THERE LIKE TO BLAME THE SO CALLED OIL PATCH RECESSION
484c020m BUT THE PROBLEM IN FACT IS BAD BANKING IN A FEW CASES EVEN CORRUPT BANKING
484c020n <NOISE> SOME PARTS OF TEXAS THE DALLAS FORT
484c020o WORTH AREA FOR EXAMPLE HAVEN'T HAD ANYTHING THAT LEGITIMATELY COULD BE CALLED A RECESSION
484c020p THE MAIN REASON SO MANY LENDERS ARE IN TROUBLE IS AN OLD FASHIONED FAILING AMONG BANKERS A WEAKNESS FOR REAL ESTATE SPECULATION
484c020q AS A RESULT THE GOVERNMENT IS TALKING OF HIGHER FARM PRICES
484c020r BUT HIGHER FARM PRICES WOULD ADD TO AN ALREADY STEEP INFLATION RATE
484c020s SO BEIJING OFFICIALS REPORTEDLY TALK OF TYING WAGES TO INFLATION AN IDEA REMINISCENT OF THE WAGE INDEXATION TRIED IN SOME LATIN AMERICAN NATIONS SEVERAL YEARS AGO WITH DISASTROUS RESULTS
484c020t SECRETARIES ARE ALSO EASY TARGETS FOR A HUG ESPECIALLY IN HOLLYWOOD
484c020u I'VE SEEN A WRITER WALK INTO AN OFFICE AND PULL A SECRETARY UP AGAINST HIM
484c020v SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO SAYS CHARLES FRIES CHAIRMAN OF FRIES ENTERTAINMENT INCORPORATED
484c020w NOT TO WORRY SAYS H. FLINT RANNEY A LOCAL REAL ESTATE AGENT
484c020x WE HAVE A GREAT SENSE OF HUMOR HE SAYS
484c020y WE'LL TAKE ALMOST ANYTHING
484c020z BESIDES HE ADDS NEW YORKERS COME HERE ALL THE TIME WE JUST WOULDN'T WANT THEM TO LIVE HERE
484c0210 ONE BIG PLAY LAST YEAR WAS LEISURE
484c0211 ANOTHER WAS UNDERVALUED ASSETS EVEN THOUGH NO ONE CAN RECALL A JAPANESE COMPANY BEING BROKEN UP FOR ITS ASSETS
484c0212 ONCE YOU GET THAT THEME THE LEVEL OF THE P. E. RATIO DOESN'T MEAN A DAMN SAYS MR. ROBINS
484c0213 IT'S ALL A BIT OF A MIRAGE
484c0214 YET ONE THAT SO FAR HAS WORKED
484c0215 <NOISE> BUT OTHER EVIDENCE ON THE FLAPS IS CONFLICTING
484c0216 ONE OF THE CREW MEMBERS CAN BE HEARD ON THE COCKPIT VOICE RECORDER CALLING OUT FLAPS FIFTEEN FIFTEEN THE CORRECT POSITION FOR THE FLAPS
484c0217 AND THE RECORDER INDICATES THAT A COCKPIT ALARM THAT SHOULD HAVE ALERTED THE CREW TO IMPROPERLY SET FLAPS DIDN'T GO OFF
484c0218 <NOISE> WHAT BOTHERS THESE PEOPLE IS NOT THAT MRS. THATCHER POSES A DANGER TO THE SO CALLED UNIFIED EUROPEAN MARKET
484c0219 MRS. THATCHER IS NOT OPPOSED TO THIS
484c021a BRITAIN'S OWN MARKETS ARE MORE OPEN THAN THOSE OF MOST EUROPEAN COUNTRIES LONDON IS WAY AHEAD OF THEM ON CAPITAL MOVEMENT HAVING ABOLISHED EXCHANGE CONTROLS ALTOGETHER
484c021b <NOISE> THE CAUSE OF THE OUTRAGE IS THAT EUROPEAN UNITY IS THE DEVICE THROUGH WHICH THE REGULATORS AND SOCIALISTS HOPE TO EXPAND THEIR GRIP ON THE CONTINENT
484c021c NOW HIS LAUGHTER IS GONE
484c021d BECAUSE OF DRUGS HE IS DEAD
484c021e <NOISE> AND EVERY DAY MY HEART BREAKS A LITTLE MORE
484c021f ON THE SURFACE THE TRADE REPORT LOOKED ENCOURAGING
484c021g THE NATION'S SEASONALLY ADJUSTED TRADE DEFICIT NARROWED TO EIGHT POINT ONE SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN JUNE THE LOWEST MONTHLY DEFICIT SINCE DECEMBER NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR
484c021h WHAT'S MORE THE MAY TRADE DEFICIT WAS REVISED DOWN TO TEN POINT ZERO TWO BILLION DOLLARS FROM THE TEN POINT TWO FOUR BILLION DOLLARS ORIGINALLY REPORTED
484c0301 SO FAR ILLEGAL FOREIGN WORKERS AREN'T TAKEN AS A JOB THREAT BY JAPANESE WORKERS
484c0302 <NOISE> BUT JAPANESE UNEMPLOYMENT IS AT HISTORICALLY HIGH LEVELS BECAUSE OF THE YEN'S STRENGTH POSING A KNOTTY PROBLEM FOR THE GOVERNMENT
484c0303 MANY JAPANESE COMPANIES IN SUCH INDUSTRIES AS STEEL AND SHIPBUILDING ARE CUTTING THEIR LABOR FORCES
484c0304 IN THE PAST FILIPINOS IN MANY RURAL AREAS PREFERRED THE DISCIPLINED TERROR OF THE N. P. A. TO THE RANDOM EXCESSES OF THE COUNTRY'S MILITARY
484c0305 WITH THE CHANGE OF GOVERNMENT LAST YEAR A MILD IMPROVEMENT IN MILITARY BEHAVIOR AND THE DETECTION OF THE MINDANAO SLAUGHTERS SOME FILIPINOS ARE CHANGING THEIR MINDS
484c0306 DIPLOMATS AND POLITICAL ANALYSTS SAY THEY DON'T KNOW IF THE TREND PRESAGES SIGNIFICANT POPULAR RESISTANCE TO THE COMMUNISTS OR JUST ADDITIONAL TURMOIL IN THE PHILIPPINE COUNTRYSIDE
484c0307 THERE IS A WIDE VARIATION IN THINKING ABOUT HOW SICK ONE IS AND HOW IMPORTANT TIME OFF IS IN ORDER TO GET WELL
484c0308 THE PATIENTS' RESPONSIBILITIES OUTSIDE OF WORK ALSO VARY
484c0309 IT'S HARD TO SAY TO WHAT DEGREE THESE FACTORS SHOULD INFLUENCE DISABILITY STATUS
484c030a <NOISE> MOST PHYSICIANS PROBABLY CONSIDER THEM IMPORTANT
484c030b IN CLEVELAND HIGBEE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER ROBERT BROADBENT SAYS THE RETAILER HAS BENEFITED FROM ITS PARENT'S FINANCIAL EXPERTISE
484c030c ALTHOUGH IT WILL RETAIN CONTROL INDUSTRIAL EQUITY IS PLANNING TO TAKE HIGBEE PUBLIC AGAIN PROBABLY IN JUNE
484c030d MEANWHILE SAYS MR. BROADBENT THEY'VE MADE US MORE INQUISITIVE ABOUT ACQUISITIONS OURSELVES
484c030e THE LOAN IS PART OF A SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR PLAN TO EXPAND THE MINE'S RESERVES AND ALLOW IT TO KEEP OPERATING UNTIL NINETEEN NINETY FOUR
484c030f WITHOUT THE EXPANSION THE MINE WAS THREATENED WITH CLOSURE NEXT YEAR
484c030g CLOSURE WOULD MEAN THE LOSS OF SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN JOBS
484c030h ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS ARE CONCERNED BY INTELLIGENCE REPORTS THAT SUGGEST IRAN IS THINKING ABOUT ORGANIZING TERRORIST STRIKES AGAINST AMERICAN WEST EUROPEAN AND ARAB TARGETS
484c030i THE ADMINISTRATION HAS ALERTED EMBASSIES AND MILITARY BASES OF AN INCREASED THREAT
484c030j ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS SAY INTELLIGENCE ALSO SHOWS THAT IRAN HAS LAID THE GROUNDWORK FOR TERRORISM IN THE U. S.
484c030k <NOISE> WITHIN AN HOUR BARCLAYS P. L. C. LLOYDS BANK P. L. C. AND THE LONDON UNIT OF CITICORP INCREASED THEIR BASE RATES
484c030l THE BARCLAYS BOOST TOOK EFFECT IMMEDIATELY WHILE THE OTHER TWO BANKS' MOVES WERE EFFECTIVE AT THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS
484c030m SIMILAR INCREASES BY NATIONAL WESTMINSTER BANK P. L. C. AND MIDLAND BANK P. L. C. GO INTO EFFECT TODAY
484c030n BASE RATES ARE THE BENCHMARK FOR COMMERCIAL LENDING IN BRITAIN
484c030o THE FOLLOWING OFFICERS DIRECTORS AND LARGE STOCKHOLDERS OF COMPANIES REPORTED CHANGES IN HOLDINGS UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF NINETEEN THIRTY FOUR
484c030p THOSE IDENTIFIED AS BENEFICIAL OWNERS HOLD AT LEAST TEN PERCENT OF A COMPANY'S EQUITY SECURITIES
484c030q UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED CHANGES INVOLVED DIRECT HOLDINGS OF COMMON STOCK AND TOOK PLACE IN MAY NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT
484c030r COMPANIES ARE LISTED WHERE TRANSACTIONS GENERALLY AGGREGATE TEN THOUSAND SHARES OR ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS
484c030s ANOTHER CONDITION IS THAT TOPEKA GROUP A UNIT OF DULUTH MINNESOTA BASED MINNESOTA POWER AND LIGHT COMPANY EXERCISE ITS OPTION TO BUY DELTONA'S UTILITY SUBSIDIARIES
484c030t BASED ON CURRENT BOOK VALUE THE SUBSIDIARIES WOULD FETCH THIRTY TWO POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN CASH PLUS PREFERRED STOCK IN ONE OF THE UTILITY UNITS
484c030u TOPEKA SAID IT INTENDS TO EXERCISE THE OPTION
484c030v THE BIGGEST HURDLE WAS TO FIND THE FUNDS TO MEET THE COST OF RECONSTRUCTION INCLUSIVE OF THE ISSUE OF STAMPS
484c030w HOWEVER THE RESPONSE TO THE GOVERNMENT'S INTERNATIONAL APPEAL FOR ASSISTANCE HAS BEEN EXTREMELY HEARTWARMING
484c030x THE FUNDS REQUIRED FOR PUBLIC SECTOR ASSISTANCE HAVE BEEN REALIZED AND THE FURTHER AMOUNT REQUIRED IS EXPECTED TO FLOW FROM THE PROCEEDS OF OVERSEAS REINSURANCE OF PROPERTY DAMAGE
484c030y TO BEGIN WITH COMPANIES HAVE BEEN DOING A GOOD JOB OF MANAGING INVENTORIES
484c030z IN THE PAST BUSINESSES HAVE TENDED TO BECOME INCREASINGLY OPTIMISTIC AS EXPANSIONS PERSISTED
484c0310 WHEN SALES EVENTUALLY SLOWED INVENTORIES QUICKLY REACHED EXCESSIVE LEVELS
484c0311 COMPANIES THEREUPON CUT THEIR BUYING INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION DECLINED AND A RECESSION WAS UNDER WAY
484c0312 THIRTY ONE TEAMS OF NINETEEN REPRESENTING BUSINESSES SCHOOLS AND ASSORTED OTHER GROUPS SIGNED UP FOR THE FIRST LOCAL COMPETITION
484c0313 FOR WEEKS DRUMS WERE HEARD ALONG THE WILLAMETTE AS THE TEAMS PRACTICED
484c0314 BOATS FULL OF MEN AND WOMEN IN BUSINESS SUITS FRESH FROM WORK OR HAPPY HOUR WERE NOT AN UNCOMMON SIGHT
484c0315 THESE MIXED FEELINGS OF FRUSTRATION WITH AND GRATITUDE TOWARD THE AUTHORITIES ARE PART OF THE EVERYDAY LIFE OF A FOREIGNER DOING BUSINESS IN KOREA
484c0316 <NOISE> IN FACT SUCH CONTRADICTIONS ARE WHAT SEEM TO MAKE THE KOREAN WORLD GO ROUND
484c0317 A WESTERN BUSINESSMAN NEEDS TO BE READY FOR THEM
484c0318 HERE ARE A FEW HARD LEARNED FACTS OF KOREAN BUSINESS LIFE
484c0319 BUT MANY LOCAL BUSINESSES THAT DEPEND ON TOURISM AREN'T CONVINCED
484c031a THEY ARGUE THAT A COMMERCIAL MINE MIGHT GET PLAYED OUT IN A FEW YEARS
484c031b AND THEY FEAR THAT MANY TOURISTS WHO TREK HERE FOR THE TANTALIZING PROSPECT OF FINDING A DIAMOND IN THE FIELD WILL TAKE THEIR VACATIONS ELSEWHERE
484c0401 THE COURT WAS SPLIT ON BOTH THE WILLIAMS ACT AND COMMERCE CLAUSE
484c0402 JUSTICE LEWIS POWELL ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO CASE OF EDGAR V.
484c0403 MITE SUGGESTED THAT ANY STATE LAW THAT FAVORED TARGETS MORE THAN DID THE WILLIAMS ACT WOULD BE INVALID BECAUSE CONGRESS HAD PREEMPTED LOCAL REGULATIONS
484c0404 THE COURT BACKTRACKED HERE TO SAY STATE LAWS MIGHT BE O. K. IF THEY HELP THE WILLIAMS ACT'S PURPOSE BY HEAPING EVEN MORE BURDENS ON ACQUIRERS
484c0405 IT HAS RELIEVED AT LEAST SOME OF THE FRUSTRATION FELT BY THE FARMERS SAYS PETER BRENT A MEMBER OF A FARM ACTIVIST GROUP
484c0406 IF THEY GO TO MEDIATION AT LEAST THE LENDER HAS TO LISTEN
484c0407 NEARLY A DOZEN OTHER STATES HAVE INQUIRED INTO IOWA'S PROGRAM
484c0408 AND MANDATORY MEDIATION MODELED ON IOWA'S PROGRAM IS CURRENTLY BEING CONSIDERED BY THE CALIFORNIA AND MISSOURI LEGISLATURES
484c0409 OGILVY IS THE NATION'S FIFTH LARGEST ADVERTISING AGENCY WITH NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX BILLINGS OF THREE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS
484c040a ROUGHLY HALF OF THOSE BILLINGS CAME FROM OUTSIDE THE U. S. MR. ROMAN SAID
484c040b AGENCIES TRADITIONALLY HAVE TAKEN FIFTEEN PERCENT OF BILLINGS AS A COMMISSION
484c040c L. T. V. HAS SAID REPEATEDLY SINCE ITS FILING THAT IT WOULD FIGHT ANY CREDITOR MOVE TO EITHER REORGANIZE THE UNIT SEPARATELY OR FORCE ITS SALE
484c040d CREDITORS ON THE OTHER HAND HAVE DISCUSSED THE IDEA ALMOST SINCE THE DAYS OF L. T. V.'S FILING
484c040e AND THE PENSION AGENCY THE BANKS AND THE COMMITTEE REPRESENTING UNSECURED CREDITORS HAVE RECENTLY BEEN HOLDING SERIOUS DISCUSSIONS ON THE ISSUE
484c040f <NOISE> IN REACTION TO THE NEWS INTEREST RATES PLUNGED THE AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR FIRMED AND ANALYSTS PREDICTED STOCKS WOULD MOVE HIGHER
484c040g BUT WHILE THE BUDGET GAVE A BOOST TO THE MARKETS IT ALSO PRESAGED GREATER AUSTERITY FOR THE NATION AS A WHOLE
484c040h TO MR. HAWKE THAT IS AS IT SHOULD BE
484c040i AUSTRALIANS HAVE GOT TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE AREN'T OUT OF THE WOODS YET HE SAYS
484c040j WE'VE GOT ENORMOUS PROBLEMS AND WE HAVE TO LEARN TO LIVE WITHIN OUR RESOURCES
484c040k DESPITE ALL THE UNCERTAINTY THAT SURROUNDED BRITISH PETROLEUM'S JUMBO OFFERING THERE WASN'T THAT MUCH TURMOIL IN THE MARKET WHEN SHARES BEGAN TO TRADE FRIDAY
484c040l B. P.'S PARTIALLY PAID AMERICAN DEPOSITARY SHARES CLOSED UNCHANGED AT SEVENTEEN AND A QUARTER WITH THIRTEEN POINT TWO MILLION TRADED
484c040m IT WAS THE BIG BOARD'S MOST ACTIVE ISSUE
484c040n THE ROLLBACKS COULD BE UNEXPECTEDLY PAINFUL FOR SOME HOURLY WORKERS
484c040o CHRYSLER'S UNEMPLOYMENT FUND HAS BEEN DRAINED TO THE POINT THAT BENEFITS ARE ALREADY BEING REDUCED A U. A. W. SPOKESMAN SAID
484c040p THE FUND HAS AT LEAST IN PART BEEN DRAINED BY WORKERS TEMPORARILY LAID OFF WHEN PLANTS WERE CLOSED DOWN FOR RETOOLING
484c040q HERE ARE PRICE TRENDS ON THE WORLD'S MAJOR STOCK MARKETS AS CALCULATED BY MORGAN STANLEY CAPITAL INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE GENEVA
484c040r TO MAKE THEM DIRECTLY COMPARABLE EACH INDEX IS BASED ON THE CLOSE OF NINETEEN SIXTY NINE EQUALING ONE HUNDRED
484c040s THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE IS SINCE YEAR END
484c040t WE WANT MORE INSTITUTIONAL ASSETS SAYS A KEMPER SPOKESWOMAN
484c040u WE THINK THE BUSINESS HOLDS CONSIDERABLE PROMISE FOR THE FUTURE SHE ADDS AND WE THINK CITICORP IS A CAPABLE ORGANIZATION
484c040v OTHERS SAY INSTITUTIONAL ASSET MANAGEMENT STILL IS CONSIDERED A GOOD BUSINESS DESPITE RELATIVELY LOW FEES AND SIGNS OF SLOWING GROWTH
484c040w FIRST BOSTON AND XEROX HAD NO COMMENT
484c040x THE CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER WOULD HAVE BOTH THE FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL BUSINESSES REPORTING TO HIM
484c040y MR. SHELTON HAD LED AN IMPROVED PERFORMANCE OF THE LATTER DURING THE PAST TWO YEARS
484c040z HE ALSO HAS A LONGER TERM RELATIONSHIP WITH COMPANY CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER WILLIAM S. WIRE THE SECOND WORKING FOR GENESCO SINCE NINETEEN FIFTY SIX
484c0410 FARM FUTURES PRICES HAVE FALLEN SEVERAL TIMES IN THE PAST TWO WEEKS FOLLOWING SEVERAL WEEKS OF A DROUGHT INSPIRED RALLY
484c0411 YESTERDAY'S TRADING SEEMED TO SUPPORT THE NOTION AMONG SOME ANALYSTS THAT CORN AND WHEAT FUTURES ARE TOP HEAVY
484c0412 THE MARKET HAS BEEN OVERDONE SIGNIFICANTLY ON THE UPSIDE SAID RICHARD LOEWY SENIOR GRAIN AND OIL SEED ANALYST WITH PRUDENTIAL BACHE SECURITIES INCORPORATED
484c0413 THE PIPER HAS TO BE PAID ON THE OTHER SIDE
484c0414 ONE OF THE FOUR BUSINESSES INCLUDED IN THE LOCKUP OPTION GRANTED TO K. K. R. IS MACMILLAN'S DIRECTORY DIVISION WHICH CONSISTS OF WHO'S WHO AND NATIONAL REGISTER PUBLISHING
484c0415 THUS IT WASN'T IMMEDIATELY CLEAR WHY INTERNATIONAL THOMSON MIGHT BE LOOKING AT THE OPERATION EVEN THOUGH IT IS INCLUDED IN THE LOCKUP OPTION
484c0416 <NOISE> A SPOKESMAN FOR K. K. R. ALSO DECLINED COMMENT
484c0417 THE DECISION FREES INTERIOR OFFICIALS TO FORMALLY OPEN OIL COMPANY BIDS TO LEASE UP TO FIVE POINT SIX MILLION ACRES IN A SALMON RICH AREA NEAR THE BERING SEA
484c0418 THE GOVERNMENT SOLICITED BIDS FOR THE SALE IN JANUARY NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX BUT UNTIL NOW HAS BEEN BARRED BY COURT ORDER FROM OPENING THEM
484c0419 OFFICIALS SAID THE BIDS WOULD BE OPENED IN AL- ANCHORAGE ALASKA TUESDAY
484c041a TO BE SURE ON A LOT OF SCORES THE SUMMIT WAS A GREAT SUCCESS
484c041b ECONOMIC COOPERATION WAS ADVANCED WITH BUSINESSMEN SIGNING AGREEMENTS FOR ABOUT THIRTY CONTRACTS AND SEVERAL JOINT VENTURES
484c041c HUMAN RIGHTS TOO MAY HAVE TAKEN A STEP FORWARD IF MR. GORBACHEV LIVES UP TO HIS PROMISE TO RELEASE ALL POLITICAL PRISONERS BY YEAR'S END
484c041d IN EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT THE POLITICAL SETTLEMENT ENVISAGED BY THE NON COMMUNISTS SEEMED PLAUSIBLE
484c041e SOVIET LEADER MIKHAIL GORBACHEV WAS A MAJOR REASON
484c041f MR. GORBACHEV SAW THE EXPANSIONIST AMBITIONS OF HIS PREDECESSORS STYMIED BY THE RESOLUTE CONTAINMENT POLICY OF BOTH CHINA AND THE PRO WESTERN ASEAN POWERS
484c041g SUPPORT FOR THE VIETNAMESE OCCUPATION OF CAMBODIA COST THE SOVIET UNION ECONOMICALLY AND DIPLOMATICALLY
484c041h <NOISE> SO THE SOVIETS TRYING TO ELIMINATE THE MILITARY QUAGMIRE IN CAMBODIA PERSUADED HANOI'S LEADERS TO NEGOTIATE A MILITARY WITHDRAWAL FROM CAMBODIA
485c0201 LAST WEEK THERE WERE REPORTS THAT AFTER OFFERING SHEARSON LEHMAN HAD A BIG UNSOLD CHUNK OF STOCK
485c0202 IN A NARROWLY DRAWN STATEMENT VICE CHAIRMAN HERBERT FREIMAN DENIED SHEARSON HAD OFFERED A BLOCK TO SALOMON BROTHERS WHICH MANAGED THE SELLING BROKERS' FLOOR OPERATION
485c0203 MR. FREIMAN WOULDN'T ELABORATE
485c0204 THE SWISS FRANC BOND MARKET MEANWHILE REMAINED LISTLESS DESPITE A SHARP FALL IN THE DOLLAR
485c0205 <NOISE> MOST PRICES WERE UNCHANGED WITH AVERAGE TURNOVER TRADERS SAID
485c0206 ONE GENEVA TRADER SAID INVESTORS WERE STAYING OUT OF THE MARKET BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE THE BOTTOM IS IN THE DOLLAR'S CURRENT DECLINE
485c0207 CLOSELY HELD TRANSAMERICAN SAID IT ALSO AGREED TO SETTLE A DISPUTE WITH ANOTHER CREDITOR MEDALLION OIL COMPANY
485c0208 THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENTS WHICH MUST BE APPROVED BY THE BANKRUPTCY COURT WOULD REMOVE TWO MAJOR HURDLES IN TRANSAMERICAN'S LONG STRUGGLE TO GET OUT OF CHAPTER ELEVEN PROCEEDINGS
485c0209 TRANSAMERICAN FILED FOR COURT PROTECTION FROM CREDITORS IN JANUARY NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE WHEN IT WAS MIRED IN ONE POINT TWO MILLION OF DEBT
485c020a <NOISE> I RECEIVED WELFARE FOR EIGHT MONTHS AFTER MY SECOND CHILD WAS BORN
485c020b LUCKILY I WAS ABLE WITH THE HELP OF MY FAMILY TO GET A GOOD JOB AND RELIABLE CHILD CARE
485c020c BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF WELFARE MOTHERS OUT THERE WHO AREN'T THIS FORTUNATE
485c020d A LOT OF WOMEN DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET JOBS OR THE TRAINING NEEDED TO GET ONE AND SOMEONE TO WATCH THEIR CHILDREN
485c020e WHEN THAT SITUATION IS RESOLVED THEN YOU WILL SEE A LOT OF FORMER WELFARE RECIPIENTS BECOMING PRODUCTIVE MEMBERS OF SOCIETY
485c020f THE SUN BELT FORECAST PARTLY CLOUDY
485c020g ECONOMISTS EXPECT THE SOUTHEAST BUFFERED BY ITS BIG SERVICE ECONOMY TO CONTINUE TO OUTPERFORM THE NATION
485c020h BUT SOME OVERBUILT REAL ESTATE MARKETS COULD GET BASHED AND FLORIDA'S INFLUX OF RETIREES JOB SEEKERS AND TOURISTS COULD DWINDLE
485c020i <NOISE> THE SHAREHOLDER DAVID F. LAROCHE A PROVIDENCE RHODE ISLAND INVESTOR FILED THE SUIT IN A STATE SUPERIOR COURT IN NEWPORT

485c020k A SUPERIOR COURT JUDGE DECLINED TO ISSUE A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER REQUESTED BY THE SUIT TO BLOCK THE ACQUISITION SAID A COURT CLERK
485c020l IN ADDITION LAURENTIAN SAID BERNHARD M. KOCH THIRTY THREE WAS NAMED VICE PRESIDENT AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER
485c020m HE SUCCEEDS JOHN STROM WHO TRANSFERRED TO A LAURENTIAN CAPITAL UNIT

485c020r HOW SERIOUS AND PATIENT INVESTOR INTEREST IS WILL BE TESTED NEXT MONTH
485c020s A GOVERNMENT OWNED INSURANCE AGENCY IS SET TO AUCTION OFF THE HYATT REGENCY MANILA
485c020t THE AGENCY HOPES TO REALIZE ITS TARGET PRICE OF THIRTEEN MILLION
485c020u THUS INSTEAD OF CALMAT'S BEING ACQUIRED SELECT ASSETS WOULD BE OPTIONED AND A HUNK OF STOCK WOULD BE IN RELATIVELY SAFE HANDS
485c020v CALMAT WOULD BE RE- !RID OF MR. BRIERLEY WHO APPEARS TO HAVE TRIED TO PUT THE COMPANY IN PLAY
485c020w INDUSTRIAL EQUITY EXECUTIVES IN CALIFORNIA DIDN'T RETURN CALLS SEEKING COMMENT
485c020x MR. CHATICHAI'S WEALTHY FAMILY BACKGROUND AND HIS FAMILY'S LARGE PROPERTY INTERESTS GIVE HIM A GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY
485c020y FURTHER HE HAS GOOD RELATIONS WITH THE LARGE ETHNIC CHINESE COMMUNITY AND SERVES AS CHAIRMAN OF THE THAI CHINESE FRIENDSHIP ASSOCIATION
485c020z THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE COUNTRY'S BUSINESS ELITE MANY OF WHOM ARE ETHNIC CHINESE
485c0210 HOWEVER CONVENTIONAL FILM WILL BE MARGINALLY PROFITABLE AT BEST FOR POLAROID BECAUSE INITIALLY POLAROID WON'T BE MANUFACTURING THE FILM CONTENDS ELLIOTT NOVAK AN INDUSTRY CONSULTANT
485c0211 INSTEAD IT WILL BUY THE FILM FROM ANOTHER COMPANY AND PUT ITS NAME ON IT JUST AS IT DOES WITH VIDEOTAPE
485c0212 SINCE IT BEGAN SELLING VIDEOTAPE A FEW YEARS AGO POLAROID HAS BUILT UP AN IMPRESSIVE TWELVE PERCENT MARKET SHARE MAKING IT THE LEADER IN THE U. S.
485c0213 BUT FIERCE COMPETITION HAS KEPT VIDEOTAPE PROFITS SLIM AND THE CONVENTIONAL FILM BUSINESS ISN'T LIKELY TO PROVE ANY BONANZA EITHER
485c0214 PETER DAPUZZO HEAD OF RETAIL TRADING AT SHEARSON LEHMAN HUTTON ALSO LOOKS FOR A SHARP UPWARD MOVE IN STOCK PRICES GIVEN A FEW IFS
485c0215 ONE IS IF INVESTORS DON'T GET SPOOKED AT THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE CRASH
485c0216 ANOTHER IS IF THE FEDERAL RESERVE EASES INTEREST RATES
485c0217 AND A THIRD IS IF GEORGE BUSH WINS THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION
485c0218 I DON'T KNOW IF THE PARENTS UNDERSTAND HOW SUBTLE THIS NEW AGE MOVEMENT REALLY IS SHE SAYS
485c0219 THEY DRAW THE KIDS IN WITH FAIRY TALES AND SORCERY
485c021a THEIR ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO DO AWAY WITH ANYBODY WHO BELIEVES THERE'S SUCH A THING AS EVIL
485c021b BUT YAMAICHI DENIED THE RUMORS
485c021c THIS MAKES A DOZEN CALLS I'VE HAD ON THIS TODAY SAID AN ANNOYED TRADING OFFICIAL AT YAMAICHI'S NEW YORK BASED U. S. SUBSIDIARY
485c021d HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE FIRM ACTIVELY SOLD S. AND P. FIVE HUNDRED FUTURES LAST WEEK AND THAT DEAN WITTER HANDLED SOME OF THE SALES
485c021e BUT HE ADDED THAT WE HAVEN'T HAD A HEAVY SELLER AT ALL THIS WEEK
485c0301 THE BROADCASTING PROPERTIES HAVE LONG BEEN REGARDED AS GENCORP'S BEST DEFENSE AGAINST A HOSTILE TAKEOVER
485c0302 LICENSES FOR TWO OF THE TELEVISION STATIONS AND ALL THE RADIO STATIONS ARE BEING CHALLENGED BY GROUPS WHO CHARGE THAT GENCORP IS N- AN UNFIT OPERATOR
485c0303 THE DISPUTE INCLUDES ALLEGATIONS THAT GENCORP FAILED TO ADEQUATELY INFORM THE F. C. C. OF ALLEGEDLY IMPROPER CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS AND FOREIGN PAYMENTS
485c0304 THE NEW TAX LAW'S LIMITS ON RETIREMENT BENEFITS FOR EXECUTIVES SPUR GREATER INTEREST IN CERTAIN TRUSTS THAT HELP SAFEGUARD DEFERRED COMPENSATION UNTIL RETIREMENT TIME
485c0305 SUCH TRUSTS AREN'T COMPLETELY INVIOLATE CREDITORS CAN CLAIM THE MONEY AFTER A BANKRUPTCY FOR INSTANCE
485c0306 BUT THEY ARE CONSIDERED BETTER THAN A MERE PROMISE TO THE EXECUTIVE
485c0307 J. W. T. HADN'T YET RESPONDED TO W. P. P.'S WEDNESDAY BID OF FORTY FIVE DOLLARS A SHARE OR ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY MILLION
485c0308 ON FRIDAY W. P. P. LAUNCHED A HOSTILE FORTY FIVE DOLLAR A SHARE TENDER OFFER FOR J. W. T.'S APPROXIMATELY TEN MILLION SHARES OUTSTANDING
485c0309 THAT HOSTILE OFFER FORMALLY REMAINED IN EFFECT DESPITE W. P. P.'S LATEST MOVE
485c030a AT A MEETING WITH ANALYSTS ROBERT M. KAVNER A. T. AND T.'S CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER SAID IT APPEARS WE WILL HAVE A GOOD YEAR
485c030b BUT IN RESPONSE TO AN ANALYST'S QUESTION HE SAID EARNINGS OF TWO DOLLARS A SHARE SOUNDS STRONG
485c030c HE ALSO WARNED ANALYSTS AGAINST LOOKING FOR A PARTICULAR QUARTER AND ISOLATING IT ADDING WE ARE LOOKING FOR THE ANNUAL TREND LINE
485c030d THERE'S SOME PAPER OUT FOR BIDS YOU HAVEN'T HEARD ABOUT CADWALLADER BECAUSE YOU DO ONLY DOMESTIC
485c030e COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT BONDS WITH THE COUPON INDEXED TO THE STREET PRICE OF COCAINE
485c030f SOLID INVESTMENT BUT INTRIGUING
485c030g I THINK WE'RE GOING TO SPRING FOR THAT
485c030h WITH A REBOUND IN THE STOCK MARKET INVESTORS' FEARS ABOUT A RECESSION COOLED AND THE BOND MARKET SLUMPED
485c030i A SHARP SLIDE IN THE U. S. DOLLAR ALSO ADDED SOME DOWNWARD PRESSURE TO BOND PRICES
485c030j DESPITE THE DECLINE IN BONDS THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM STILL CONTINUED TO MAKE GOOD ON ITS PROMISE TO PROVIDE AMPLE *LIQUIDITY* THROUGHOUT ITS OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS
485c030k DESPITE ALL THE UNCERTAINTY THAT SURROUNDED BRITISH PETROLEUM'S JUMBO OFFERING THERE WASN'T THAT MUCH TURMOIL IN THE MARKET WHEN SHARES BEGAN TO TRADE FRIDAY
485c030l B. P.'S PARTIALLY PAID AMERICAN DEPOSITARY SHARES DEC- CLOSED UNCHANGED AT SEVENTEEN AND A QUARTER WITH THIRTEEN POINT TWO MILLION TRADED
485c030m IT WAS THE BIG BOARD'S MOST ACTIVE ISSUE
485c030n UNTIL NOW NASDAQ OR THE N. A. S. D.'S AUTOMATED QUOTATION SYSTEM HAS PROVIDED COMPUTER TERMINALS WITH PRICE QUOTATIONS ON ALL ISSUES
485c030o MOST BIG TRADES HOWEVER ARE NEGOTIATED BY TELEPHONE AND THEN RECORDED INTO THE SYSTEM'S COMPUTERS
485c030p ONLY THE SMALL ORDER SYSTEM HAS PROVIDED TRADERS WITH THE ABILITY TO EXECUTE TRADES BY COMPUTER RATHER THAN BY TELEPHONE
485c030q STILL COMPANY INSIDERS SAID THE RESTRUCTURING WAS ENTIRELY MR. AKERS'S PLANS AND WASN'T FORCED ON HIM BY THE I. B. M. BOARD
485c030r A DIRECTOR SAID THE BOARD LEARNED OF THE PLAN AT ITS MEETING LAST TUESDAY
485c030s JOHN FOUND EVERYTHING WAS COMING ONTO HIS DESK AND HE HAD MORE THAN HE COULD COPE WITH ANOTHER DIRECTOR SAID

485c030u THE E. P. A. PROPOSED MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR FOR MUNICIPAL TRASH DUMPS THAT THE AGENCY ESTIMATED WILL COST EIGHT HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SEVEN MILLION A YEAR
485c030v THE PROPOSED RULES WOULD REQUIRE ABOUT SIX THOUSAND DUMPS TO INSTALL GROUNDWATER MONITORING SYSTEMS
485c030w THEY WOULD ALSO CLOSE SOME DUMPS AND PUT SPECIAL CONDITIONS ON OTHERS IN CERTAIN AREAS
485c030x HOPING TO PREVENT LONG COSTLY DISPUTES OVER WHAT DOCUMENTS DEFENDANTS HAVE TO SURRENDER JUDGES GRANT BLANKET PROTECTIVE ORDERS
485c030y THE ORDERS TYPICALLY BAR PUBLIC DISSEMINATION OF RECORDS AND DEP- DEPOSITIONS EVEN AFTER A SETTLEMENT OR VERDICT

485c0311 THE TWO DIVISIONS TOGETHER ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT EIGHTY MILLION TO NINETY MILLION IN ANNUAL SALES SAID ROBERT L. BERNSTEIN RANDOM HOUSE CHAIRMAN
485c0312 MR. BERNSTEIN NOTED THAT RANDOM HOUSE HAS EXPANDED IN OTHER DIRECTIONS NOTABLY IN TRADE PUBLISHING
485c0313 TRADE BOOKS ARE ALL BOOKS SOLD DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS IN BOOK STORES AND THROUGH MAIL ORDERS
485c0314 A. YES WITHOUT QUESTION
485c0315 IT'S MY SENSE THAT THERE WAS A TIME WHEN PEOPLE THOUGHT THEY COULD TRADE ON INSIDE INFORMATION WITH ABSOLUTE IMPUNITY
485c0316 AND THAT'S NO LONGER TRUE
485c0317 NOW I AM CERTAIN THAT THERE ARE STILL PEOPLE WHO THINK THEY CAN TRADE ON INSIDE INFORMATION AND GET AWAY WITH IT BECAUSE THEY'RE SMARTER THAN THE AVERAGE PERSON
485c0318 THERE WILL ALWAYS BE THOSE PEOPLE
485c0319 BUT I THINK THAT THE ACTIONS HAVE HAD A *SIGNIFICANT* EFFECT ON CONDUCT
485c031a THIS GROWING RELIANCE ON THIRD PARTIES TO SELL PRODUCTS COULD HINDER HEWLETT PACKARD'S ABILITY TO MANAGE ITS BUSINESS AND MAKE THE COMPANY'S STOCK LESS ATTRACTIVE TO INVESTORS
485c031b YOU BOUGHT H. P. STOCK IN THE PAST BECAUSE IT HAD MORE CONTROL OVER ITS DESTINY THAN OTHER ELECTRONICS FIRMS MR. WU SAID

485c0401 THE WORD IS TERROR
485c0402 MY FEAR OF FAILURE MAY BE GREATER IN SOME RESPECTS
485c0403 PEOPLE SAY ADVERSITY IS GOOD FOR YOU
485c0404 WELL THAT'S NOT EXACTLY TRUE
485c0405 I'M NOT THE SAME PERSON I WAS
485c0406 TRADING VOLUME HAS BEEN LETHARGIC FOR THE PAST FEW WEEKS PARTLY REFLECTING CONFUSION ABOUT THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK
485c0407 *IMPORTANT* CLUES ARE EXPECTED TO EMERGE FRIDAY WHEN THE LABOR DEPARTMENT REPORTS EMPLOYMENT FIGURES FOR FEBRUARY
485c0408 MANY ANALYSTS EXPECT THE STATISTICS TO INDICATE THAT THE ECONOMY REMAINS WEAK AND THAT LOWER INTEREST RATES LIE AHEAD
485c0409 BUT THE EMPLOYMENT STATISTICS ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO PREDICT AND INDIVIDUAL ESTIMATES VARY WIDELY
485c040a BUT SOME INDUSTRY ANALYSTS ARE SKEPTICAL ABOUT S. H. V.'S INTENTIONS
485c040b THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON THERE SAID HUMPHREY HARRISON AN ANALYST AT COUNTY SECURITIES
485c040c I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE END GAME IS BUT I DOUBT THEY S. H. V. WILL REMAIN AT TWENTY EIGHT PERCENT
485c040d MR. REINHARD REMEMBERS AN INDIAN COMMERCIAL TWO YEARS A- AGO AT THE PRESTIGIOUS CANNES FESTIVAL NO RELATION TO THE FILM FESTIVAL THERE
485c040e IT SHOWED A CLOSE UP OF A FLATULENT ELEPHANT'S BACKSIDE WHILE AN ANNOUNCER EXPLAINED THE SOUND IN PLAIN LANGUAGE

485c040j THOUGH THE FILING COMPLICATES THE BATTLE MOST EXPERTS BELIEVE NEITHER COMPANY WILL EMERGE THE WINNER

485c040q LOCAL NEWSPAPERS YESTERDAY SAID THE GOVERNMENT MAY QUALIFY THE DECISION TO SIGN THE RESTRUCTURING AGREEMENT

485c040v BUT AT LEAST THE MARKET DIDN'T CRASH
485c040w NO FINAL BUDGET DECISIONS HAVE BEEN MADE AT THE WHITE HOUSE
485c040x BUDGET DRAFTING IS BEHIND SCHEDULE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES WON'T EVEN SEE O. M. B. RE- RECOMMENDATIONS UNTIL LATE THIS WEEK
485c040y BUT IT'S ALREADY CLEAR THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS INCREASED ITS EMPHASIS ON EDUCATION
485c040z I THINK IT'S A PERFECTLY HONORABLE PROFESSION
485c0410 IF MORE OF US DID IT THE OPPORTUNITIES WOULD GET SMALLER BECAUSE MORE FIRMS WOULD BE COMPETING TO CLOSE THE SAME SPREADS HE SAYS
485c0411 THE PRODUCT IS A *LEGITIMATE* HEDGING PRODUCT AND A LEGITIMATE WAY TO ADD LIQUIDITY TO TH- THE MARKET
485c0412 REAL ESTATE INDUSTRY SOURCES SAID INTENSE FRICTION BETWEEN SALVATORE RANIERI AND MR. DAVIS DEVELOPED DURING THE KIAWAH NEGOTIATIONS
485c0413 SALVATORE RANIERI DIDN'T RETURN A REPORTER'S TELEPHONE CALL
485c0414 A SPOKESMAN FOR MR. DAVIS DIDN'T DISPUTE THE REPORT OF PERSONAL FRICTION
485c0415 BANKS THAT COMMIT TO THE NEW CREDIT BY TODAY GET A FEE EQUAL TO POINT THREE SEVEN FIVE PERCENT OF THE AMOUNT THEY COMMIT
485c0416 IT WON'T BE CLEAR UNTIL AFTER THE WEEKEND HOW MANY COMMITMENTS HAVE BEEN RECEIVED
485c0417 BUT SOME BANKERS CLOSE TO THE TRANSACTION ESTIMATE THAT ABOUT EIGHTY PERCENT OR SLIGHTLY MORE THAN FOUR BILLION WOULD BE COMMITTED BY EARLY NEXT WEEK
485c0418 MR. LENNANE HAD STARTED THE BIDDING IN JUNE BY PROPOSING TO TAKE THE COMPANY PRIVATE FOR SEVEN POINT TWO FIVE DOLLARS A SHARE

486c0203 A THIRD PALO VERDE UNIT IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION
486c0204 CARVING UP THE BOESKY FUND WOULD EFFECTIVELY END MR. BOESKY'S INVOLVEMENT IN THE SECURITIES BUSINESS
486c0205 MR. BOESKY FORMALLY HAS UNTIL APRIL FIRST NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT TO WIND UP HIS AFFAIRS UNDER AN AGREEMENT WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
486c0206 BUT THE BOESKY FUND HAS ALREADY SOLD NEARLY ALL ITS STOCK POSITIONS AND A QUICKER DISSOLUTION HAS APPEARED LIKELY FOR SOME TIME
486c0207 IT'S INCONCEIVABLE THAT THE DIRECTORATE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT MR. RODRIGUEZ COMMENTS ONE INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS WORKER WHO HAS STUDIED THE LOCAL REFUGEE SITUATION
486c0208 THE PEOPLE OF EL BARILLO ARE UNDER THE BOOT

486c020k THEY POINT TO RECENT INCREASES IN THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE WHICH IS THE RATE ON RESERVES THAT BANKS LEND EACH OTHER OVERNIGHT
486c020l THE FUNDS RATE AVERAGED ABOUT SEVEN AND FIVE EIGHTHS PERCENT YESTERDAY AND TUESDAY UP FROM AN AVERAGE OF SEVEN POINT FORTY THREE PERCENT IN THE WEEK ENDED OCTOBER SEVENTH
486c020m THESE ANALYSTS ARGUE THAT THE INCREASE WAS ENGINEERED BY THE FED
486c020n NEARLY ALL THE GAINERS WERE COMPANIES THAT SELL TO CUSTOMERS OTHER THAN PERSONAL COMPUTER MAKERS
486c020o INTEL THE BIGGEST O. T. C. SEMICONDUCTOR MAKER AND BY FAR THE LARGEST ELECTRONICS ISSUE ON NASDAQ FELL ONE QUARTER TO TWENTY THREE AND THREE QUARTERS
486c020p L. S. I. LOGIC ANOTHER BIG SEMICONDUCTOR CONCERN WITH SOME P. C. MAKING CUSTOMERS WAS UNCHANGED AT SEVEN AND THREE QUARTERS

486c020z WE GO THROUGH THESE CYCLES SAYS JOHN WATSON PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL SECURITY TRADERS ASSOCIATION MOST OF WHOSE MEMBERS ARE O. T. C. BROKERS
486c0210 THERE ARE CERTAIN TIMES CONDUCIVE TO BRINGING OUT NEW OFFERINGS
486c0211 FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S THE BAFFLING CASE OF A YOUNG CHILD WHO SIMPLY STOPPED GROWING FOR A YEAR AND A HALF
486c0212 DOCTORS COULDN'T IDENTIFY A MEDICAL REASON
486c0213 THE TENTATIVE DIAGNOSIS HERE STRESS
486c0214 SENSING THE FAMILY AS WHOLE UNDER PRESSURE THE CHILD HAD BECOME AN EMOTIONAL CARETAKER TO THE PARENTS

486c0219 OVER THE COUNTER DRUGS SUCH AS WARNER LAMBERT'S LISTERINE MOUTHWASH ARE THOUGHT TO HAVE FRANCHISE VALUE
486c021a THEY AREN'T RESEARCH INTENSIVE THEY'RE MARKETING INTENSIVE ONE ANALYST SAID
486c021b TODAY COLOMBIANS WHO HAVE STOOD UP OVERTLY TO THE COCAINE GANGS REMAIN A MINORITY
486c021c NOTABLE AMONG THEM IS JUSTICE MINISTER MONICA DE GREIFF
486c021d SHE HAS INTENSIFIED THE BATTLE AGAINST DRUG DEALERS DESPITE THEIR THREAT OF TOTAL WAR AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT IF THE CURRENT NARCOTICS CONTROL DRIVE CONTINUES
486c021e LIKE MS. DE GREIFF SOME JUDGES HAVE DEFIED THE GANGSTERS
486c021f MORE THAN A DOZEN JUSTICE DEPARTMENT FUNCTIONARIES HAVE BEEN KILLED THIS YEAR
486c021g THEY INCLUDE HELENA DIAZ THE MEDELLIN JUDGE WHO IN JULY REFUSED TO REVOKE ARREST WARRANTS ISSUED FOR REPUTED MEDELLIN CARTEL BOSSES
486c0301 THE COMPUTER CAN ALSO DISPLAY A PATTERN SHOWING HOW PEOPLE NORMALLY PLACE THE TONGUE TO PRODUCE SAY AN S. SOUND
486c0302 A DEAF PERSON CAN THEN TRY TO MATCH THE PATTERN BY PLACING THE TONGUE AGAINST THE ELECTRONIC PALATE
486c0303 WITH CAREFUL COACHING AND TRIAL AND ERROR CHILDREN LIKE MISS GILROY CAN LEARN HOW TO MAKE SOUNDS THAT REQUIRE PLACING THE TONGUE AGAINST THE ROOF OF THE MOUTH
486c0304 THE BUNDESBANK HAS REFUSED ANY FURTHER ACTION
486c0305 THESE DAYS IT'S POSSIBLE TO PICK UP THE PAPERS AND READ ABOUT WEST GERMAN FEARS OF REIGNITING INFLATION
486c0306 YOU HAVE TO PINCH YOURSELF TO REMEMBER THAT THE INFLATION RUNNING NEAR ZERO IN APRIL IS NOW RUNNING BELOW ZERO
486c0307 THE E. M. S. APPARENTLY MUST NOW BE REALIGNED AND THE FRANC DEVALUED TO ACCOMMODATE THE GERMAN TASTE FOR DEFLATION
486c0308 BUT THE TRADE FIGURES COULD BE AN EVEN MORE IMPORTANT INFLUENCE ON INTEREST RATES MANY ANALYSTS SAY
486c0309 IF THE JANUARY DEFICIT TURNS OUT TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER THAN THE APPROXIMATELY FOURTEEN BILLION DOLLAR GAP THAT MANY ANALYSTS EXPECT THE DOLLAR MIGHT RESUME ITS FALL
486c030a THAT COULD ALARM FOREIGN INVESTORS AND DISCOURAGE THEM FROM ADDING TO THEIR HOLDINGS OF DOLLAR DENOMINATED INVESTMENTS
486c030b THERE'S BEEN A COMPLETE TURNAROUND IN SHORT TERM SENTIMENT SAID THOMAS G. GRIBBON A SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT AT NOMURA SECURITIES INTERNATIONAL INCORPORATED
486c030c "QUOTE FOR WEEKS PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TRADING BEARISHLY ON DOLLAR WEAKNESS AND A RISE IN THE C. R. B. INDEX "UNQUOTE

486c030k SOURCES SAID THAT IN THE CONTRACT TALKS BEING HELD IN LONDON IRAQI MARKETING OFFICIALS ARE INSISTING THAT TWO MAJOR OIL COMPANIES ALREADY HAVE SIGNED

486c0310 IT HAS REFUSED REQUESTS TO SEE HIM FROM BOTH HIS FAMILY AND HIS LAWYER
486c0311 BUT U. S. MANUFACTURERS WHO TOOK A BEATING DURING THE FIRST HALF OF THIS DECADE CONTINUE TO ENJOY A ROARING REVIVAL THAT BEGAN LAST YEAR
486c0312 AS A RESULT THERE IS GROWING EVIDENCE THAT FACTORY WAGE AND PRICE INCREASES ARE ACCELERATING
486c0313 AND THAT COULD LEAD THE FED TO BOOST INTEREST RATES IN AN EFFORT TO COOL DOWN THE ECONOMY IN THE COMING MONTHS
486c0314 ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE GENERAL STRIKE FACTORIES CLOSED BUT BOOKSTORES REMAINED OPEN IN THIS OLD WORLD CULTURAL CENTER
486c0315 MOST SCHOOLS WERE SHUT BUT PUSHKIN STREET NEAR THE SQUARE REVERBERATED AS USUAL WITH THE SOUND OF BADLY PLAYED CHOPIN EMANATING FROM THE OPEN WINDOWS OF THE MUSIC ACADEMY

486c0318 THEIR POLITICAL DEMANDS INCLUDE CALLS FOR A SEPARATE ARMY BRIGADE AND THE RIGHT FOR ARMENIA TO HAVE CONSULATES ABROAD
486c0319 OVERALL CONSUMER SPENDING HAS SLOWED DOWN SINCE LAST YEAR'S STOCK MARKET CRASH BUT IT'S STILL AT A LEVEL THAT WORRIES SOME ECONOMISTS
486c031a CONSUMER CREDIT SLOWED SHARPLY IN JULY REFLECTING SLUGGISH SALES
486c031b TOO MUCH SPENDING AT HOME COUPLED WITH HEAVY DEMAND FOR EXPORTS COULD OVERLOAD AN INDUSTRIAL SECTOR THAT IS ALREADY RUNNING NEAR CAPACITY

48bc031c WAGES AND BONUSES ROSE NINETEEN PERCENT IN THE FIRST HALF A RATE THAT FAR OUTPACED ECONOMIC GROWTH AND EXERTED UPWARD PRESSURE ON PRICES
48bc031d CHINA'S ECONOMY GREW AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF FIVE POINT SEVEN PERCENT IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS ROUGHLY HALF THE AVERAGE ANNUAL RATE IN THE PAST DECADE
48bc0401 THE REPORT DOESN'T INCLUDE PRESIDENT REAGAN'S OWN VERSION OF EVENTS
48bc0402 DOES THE PRESIDENT HAVE A VERSION OF THE EVENTS
48bc0403 I DON'T KNOW IF HE DOES SAID MR. MATHES
48bc0404 HE SAID THE WHITE HOUSE WAS PLEASED THAT THE REPORT HAD BEEN RELEASED BECAUSE MR. REAGAN WANTS TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED
48bc0405 CAPTAIN OVERHEARING THE RADIO DISCUSSION ABOUT RUNWAY FIVE I UNDERSTOOD NOTHING
48bc0406 AND WHAT RUNWAY
48bc0407 WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
48bc0408 LAST MONTH'S SURGE WAS WIDESPREAD WITH AUTO SALES RISING ONE POINT NINE PERCENT BUILDING MATERIALS ONE POINT TWO PERCENT AND FURNITURE CLIMBING POINT SEVEN PERCENT
48bc0409 THE ONLY NOTICEABLE DECLINES WERE IN RESTAURANTS POINT SIX PERCENT AND FOOD STORES POINT THREE PERCENT
48bc040a EXCLUDING AUTOS SALES ROSE POINT FOUR PERCENT LAST MONTH
48bc040b <NOISE> IF WE LOOK AT THE RECORD THE DEBATE SHOULD BE RATHER SHORT
48bc040c THE WINNERS OBVIOUS
48bc040d THE ONLY TRAGEDY AND IT'S AN AMAZING ONE IS THAT MOST AMERICANS DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED AND HOW IT CAME ABOUT
48bc040e CHRISTIANS AND MOSLEMS MARCHED ACROSS BEIRUT'S SECT- SECTARIAN DEMARCATION LINE TO PROTEST LEBANON'S ECONOMIC CRISIS
48bc040f ABOUT TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE PARTICIPATED IN THE RALLY
48bc040g LEBANON'S CURRENCY HAS LOST ABOUT EIGHTY PERCENT AGAINST THE VALUE OF THE U. S. DOLLAR THIS YEAR AND THE INFLATION RATE IS ESTIMATED ABOUT THREE HUNDRED PERCENT
48bc040h PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT INFLATION MR. WORSECK CONTINUED
48bc040i THEY ARE CONCERNED WHETHER THE DOLLAR WILL GO INTO THE TANK AGAIN
48bc040j I DON'T THINK PEOPLE ARE OVERREACTING
48bc040k CHRYSLER IS RESUMING EXPORTS TO EUROPE AFTER ITS FINANCIAL PROBLEMS IN THE LATE NINETEEN SEVENTIES FORCED IT TO LEAVE THE MARKET
48bc040l THE COMPANY PLANS TO SHIP VERSIONS OF ITS DODGE SHADOW DODGE DAYTONA SHELBY Z. PLYMOUTH VOYAGER AND THE LEBARON SEDAN COUPE AND CONVERTIBLE
48bc040m <NOISE> THE CARS WILL BE F- WILL BE SOLD FIRST IN WEST GERMANY BELGIUM AUSTRIA THE NETHERLANDS AND SWITZERLAND
48bc040n THE ROAD NAMED WEST STREET IS A NARROW STRIP OF RED GRAVEL
48bc040o IT IS LIKE THE PROVERBIAL RAILROAD TRACKS IN AMERICA THAT SEPARATE THE RICH SIDE OF TOWN FROM THE POOR
48bc040p PHYSICAL DISTANCE MAY NOT BE GREAT BUT THE MENTAL GAP IS
48bc040q THE HONDURAN LEGISLATOR AGAIN I'M ALMOST CONVINCED THAT THE SANDINISTAS ARE GOING TO BE THERE FOREVER
48bc040r I THINK WE SHOULD GO INTO A PEACE PROCESS WITH THEM
48bc040s I DON'T SEE OURSELVES GOING INTO A WAR AND THE AMERICANS DON'T SEE THEMSELVES GOING INTO A VIETNAMA- VIETNAM TYPE WAR IN CENTRAL AMERICA
48bc040t SOME WONDER WHETHER ALL THE CONV- CONVERSIONS DON'T MAKE MR. BEREGOVOY MORE OF AN OPPORTUNIST THAN A BELIEVER IN MARKET ECONOMY
48bc040u BUT HIS AIDES SAY HE WAS CONVINCED HE WAS DOING THE RIGHT THING
48bc040v MR. BEREGOVOY SAID I'M NOT ASHAMED OF WHAT I DO
48bc040w THE PUBLIC FILINGS SHOW THAT A FIRM CALLED CAMRO ASSOCIATES ACQUIRED ONE PERCENT NONVOTING STAKE IN SEEME- SEEMALA IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR
48bc040x <NOISE> SEEMALA DISCLOSED THE CAMRO STAKE IN A PUBLIC S. E. C. FILING THAT YEAR SEEMALA DIDN'T IDENTIFY THE INVESTORS IN CAMRO
48bc040y <NOISE> <NOISE> BUT A SEPARATE NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR FILING BY CAMRO IN CALIFORNIA IDENTIFIES CAMRO AS A GENERAL PARTNERSHIP MADE UP OF MR. MILKEN AND TWENTY SIX OTHER DREXEL EMPLOYEES
48bc040z ROGER AILES THE MAN WHO WILL GUIDE GEORGE BUSH'S HEAVY MEDIA CAMPAIGN IS PUMPING UP HIS ANGER LIKE A LINEMAN PREPARING TO CRUSH THE OPPOSING QUARTERBACK
48bc0410 MICHAEL DUKAKIS HAS THE TOUGHEST KNEES AND ELBOWS TODAY SAID THE NEW YORK ADVERTISING EXECUTIVE WHO ONCE PITCHED NIXOR- RICHARD NIXON AS WARM
48bc0411 HE'S THE MEANEST LITTLE SON OF A BITCH I'VE EVER COME ACROSS IN POLITICS
48bc0412 MOANS STAN TRILLING A LONGTIME O. T. C. STOCKBROKER AT PAINEWEBBER IN IN LOS ANGELES IT'S LIKE I KNOW THERE'S A PARADE OUT THERE <NOISE>
48bc0413 I CAN HEAR THE BAND MARCHING BY
48bc0414 <NOISE> BUT THEY WON'T LET ME IN THE PARADE
48bc0415 THE OVERALL MARKET IS BEING DRIVEN BY THESE BIG CAP TAKEOVER STOCKS BUT I'M NOT PARTICIPATING
48bc0416 MR. TURNER MAY EVEN KNOW ALL THIS BECAUSE HIS PROTECTIONIST ARDOR IS QUITE RECENT
48bc0417 <NOISE> IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES HE WAS A GLOBALLY MINDED FINANCE MINISTER UNDER PIERRE TRU- TRUDEAU
48bc0418 <NOISE> LIBERALS LED A ROYAL COMMISSION THAT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE ENDORSED FREE TRADE AS THE BEST WAY FOR CANADA TO REACH ITS ECONOMIC POTENTIAL
48bc0419 LIKE RICHARD GEPHARDT AND SOME OTHER U. S. DEMOCRATS MR. TURNER MUST BELIEVE PROTECTIONISM IS A HOT BUTTON TO POLITICAL OFFICE
48bc041a <NOISE> INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR SMALL MEDICAL BILLS IS ESPECIALLY WASTEFUL
48bc041b USUALLY IT WILL COST AN INSURER MORE THAN FIFTY DOLLARS TO MONITOR EFFECTIVELY A FIFTY DOLLAR PHYSICIAN BILL THEREBY DOUBLING THE COST OF HEALTH INSURANCE
48bc041c FAILURE TO MONITOR ENCOURAGES PATIENTS AND DOCTORS TO MAKE WASTEFUL DECISIONS WITHOUT FEAR OF THIRD PARTY SCRUTINY
48bc041d EUROPE BY CONTRAST OFFERS A CORNUCOPIA OF UNDERVALUED CORPORATIONS AND A WAVE OF INDUSTRIAL RESTRUCTURING STEMMING FROM ITS DRIVE TOWARDS A SINGLE MARKET BY NINETEEN NINETY TWO
48bc041e IN SPAIN U. S. INVESTMENT BANKS TOOK A HUGE CHUNK OF THE RECENT BATCH OF BANK MERGERS
48bc041f SHEARSON HELPED ITALIAN FINANCIER CARLO DE BENEDETTI MAKE A PIONEERING ALBEIT UNSUCCESSFUL HOSTILE BID FOR THE GIANT BELGIAN HOLDING COMPANY <NOISE> SOCIETE GENERALE DE BELGIQUE LAST YEAR
48cc0201 THE OPERATING RATE IS STILL KIND OF LOW BUT IT'S COMING BACK SAID PRISCILLA LUCE SENIOR ECONOMIST AT WHARTON ECONOMETRIC FORECASTING ASSOCIATES IN PHILADELPHIA
48cc0202 THERE IS SOME CAUSE FOR OPTIMISM
48cc0203 SHE SAID EXPORT GAINS HAVE SPURRED SOME OF THE IMPROVEMENT
48cc0204 TEXAS STARTED EVALUATING POTENTIAL S. S. C. SITES ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO AND NOW HAS SOLID DATA ON SIX LOCATIONS SAYS DILLARD HAMMETT STATE ENERGY ADVISER
48cc0205 FOUR MORE COMMUNITIES HAVE SINCE ASKED TO BE INCLUDED
48cc0206 CONSIDERING THE STATE'S FLAT RELATIVELY EARTHQUAKE FREE LANDSCAPE MR. HAMMETT SAYS NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF TEXAS COULD HAVE THE SITE
48cc0207 THERE'S PROBABLY ALSO A PSYCHOLOGICAL SIDE TO AUGUSTA NATIONAL'S ACCENT ON EXPERIENCE
48cc0208 THE COLOR THAT'S SECOND ONLY TO GREEN HEREABOUTS IS GRAY
48cc0209 IT CAN BE FOUND MOSTLY ON THE HEADS OF PARTICIPANTS AND SPECTATORS
48cc020a GAINS FROM ASSET SALES COULD OFFSET THE BANK'S INCREASED LOAN LOSS PROVISIONS IN LATER QUARTERS
48cc020b MELLON'S INTERIM CHIEF EXECUTIVE NATHAN PEARSON TOLD SHAREHOLDERS AT THE BANK'S ANNUAL MEETING MONDAY THAT HE EXPECTS MELLON TO RETURN TO PROFITABILITY THIS YEAR
48cc020c BUT SEVERAL PROFITABLE MELLON BUSINESSES INCLUDING TRUST OPERATIONS AND DATA PROCESSING COULD BE SWAMPED BY CONTINUED LOSSES FROM ENERGY AND REAL ESTATE LOANS
48cc020d THIS YEAR THE SAME FORCES ARE AT WORK
48cc020e I BELIEVE THE CHANCES OF A REPEAT OF LAST YEAR'S PERFORMANCE ARE HIGH SAYS WILLIAM STERLING A MERRILL LYNCH ECONOMIST IN TOKYO
48cc020f <NOISE> HE EXPECTS TO SEE ONLY ABOUT SEVEN BILLION OF ADDITIONAL SPENDING NOT THE THIRTY SIX BILLION THAT MR. NAKASONE IS TALKING ABOUT
48cc020g IN A LETTER TO SUPPORTERS MR. NUNN SAID HIS POSITION AS CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE FORECLOSED A RUN FOR THE WHITE HOUSE
48cc020h <NOISE> IF I ATTEMPTED TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT AND ALSO CARRY OUT MY SENATE DUTIES I WOULD WIND UP DOING NEITHER WELL HE WROTE
48cc020i <NOISE> MR. NUNN ALSO EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT THE IMPACT OF A PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN ON MY FAMILY
48cc020j THE CONFRONTATION IN FEDERAL COURT MAY BREAK NEW GROUND IN BANKRUPTCY LAW
48cc020k OTHER COURTS NOTABLY THE ONE IN CHARGE OF THE MANVILLE CORPORATION CHAPTER ELEVEN PROCEEDINGS HAVE SET UP TRUST FUNDS TO PAY LARGE CLASSES OF INJURY VICTIMS
48cc020l BUT MANVILLE'S TWO POINT FIVE BILLION TO THREE BILLION DOLLAR TRUST INCLUDES PROVISIONS THAT ALLOW IT TO EXPAND IF FUNDS PROVE INADEQUATE TO PAY ASBESTOS RELATED CLAIMS
48cc020m SO FAR NO JUDGE HAS ATTEMPTED TO FIX AN ABSOLUTE CAP ON A GROUP OF CLAIMS AS HUGE AND UNCERTAIN AS THOSE FACING ROBINS
48cc020n ANOTHER REASON MR. SOIFER IS AVOIDING MORGAN AND CITICORP IS THAT THEIR STOCK PRICES AT TIMES HAVE TENDED TO GYRATE MORE VIOLENTLY THAN OTHER BANK ISSUES
48cc020o CITICORP AND MORGAN TEND TO HAVE MORE VOLATILITY ON DAYS WHEN PROGRAM TRADING IS KNOWN TO OCCUR MR. SOIFER SAYS
48cc020p THEY'RE MORE OF A BET ON WHICH WAY THE MARKET IS HEADED
48cc020q IN THE TWO SELECTED AREAS THE STATE WILL ALLOW PROCUREMENT AND RETAIL PRICES TO RISE TO WHAT THE OPEN MARKET DEMANDS
48cc020r THE SUBSIDY FOR CONSUMERS IS MEANT TO REDUCE THE STRAIN ON URBAN RESIDENTS
48cc020s FARMERS OF COURSE WILL GET HIGHER PRICES FOR THEIR GRAIN FROM THE MARKET WHICH IN TURN SHOULD INDUCE THEM TO INCREASE PRODUCTION
48cc020t GRAIN PRODUCTION THROUGHOUT CHINA HAS FALTERED IN RECENT YEARS IN PART BECAUSE STATE PROCUREMENT PRICES WERE TOO LOW
48cc020u <NOISE> NICARAGUA'S SANDINISTAS BLAMED A HARDLINE CONTRA FACTION LED BY MILITARY COMMANDER ENRIQUE BERMUDEZ FOR SLOWING PROGRESS IN FOUR DAYS OF PEACE TALKS THAT ENDED MONDAY IN MANAGUA

48cc020z AND OFFICIALS IN RICHMOND VIRGINIA AND DENVER ARE CONSIDERING CRACKING DOWN
48cc0210 WORLD BANK PRESIDENT BARBER CONABLE SAID THE BANK WILL SEND A DELEGATION TO ARGENTINA NEXT WEEK TO REVIEW THE MEASURES
48cc0211 IF THE BANK APPROVES THE DETAILS THE BRIDGE LOAN WOULD GO FORWARD AND THE WORLD BANK LOANS WOULD BE COMPLETED
48cc0212 A BANK SPOKESMAN SAID DETAILS OF THOSE LOANS WON'T BE KNOWN UNTIL THE DELEGATION COMPLETES ITS WORK
48cc0213 ESTIMATES OF THE MAKEUP OF THE FEEDLOT POPULATION VARY WIDELY
48cc0214 MOST ANALYSTS EXPECT THE GOVERNMENT TO REPORT THAT THE NUMBER OF YOUNG CATTLE PLACED ON FEEDLOTS FELL IN JULY FOR THE SECOND CONSECUTIVE MONTH FROM A YEAR EARLIER
48cc0215 HOWEVER SOME EXPECT A RISE
48cc0216 HE IS STRIKING NOW AT A TIME WHEN FINANCING FOR BIG DEALS IS READILY AVAILABLE AND THE STOCK PRICE IS DOWN
48cc0217 AS RECENTLY AS AUGUST R. J. R.'S STOCK WAS TRADING LOWER THAN ITS FORTY NINE DOLLAR LEVEL WHEN MR. JOHNSON TOOK OVER IN JANUARY NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
48cc0218 <NOISE> THE OFFER FOR A LEVERAGED BUY OUT PROBABLY WILL BE AT ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS A SHARE AND NOW OTHER TOBACCO STOCKS ARE SOARING TOO
48cc0219 <NOISE> IN THE PAST YEAR AND A HALF I. B. M. HAS BOUGHT PIECES OF NEARLY A DOZEN COMPANIES STEPPING UP THE PACE IN RECENT MONTHS

48cc021c <NOISE> INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR SMALL MEDICAL BILLS IS ESPECIALLY WASTEFUL
48cc021d USUALLY IT WILL COST AN INSURER MORE THAN FIFTY DOLLARS TO MONITOR EFFECTIVELY A FIFTY DOLLAR PHYSICIAN BILL THEREBY DOUBLING THE COST OF HEALTH INSURANCE
48cc021e BUT FAILURE TO MONITOR ENCOURAGES PATIENTS AND DOCTORS TO MAKE WASTEFUL DECISIONS WITHOUT FEAR OF THIRD PARTY SCRUTINY
48cc0301 IT'S INCONCEIVABLE THAT THE DIRECTORATE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT MR. RODRIGUEZ COMMENTS ONE INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS WORKER WHO HAS STUDIED THE LOCAL REFUGEE SITUATION
48cc0302 <NOISE> THE PEOPLE OF EL BARILLO ARE UNDER THE BOOT
48cc0303 <NOISE> THEY'VE BEEN SMART ENOUGH TO SURVIVE
48cc0304 THEY'VE ADAPTED
48cc0305 <NOISE> TO GET ITS MESSAGE TO MADISON AVENUE DECISION MAKERS WHITTLE COMMUNICATIONS HAS BEEN MA- RUNNING A SERIES OF SLICK ADS IN NEWSPAPERS AND MEDIA TRADE JOURNALS

48cc0307 THE POINT VIRTUALLY EVERY ADVERTISER IN EVERY MEDIUM IS PAYING TO REACH VIEWERS OR READERS WHO NEVER BECOME CUSTOMERS
48cc0308 <NOISE> NO OTHER LIKELY BIDDERS STEPPED FORWARD WEDNESDAY
48cc0309 HOSTILE TAKEOVERS ARE ALMOST UNHEARD OF IN THE DEFENSE INDUSTRY
48cc030a <NOISE> BUT ANALYSTS HAVE SPECULATED THAT EITHER FORD MOTOR COMPANY OR GENERAL ELECTRIC CORPORATION MIGHT BE A GOOD FIT WITH BOEING IF THE COMPANIES WERE INTERESTED
48cc030b FORD FOR INSTANCE HAS INDICATED IT IS LOOKING FOR ACQUISITIONS AND HAS ACCUMULATED ABOUT NINE BILLION DOLLARS IT COULD USE FOR SUCH PURPOSES
48cc030c A FORD SPOKESMAN CITING COMPANY POLICY WOULD NEITHER CONFIRM NOR DENY SPECULATION ABOUT ITS INTEREST
48cc030d G. E. DECLINED COMMENT BUT A SOURCE CLOSE TO THE COMPANY SAID IT ISN'T INTERESTED IN BOEING
48cc030e PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURER FIREMAN'S FUND HAS SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE MADE THREE UNFORESEEN ADDITIONS TO RESERVES FOR CLAIMS TOTALING MORE THAN ONE BILLION DOLLARS
48cc030f <NOISE> JOHN BYRNE FIREMAN'S CHAIRMAN SAYS HE'S CONFIDENT FIREMAN'S IS USING E- EXCESS RESOURCES TO RETIRE STOCK
48cc030g BUT HE CONCEDES BUY BACKS CAN BE RISKY FOR INSURERS
48cc030h <NOISE> ALSO BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANIES ARE CASH GUZZLERS CONSTANTLY NEEDING MONEY FOR CLINICAL TRIALS AND MANUFACTURING FACILITIES
48cc030i THE CRITICAL FACTOR FOR MOST COMPANIES ISN'T HOW MUCH CASH THEY HAVE BUT HOW IT'S BEING SPENT MR. MACCALLUM SAYS
48cc030j SOME COMPANIES THAT ARE SELLING AT CLOSE TO THEIR PRE PER SHARE CASH VALUES ARE CORRECTLY BEING PERCEIVED IN A SKEPTICAL LIGHT HE CONTENDS
48cc030k MR. SCHMIED IS BEING TESTED EARLY IN A POSITION HE DIDN'T SEEM EAGER TO OCCUPY
48cc030l ANALYSTS SAY HE IS AN OPERATIONS MAN WHO NEVER EXHIBITED ANY AMBITION TO BECOME CHIEF EXECUTIVE
48cc030m I NEVER GOT THE OVERWHELMING SENSE THAT HE WAS EAGER TO SUCCEED MR. FLAVIN SAYS CHRISTOPHER DEMISCH AN ANALYST AT FIRST BOSTON CORPORATION
48cc030n MOREOVER MR. SAWYER ISN'T THOUGHT TO POSSESS A LOT OF CLOUT
48cc030o <NOISE> HE DOESN'T FIT THE BOSS IMAGE THAT THE LATE MAYOR DALEY MADE FAMOUS AND THAT MAYOR WASHINGTON WAS BEGINNING TO ACQUIRE
48cc030p HE'S A WEAK GUY SAYS MR. ROSE THE POLITICAL CONSULTANT SUBJECT TO A LOT OF PRESSURE AND OBVIOUSLY NOT A CRUSADER
48cc030q ASKED HOW HE VIEWED THE PRUDENTIAL BACHE UNIT MR. WINTERS SAID ARE WE PLEASED WITH THEIR RESULTS
48cc030r OF COURSE NOT
48cc030s ARE WE PLEASED WITH THEIR DIRECTION
48cc030t YES
48cc030u MR. WINTERS ADDED THAT PRUDENTIAL BACHE MAY BE MORE DELIBERATE THIS YEAR IN SOME OF ITS EXPANSION
48cc030v HE ALSO VOICED CONFIDENCE IN CHAIRMAN GEORGE BALL DESPITE THE LOSSES CALLING HIM THE MOST QUALIFIED GUY IN THE U. S.
48cc030w <NOISE> FOR AUTHORS AND PUBLISHERS A NEW COMPETITOR IN THE BOOK CLUB FIELD IS A GODSEND
48cc030x BOOK CLUB RIGHTS ARE SECOND ONLY TO PAPERBACK RIGHTS IN PROVIDING ADDITIONAL REVENUE FOR PUBLISHERS
48cc030y FURTHERMORE A BOOK CLUB IMPRIMATUR ON A BOOK GIVES IT ENORMOUS CACHET WITH BOOKSTORE MANAGERS
48cc030z NOT LONG AFTER THE NORTHWEST ANNOUNCEMENT THE INSTITUTE WIRED A PRESS RELEASE TO MEDIA ORGANIZATIONS DETAILING THE LARGE NUMBER OF PASSENGER COMPLAINTS ABOUT NORTHWEST'S SERVICE
48cc0310 AIRLINE PASSENGERS WHO FLY NORTHWEST APPEAR TO HAVE A LOT TO COMPLAIN ABOUT AND THEY DID SO IN DROVES LAST YEAR THE RELEASE BEGAN
48cc0311 <NOISE> IT WENT ON TO SAY THE COMPLAINTS AGAINST NORTHWEST INCREASED ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTEEN PERCENT IN THE PAST YEAR
48cc0312 MANY BLAME THAT CHANGE ON SIMPLE GEOGRAPHY AND AN EFFORT TO MOVE AWAY FROM UNIONS
48cc0313 BUT SOME CRITICS ALSO ACCUSE THE JAPANESE COMPANIES OF DELIBERATELY AVOIDING BLACKS
48cc0314 HONDA AND THE U. S. EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION SETTLED A BIG RACIAL DISCRIMINATION CASE LAST MONTH
48cc0315 <NOISE> THE TWO LABORATORIES THAT NICHOLS PURCHASED ARE IN LINCOLN NEBRASKA AND SIOUX CITY IOWA

48cc031a MANY ANALYSTS PREDICT THE STOCK COULD GO HIGHER SOON PERHAPS CROSSING THE THIRTY DOLLAR A SHARE BARRIER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A YEAR
48cc031b LONG TERM BULLS PREDICT N. C. N. B.'S PRICE COULD EASILY DOUBLE AND SOME SAY TRIPLE
48cc031c THE AGENCY HAS BEEN UNDER GROWING PRESSURE FROM REPRESENTATIVE JOHN DINGELL DEMOCRAT MICHIGAN AND OTHER LAWMAKERS TO TIGHTEN REGULATION OF THE GENERICS INDUSTRY
48cc031d SENATOR ORRIN HATCH REPUBLICAN UTAH RANKING MINORITY MEMBER ON THE SENATE LABOR AND HUMAN RESOURCES COMMITTEE WELCOMED THE PLAN
48cc031e IT IS MY STRONG BELIEF THAT SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE HAS BEEN UNCOVERED TO WARRANT THESE CHANGES HE SAID IN A STATEMENT
48cc0401 IT'S A SAD DAY FOR WALL STREET SAID A FIRST BOSTON CORPORATION SPOKESMAN
48cc0402 STOCK TRADERS CAUTIONED THAT THE GOVERNMENT HASN'T YET WON CONVICTIONS ON ITS LATEST CASES
48cc0403 BUT BOTH LAWMAKERS AND STOCK MARKET PROFESSIONALS SAID YESTERDAY'S ARRESTS SEND A CLEAR SIGNAL AN OVERHAUL OF TAKEOVER AND SECURITIES PRACTICES HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY LIKELY
48cc0404 SENATOR WILLIAM PROXMIRE DEMOCRAT WISCONSIN SHARPLY CRITICIZED THE FED FOR DROPPING THE M. ONE TARGET
48cc0405 HE ALSO CONTENDED THAT IT IS AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS AND UNWISE POLICY TO ALLOW M. ONE TO EXPAND AS RAPIDLY AS IT HAS
48cc0406 LAST YEAR M. ONE WHICH CONSISTS OF CHECKING DEPOSITS PLUS CASH HELD BY THE PUBLIC SOARED FIFTEEN POINT TWO PERCENT
48cc0407 THAT WAS FAR ABOVE THE FED'S TARGET OF THREE PERCENT TO EIGHT PERCENT
48cc0408 WHEN HU YAOBANG WAS DUMPED IN JANUARY AS THE COMMUNIST PARTY'S SECRETARY GENERAL MR. ZHAO WAS ELEVATED TO THAT POST ON AN ACTING BASIS
48cc0409 THAT MADE MR. ZHAO A PROTEGE OF DENG XIAOPING THE DE FACTO HEAD OF THE PARTY AS WELL AS THE GOVERNMENT
48cc040a IT IS A DELICATE POSITION REQUIRING HIM TO MANEUVER AMONG VARIOUS INTEREST GROUPS AND PERSONAL CLIQUES THAT MAKE UP CHINA'S TOP LEADERSHIP
48cc040b SOME HAVE CHARACTERIZED OUR COUNTERMEASURES AS PROTECTIONIST BROUGHT ABOUT BECAUSE OF CONGRESSIONAL PRESSURES
48cc040c THAT IS DEAD WRONG
48cc040d WE HAVE BEEN IN CONSULTATIONS WITH JAPAN ON THIS ISSUE SINCE NOVEMBER LONG BEFORE PRESENT TRADE LEGISLATION WAS INTRODUCED
48cc040e THE PRESIDENT'S ACTION WAS THE CULMINATION OF THAT PROCESS AND IT HAD NOTHING WHATSOEVER TO DO WITH TRADE BILLS
48cc040f PRESIDENT REAGAN BELIEVES THAT PEOPLE AND NATIONS SHOULD HONOR THEIR OBLIGATIONS
48cc040g THERE IS NOTHING PROTECTIONIST ABOUT THAT
48cc040h THE ONE HUNDRED SHARE INDEX CLOSED TEN POINT SIX POINTS HIGHER AT TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE POINT EIGHT
48cc040i THE FINANCIAL TIMES THIRTY SHARE INDEX ROSE ELEVEN POINT SIX TO ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE POINT FOUR

48cc040k VOLUME WAS LIGHT AT FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR POINT SIX MILLION SHARES COMPARED WITH SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY ONE POINT FOUR MILLION FRIDAY
48cc040l THE CLEAREST INDICATION OF JAPAN'S BIOTECHNOLOGY AMBITIONS MAY BE THE ATTENTION BEING GIVEN THE FIELD BY THE MINISTRY OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND INDUSTRY
48cc040m WHEN MITI GETS INVOLVED IT'S A SAFE BET THE NATION'S SENIOR STRATEGISTS HAVE TARGETED AN INDUSTRY FOR A BIG PUSH
48cc040n THOUGH MITI DOES SOME BIOTECH RESEARCH ITS MAIN ROLE IS TO SPUR AND GUIDE WORK BY OTHERS
48cc040o LIKE A FISHING BOAT TOSSING CHUM IN THE WATER IT FIRST CHARTS A COURSE AND THEN PLANTS MONEY TO ATTRACT MORE
48cc040p JAMES MAHONEY MR. CARSON'S SPOKESMAN SAYS THE SPLIT WITH MR. BUSHKIN OCCURRED AFTER MR. CARSON DECIDED TO SELL HIS TELEVISION PRODUCTION BUSINESS

48cc040s MR. CARSON IS SAID TO HAVE DECIDED TO SELL CARSON PRODUCTIONS PIECEMEAL INSTEAD OF AS A GOING CONCERN
48cc040t MR. BUSHKIN REPORTEDLY FAVORED *KEEPING* THE COMPANY WHOLE RATHER THAN AUCTIONING INDIVIDUAL ASSETS
48cc040u FRESH FACES APPEAR AT THE RAINBOW KITCHEN ALMOST DAILY AMONG THEM A YOUNG COUPLE BACK FROM A DISILLUSIONING JOB HUNTING SOJOURN TO THE SUN BELT
48cc040v THEY EXPECT TO BE ON THEIR FEET IN A MONTH
48cc040w OTHERS SHOW UP BETWEEN ODD JOBS OR IN THE SUMMER WHEN THEIR CHILDREN CAN'T GET FREE LUNCH AT SCHOOL
48cc040x HE SCORED A BIG TRIUMPH EARLY THIS YEAR PUSHING ASIDE LOCAL BUREAUCRATS WHO WANTED TO SHARE HIS SPOILS IN A ONE BILLION DOLLAR FREEWAY BEING BUILT IN GUANGDONG PRONG- PROVINCE

48cc0411 MANY ADMIRERS BELIEVE FIRMLY THAT IF ANYONE CAN GET BUSINESS DONE IN CHINA MR. WU CAN
48cc0412 TAEKWONDO LOOKS KIND OF LIKE KARATE SO I ASKED A KOREAN OFFICIAL FOR AN EXPLANATION OF THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO SPORTS
48cc0413 TAEKWONDO IS KOREAN
48cc0414 KARATE IS JAPANESE HE SNAPPED AND TURNED AWAY
48cc0415 MR. PAPAGEORGE SAID THESE WERE CONCEPTUAL NEGOTIATIONS
48cc0416 IDEAS WERE FLOWING
48cc0417 WE WERE SEEING WHAT WORKED FOR EACH OF US
48cc0418 THE TWO OF US WERE TRYING TO THINK OF A WAY TO SATISFY EVERYONE
48cc0419 BUT IT'S WHAT THIS ELECTION IS ALL ABOUT
48cc041a THE REAL QUESTION ON THE BALLOT IS SHOULD THE REAGAN YEARS CONTINUE BEYOND THE REAGAN YEARS
48cc041b BEYOND THE BUSH YEARS
48cc041c BEYOND EVEN THE QUAYLE YEARS
48cc041d THE SUPREME COURT WILL DETERMINE THAT AND THE NEXT PRESIDENT WILL DETERMINE THE COURT'S MAKEUP FOR AT LEAST ANOTHER GENERATION
48cc041e WARNER LAMBERT AND SCHERING PLOUGH ARE COVETED FOR THEIR OVER THE COUNTER DRUGS AS WELL AS FOR PRESCRIPTION SALES
48cc041f OVER THE COUNTER DRUGS SUCH AS WARNER LAMBERT'S LISTERINE MOUTHWASH ARE THOUGHT TO HAVE FRANCHISE VALUE
48cc041g <NOISE> THEY AREN'T RESEARCH INTENSIVE THEY'RE MARKETING INTENSIVE ONE ANALYST SAID
48dc0201 THE SALE OF THE HOTELS IS PART OF HOLIDAY'S STRATEGY TO SELL OFF ASSETS AND CONCENTRATE ON PROPERTY MANAGEMENT
48dc0202 <NOISE> THE HOTEL OPERATOR'S EMBASSY SUITES HOTELS INCORPORATED SUBSIDIARY <NOISE> WILL CONTINUE TO MANAGE THE PROPERTIES
48dc0203 <NOISE> LONG TERM MANAGEMENT CONTRACTS ALLOW US TO GENERATE INCOME ON A SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER CAPITAL BASE SAID MICHAEL D. ROSE HOLIDAY'S CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
48dc0204 ALBERT HALPRIN CHIEF OF THE F. C. C.'S COMMON CARRIER BUREAU SAID HE HADN'T SEEN THE CONSUMER GROUP'S STUDY
48dc0205 <NOISE> HE SAID PREVIOUS STUDIES BY THE GROUP HAD FOCUSED ON FLAT RATE SERVICE FOR LOCAL CALLS
48dc0206 <NOISE> MR. HALPRIN CONCEDED THAT SUCH RATES HAD RISEN SHARPLY BUT HE ADDED THAT PHONE COMPANIES NOW OFFER A VARIETY OF LOCAL TELEPHONE PLANS AT DIFFERING PRICES
48dc0207 AROUND THAT TIME MR. GENGER ALSO MET WITH MR. EL SAYED
48dc0208 HE SURFACED TO MEET WITH GENGER AFTER GENGER HAD MADE THE APPROACH TO THE COMPANY SAID MR. TROTMAN THE DREXEL BURNHAM BANKER
48dc0209 <NOISE> I THINK HE WAS TRYING TO FIND A WAY BACK IN
48dc020a <NOISE> BUT MR. TROTMAN SAID MR. EL SAYED ISN'T INVOLVED IN THE TRANS RESOURCES BID
48dc020b INSTEAD MR. REAGAN AGREED TO LOWER THE VOLUME OF HIS COMMENTS SUPPORTING THE CONTRAS AND CRITICIZING THE DEMOCRATIC CONTROLLED CONGRESS
48dc020c HE ALSO WOULD HOLD OFF ON ANY NEW PROPOSALS FOR CONTRA MILITARY AID UNTIL SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH
48dc020d IF THE SANDINISTA GOVERNMENT HAD MADE SIGNIFICANT DEMOCRATIC REFORMS AND A CEASEFIRE WAS IN PLACE MR. REAGAN WOULD END HIS CONTRA MILITARY AID PROGRAM
48dc020e <NOISE> IN KOREA LABOR CONFLICTS HAVE ADDED HEAT TO THE UNSTABLE POLITICAL SITUATION
48dc020f THE NEW UNIONS ARE GROWING MORE ADVERSARIAL
48dc020g COMPANIES KEEP ASKING THE GOVERNMENT TO SMASH THE UNIONS
48dc020h BUT THE RULING PARTY CAN'T RISK ALIENATING WORKERS WHO WILL VOTE IN THE COMING ELECTIONS
48dc020i IT REFUSES SO FAR TO BACKTRACK ON ITS JULY FIRST PROMISE OF GREATER DEMOCRACY OR TO RETURN TO THE POLICY OF OVERT UNION BUSTING
48dc020j IN A NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT TO SEVENTY NINE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING THE S. E. C.'S ENFORCEMENT DIVISION PRESSED FOR MR. KOBRIN'S PERMANENT EXPULSION FROM THE SECURITIES BUSINESS
48dc020k THE DIVISION ARGUED THAT STOCK MANIPULATION OF THE KIND HE HAD BEEN ENGAGED IN WENT TO THE HEART OF THE SECURITIES LAWS
48dc020l THE DIVISION ALSO SAID THE LAW DIRECTED THE S. E. C. TO ACT ON THE BELIEF THAT PAST MISCONDUCT RAISED A RISK OF FUTURE MISCONDUCT THAT MIGHT JUSTIFY EXPULSION
48dc020m CERTAINLY FOREIGN COMPETITION AND A CHANGING WORLD ECONOMY HAVE EXACTED A HEAVY TOLL ON OUR NATION'S MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES
48dc020n HOWEVER MANY OF THESE INDUSTRIES HAVE SURVIVED AND ARE NOW AS TOUGH AND LEAN AS THEY'VE EVER BEEN
48dc020o THE MANAGERS OF THESE COMPANIES HAVE LEARNED THROUGH HARD EXPERIENCE ABOUT EXACTLY WHICH INVESTMENTS PAY OFF
48dc020p ALTHOUGH AIRLINES DENY HANDLING COMPLAINTS DIFFERENTLY THEY MAKE NO APOLOGIES ABOUT FAVORING FREQUENT FLIERS IN OTHER WAYS
48dc020q THEY SAY THEY ARE ONLY TRYING TO BOOST MEMBERSHIP IN THESE PROGRAMS WHICH AIRLINES CONSIDER CRUCIAL FOR DEVELOPING BRAND LOYALTY
48dc020r THESE ARE OUR MOST IMPORTANT CUSTOMERS SAYS A UNITED SPOKESMAN
48dc020s MR. ANTONIU'S FALL AND SURPRISING REBOUND PROVE THERE IS LIFE AFTER INSIDER TRADING
48dc020t BUT HIS STORY ALSO SUGGESTS THAT SOME CHARACTER TRAITS THAT MAY GIVE RISE TO INSIDER TRAINING CAN BE HARD TO CHANGE
48dc020u INSIDER TRADING IS A FORM OF FRAUD AND SOME SPORT ABOUT FRANCHISEES NOW CLAIM THEY HAVE BEEN DEFRAUDED BY MR. ANTONIU
48dc020v STILL TRADERS WERE ENCOURAGED BY INVESTOR REACTION TO THIS WEEK'S TREASURY FINANCING ESPECIALLY YESTERDAY'S THIRTY YEAR BOND SALE
48dc020w WE THOUGHT THERE WAS VERY BROAD JAPANESE PARTICIPATION IN THE BOND AUCTION SAID <NOISE> MR. LAKEFIELD OF SHEARSON LEHMAN
48dc020x <NOISE> BUT THE REAL QUESTION IS WHETHER THE JAPANESE BOUGHT FOR SHORT TERM TRADING ACCOUNTS OR FOR LONG TERM INVESTMENT
48dc020y INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS LOOKING FOR SOME EXCITEMENT IN THEIR LIVES AREN'T LIKELY TO BE ENTHRALLED BY MR. BERG'S ADVICE
48dc020z HE SUGGESTS THAT THEY DROP THEIR HARD EARNED DOLLARS INTO THE MOST CONSERVATIVE OF INVESTMENTS T. BILLS AND SIT TIGHT
48dc0210 THERE'S NO SENSE TRYING TO PLAY GAMES WITH THIS MARKET MR. BERG EXPLAINS
48dc0211 THINGS ARE A BIT DULLER THIS YEAR
48dc0212 MR. BILZERIAN HAS SENT HIS BOY TO A LITTLE LEAGUE TEAM IN FARAWAY MINNESOTA WHERE THE FAMILY SPENDS ITS SUMMERS AND ISN'T COACHING A TEAM THIS YEAR
48dc0213 ALL THE ACTION APPARENTLY WILL BE IN THE COURTROOM
48dc0214 THE GRAND METROPOLITAN OPERATIONS WHICH WERE ACQUIRED BY THAT COMPANY IN NINETEEN EIGHTY HAVE ENJOYED A GOOD REPUTATION IN THE INDUSTRY
48dc0215 BUT PEPSICO FEELS ITS TERRITORIES CAN BE BETTER EXPLOITED DUE TO THEIR PROXIMITY TO EXISITING COMPANY OWNED BOTTLERS
48dc0216 IT OWNS ITS LOS ANGELES AND SAN FRANCISCO BOTTLERS FOR INSTANCE MAKING THE CENTRAL CALIFORNIA TERRITORY A GOOD FIT
48dc0217 IT ALSO ALREADY OWNS ITS BOTTLERS IN CENTRAL AND NORTHERN FLORIDA AND PARTS OF GEORGIA
48dc0218 THERE ARE SOME GREAT OPPORTUNITIES TO MAXIMIZE PRODUCTION AND MARKETING EFFICIENCIES THE PEPSICO SPOKESMAN SAID
48dc0219 PETER DAPUZZO HEAD OF RETAIL TRADING AT SHEARSON LEHMAN HUTTON ALSO LOOKS FOR A SHARP UPWARD MOVE IN STOCK PRICES GIVEN A FEW IFS
48dc021a ONE IS IF INVESTORS DON'T GET SPOOKED AT THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE CRASH
48dc021b ANOTHER IS IF THE FEDERAL RESERVE EASES INTEREST RATES
48dc021c AND A THIRD IS IF GEORGE BUSH WINS THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION
48dc021d BUT SERVICE MERCHANDISE JUMPED ONE AND THREE EIGHTHS TO EIGHTEEN AND ONE QUARTER ON ONE POINT FOUR MILLION SHARES
48dc021e THE STOCK SLID TO TWELVE AND ONE QUARTER IN SEPTEMBER AFTER THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT AN INVESTOR GROUP HAD DECIDED NOT TO PROCEED WITH A POSSIBLE ACQUISITION OFFER
48dc021f SINCE THEN THE STOCK HAS BEEN RISING ON TAKEOVER RUMORS
48dc0301 WHEN HU YAOBANG WAS DUMPED IN JANUARY AS THE COMMUNIST PARTY'S SECRETARY GENERAL MR. ZHAO WAS ELEVATED TO THAT POST ON AN ACTING BASIS
48dc0302 THAT MADE MR. ZHAO A PROTEGE OF DENG XIAOPING THE DE FACTO HEAD OF THE PARTY AS WELL AS THE GOVERNMENT
48dc0303 IT IS A DELICATE POSITION REQUIRING HIM TO MANEUVER AMONG VARIOUS INTEREST GROUPS AND PERSONAL CLIQUES THAT MAKE UP CHINA'S TOP LEADERSHIP
48dc0304 PAINEWEBBER ITSELF HASN'T BEEN CHARGED WITH WRONGDOING
48dc0305 <NOISE> THE FIRM A UNIT OF PAINEWEBBER GROUP INCORPORATED RELEASED A SHORT STATEMENT YESTERDAY IN WHICH IT SAID THE TWO MEN HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED INDEFINITELY
48dc0306 THE FIRM HAS COOPERATED WITH THE U. S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE THROUGHOUT THE INVESTIGATION AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO
48dc0307 THEN THERE ARE UTILITY STOCKS
48dc0308 THE NASDAQ UTILITY INDEX JUMPED EIGHTEEN PERCENT IN THE FIRST QUARTER WHILE INDEXES OF LISTED UTILITY STOCKS ROSE BARELY THREE PERCENT
48dc0309 BUT IN FACT MOST OF THE FIFTY FIVE ELECTRIC GAS AND WATER UTILITY STOCKS ON NASDAQ PERFORMED MUCH LIKE THEIR COUNTERPARTS ON THE MAJOR EXCHANGES
48dc030a PRODUCERS HOWEVER SAY THE GUILD DEMAND REALLY REPRESENTS AN EFFORT TO SQUEEZE IN MORE THAN ONE SESSION A DAY
48dc030b THE ACTORS ARE PAID BY THE SESSION NOT BY THE HOUR AND BOTH SIDES AGREE THAT SESSIONS RARELY EXCEED THREE HOURS
48dc030c AND WITH THE GUILD CHOOSING SUCH A CRITICAL TIME FOR THE STRIKE <NOISE> T. V. PRODUCTION OFFICIALS ARE ESPECIALLY IRATE
48dc030d WHEN MY FAMILY FLED WE LEFT MY NANNY IN CHARGE OF THE HOUSE
48dc030e <NOISE> BUT SOON A LIEUTENANT IN THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMY EVICTED HER AND INSTALLED HIS MISTRESS
48dc030f LATER THE HOUSE WENT TO THE NORTH KOREANS
48dc030g F. D. A. RESEARCHERS SAY THEY DON'T KNOW MUCH YET ABOUT THE LONG TERM EFFECTS OF FAT SUBSTITUTES MIXING WITH MEDICATION AND OTHER SUBSTANCES
48dc030h TYPICALLY LAB TESTS ON FOOD PRODUCTS ARE FOR THE LIFE CYCLE OF RATS OR MICE ABOUT FOUR YEARS
48dc030i RESEARCHERS SAY THEY AREN'T SURE SUCH TESTS PARALLEL HUMAN CONSUMPTION OF FAT OVER LONGER PERIODS
48dc030j WE JUST DON'T KNOW SAYS THE F. D. A.'S MR. MERTZ
48dc030k WITH EVERY NEW DEVELOPMENT THERE ARE RISKS
48dc030l ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE TALKS SURPRISED ANALYSTS AND FAILED TO IMPRESS INVESTORS
48dc030m <NOISE> BRITISH AEROSPACE SHARES FELL TWENTY FIVE PENCE FORTY FOUR CENTS TO THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE PENCE IN LATE TRADING YESTERDAY ON LONDON'S STOCK EXCHANGE
48dc030n THE HANDFUL OF ROVER SHARES TRADING JUMPED NINETEEN PENCE TO EIGHTY SIX PENCE AFTER THE ANNOUNCEMENT BUT FELL BACK TO EIGHTY TWO PENCE
48dc030o MR. THAYER SAID MR. YOUNG RECEIVED A LUMP SUM PAYMENT TO SETTLE HIS CONTRACT WITH GIBRALTAR FINANCIAL BUT WOULDN'T DISCLOSE THE AMOUNT
48dc030p MR. YOUNG'S CONTRACT WHICH RAN UNTIL JANUARY TWENTY FOURTH NINETEEN NINETY ONE <NOISE> CALLED FOR A SALARY OF AT LEAST FOUR HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR
48dc030q IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX MR. YOUNG WAS PAID FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND NINETY SIX DOLLARS
48dc030r AS A RECENT VISIT REVEALED THE SOUP KITCHEN HAS BECOME A POWERFUL MAGNET DRAWING HUNDREDS WHO COME FOR MORE THAN JUST DAILY NOURISHMENT
48dc030s MR. KOVACS AN OCTOGENARIAN WHO CROONS LOVE BALLADS TO ANYONE WHO WILL LISTEN COMES FOR CAMARADERIE
48dc030t FOR GEORGE A MIDDLE AGED RETARDED MAN THE KITCHEN IS A LIFELINE
48dc030u HE ARRIVED FIVE YEARS AGO PICKED UP A BROOM AND WITHOUT SAYING A WORD STARTED CLEANING UP HE NOW GETS PAID THE MINIMUM WAGE
48dc030v THE OFFER IS A BRILLIANT DEFENSE CONTRIVED BY SANTA FE'S INVESTMENT BANKERS AT SALOMON BROTHERS AND GOLDMAN SACHS
48dc030w A SIXTY THREE DOLLAR A SHARE PRICE WILL HANG OVER THE NEGOTIATIONS LIKE SMOG OVER LOS ANGELES
48dc030x AND THOUGH MR. DINGMAN WILL OFFER PACKAGE AFTER PACKAGE THAT SEEMS TO ADD UP TO SIXTY THREE DOLLARS HE DOESN'T REALLY PLAN TO MEET THE ASKING PRICE
48dc030y INSTEAD HE HOPES TO PERSUADE SANTA FE TO TAKE LESS
48dc030z FOR ONE HUNDRED YEARS WYOMING HAS BEEN RIDING A ROLLER COASTER
48dc0310 WHEN COMMODITY PRICES RISE PEOPLE RUSH TO WYOMING FOR SHORT TERM WORK AT BOOM TOWN PAY
48dc0311 GOVERNMENT REVENUES LARGELY UNDERWRITTEN BY ENERGY COMPANY TAXES EXPLODE
48dc0312 WHEN COMMODITY PRICES SOUR PEOPLE PULL OUT OFTEN WITH THEIR MOBILE HOMES TRAILING BEHIND
48dc0313 AND REVENUES SLUMP
48dc0314 THE REASON FOR THE RELATIVELY MODEST INCENTIVE PROGRAMS IS THAT THE AUTO MAKERS ARE DEMONSTRATING A MUCH BETTER ABILITY TO KEEP PRODUCTION IN LINE WITH SALES
48dc0315 INVENTORIES OF U. S. MADE CARS STOOD AT FIFTY NINE DAYS SUPPLY AT THE END OF AUGUST ACCORDING TO WARD'S AUTOMOTIVE REPORTS AN INDUSTRY TRADE PUBLICATION
48dc0316 THAT IS CONSIDERED A NORMAL SUPPLY AND IT IS THE LOWEST STOCK IN TWENTY TWO MONTHS
48dc0317 TAKEOVER TALK AROUSED INTEREST IN TWO FINANCIAL CONCERNS
48dc0318 MERCANTILE BANCORP SOARED FIVE AND ONE HALF TO THIRTY AND THREE QUARTERS ON RENEWED BUY OUT SPECULATION
48dc0319 SUN STATE SAVINGS AND LOAN ENDED AT EIGHT AND ONE QUARTER UP TWO AFTER CONFIRMING THAT IT RECEIVED AN UNSOLICITED ACQUISITION PROPOSAL FROM AN INVESTMENT GROUP
48dc031a IN HOUSTON A COASTAL SPOKESMAN SAID THE FIGHT ISN'T OVER
48dc031b <NOISE> WE ANTICIPATE ASKING FOR A REHEARING OR APPEALING TO THE SUPREME COURT THE SPOKESMAN SAID
48dc031c HE ADDED WE WERE QUITE SURPRISED BY THE REVERSAL
48dc031d WE THOUGHT WE HAD A SOLID CASE
48dc0401 I'VE BEEN TRYING TO LIVE MY LIFE BY AN IDEA SHE SAYS POINTING TO A VIDEO GAME
48dc0402 SEE THAT MACHINE
48dc0403 THAT'S AN IDEA
48dc0404 ROCK AND ROLL
48dc0405 THAT'S AN IDEA
48dc0406 IN HEAVY TRADING FRIDAY PROFIT TAKING CAUSED THE NIKKEI AVERAGE TO SLIP SEVENTY POINT EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND FIVE POINT EIGHT FIVE
48dc0407 THE DECLINE SNAPPED A STRING OF FIVE RECORD CLOSINGS
48dc0408 THE STOCK EXCHANGE INDEX FELL TWELVE POINT NINE TWO POINTS TO ONE EIGHTEEN HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN POINT SIX NINE
48dc0409 VOLUME TOTALED ABOUT ONE BILLION SHARES
48dc040a MR. ABBOUD ALSO GAINED A REPUTATION DURING THE FIRST CHICAGO YEARS AS BEING ABRASIVE AND SOMETIMES HARSH WITH SUBORDINATES AND THAT TAG HAS LINGERED
48dc040b I'VE NEVER SEEN AN ADJECTIVE USED SO MUCH IN CONNECTION WITH A PERSON'S NAME HE SAID IN A NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR INTERVIEW
48dc040c PEOPLE THINK THE A. IN A. ROBERT ABBOUD STANDS FOR ABRASIVE
48dc040d IN AMSTERDAM STOCKS CLOSED LOWER IN VOLATILE TRADING
48dc040e SELECTED ISSUES ENDED OFF THEIR INTRADAY LOWS THOUGH AFTER WALL STREET'S LOWER OPENING PROVED LESS SEVERE THAN SOME DUTCH FORECASTERS ANTICIPATED DEALERS SAID
48dc040f <NOISE> VOLATILE TRADING THROUGHOUT THE SESSION PRODUCED WIDE PRICE FLUCTUATIONS AS DUTCH INSTITUTIONS BARGAIN HUNTED WHILE OVERSEAS INVESTORS TENDED TO SELL SHARES
48dc040g RATES ARE DETERMINED BY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PURCHASE PRICE AND FACE VALUE
48dc040h THUS HIGHER BIDDING NARROWS THE INVESTOR'S RETURN WHILE LOWER BIDDING WIDENS IT
48dc040i THE PERCENTAGE RATES ARE CALCULATED ON A THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY DAY YEAR WHILE THE COUPON EQUIVALENT YIELD IS BASED ON A THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE DAY YEAR
48dc040j TECHNICALLY THE STOPGAP BILL WILL LEAVE THE GOVERNMENT OUT OF MONEY OVER THE WEEKEND
48dc040k BUT THAT SHOULD HAVE LITTLE PRACTICAL EFFECT SINCE MOST OPERATIONS WILL BE CLOSED DURING THAT TIME
48dc040l CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS HOPE HOWEVER IT WILL PRESSURE LAWMAKERS TO FINISH THEIR WORK BEFORE MONDAY
48dc040m SOME MONTHS BEFORE THE CRASH INTEREST RATES STARTED TO MOVE UP
48dc040n HOME MORTGAGE RATES WENT UP ALMOST TEN TIMES AS FAST AS THEY CAME DOWN
48dc040o THE MONEY SUPPLY GROWTH WAS MUDDLING AT OR BELOW THE LOWER END OF THE TARGET RANGE A PHENOMENON WE HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED FOR MANY YEARS
48dc040p FOR A SHIP OR MISSILE GUIDED BY THE WRONG TIME SIGNAL THAT LITTLE GAP COULD MEAN ARRIVING AT THE WRONG DESTINATION
48dc040q IF WE LET THE DIFFERENCE GROW SAYS MR. MCCARTHY WE COULD RUN INTO PROBLEMS OVER THOUSANDS OF YEARS
48dc040r IT MIGHT BE NOON BY ATOMIC TIME BUT DARK OUTSIDE
48dc040s THIS HEADY MIXTURE OF PIETY AND GUTTER FIGHTING WE FEAR IS LIKELY TO DETRACT FROM CAUSES WE WOULD LIKE TO ADVANCE
48dc040t THIS IS PERFECTLY ILLUSTRATED BY MR. ROBERTSON'S CHARGE THAT THERE ARE RUSSIAN INTERMEDIATE RANGE MISSILES IN CUBA
48dc040u IT IS PERFECTLY TRUE THAT THE I. N. F. TREATY GIVES US NO RIGHTS TO INSPECT FOR MISSILES IN THE SOVIET'S ISLAND SATELLITE
48dc040v AND IT IS TRUE THAT SOVIET BASES THERE ARE A DANGER TO THE U. S.
48dc040w BUT TO POSE THESE VALID ISSUES IN THE MOST INFLAMMATORY WAY MR. ROBERTSON HAS CHARGED THAT THE MISSILES ARE ALREADY DEPLOYED AND IN PLACE
48dc040x IF THIS IS PRESENTED AS THE ISSUE THE ANSWER IS NO AND THE VALID POINTS ARE LOST
48dc040y KAISER'S PRESENT VALUE IS EQUALLY UNCERTAIN THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT ITS NET WORTH IS AT LEAST A NEGATIVE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS
48dc040z IN ITS LAWSUITS AGAINST FORMER MANAGEMENT THE COMPANY IS SEEKING DAMAGES OF MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR ALLEGED SELF DEALING AND MISMANAGEMENT
48dc0410 <NOISE> IN THE PROCESS THE SUITS ALLEGE ASSETS WERE OVERSTATED AND LIABILITIES UNDERSTATED
48dc0411 THE SHORTAGE OF WESTERN CAPACITY MAKES SOVIET LAUNCHERS ATTRACTIVE
48dc0412 A SERIES OF LAUNCH DISASTERS INCLUDING THE CHALLENGER EXPLOSION SEVERELY CURTAILED WESTERN ACCESS TO SPACE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX TO EIGHTY SEVEN
48dc0413 THE EUROPEAN ARIANE LAUNCHER JUST RETURNED TO COMMERCIAL SERVICE
48dc0414 THE U. S. SPACE PROGRAM WILL NOT ELIMINATE ITS BACKLOG OF PAYLOADS UNTIL THE EARLY NINETEEN NINETIES
48dc0415 YOU THINK THAT'S WEIRD
48dc0416 THINK AGAIN
48dc0417 HE'S NOT ALONE
48dc0418 CARBIDE'S SABOTAGE THEORY IS WEAKENED PARTLY BECAUSE IT HASN'T DISCLOSED ALL ITS EVIDENCE
48dc0419 THOUGH ITS ATTORNEYS SAY THEY HAVE INTERVIEWED THE ALLEGED SABOTEUR EXTENSIVELY THEY WON'T DISCLOSE HIS NAME OR WHEREABOUTS OR DESCRIBE HIM
48dc041a THEY ALSO DECLINE TO SAY WHETHER THEY UNDERSTAND HIS MOTIVES OR HAVE ANY WITNESSES
48dc041b THE ONE ELEMENT OF SUSPENSE REMAINS THE SELECTION OF A RUNNING MATE FOR VICE PRESIDENT BUSH'S PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN
48dc041c BUSH MANAGERS INSIST THEY WON'T DISCLOSE THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE'S IDENTITY UNTIL THURSDAY MORNING
48dc041d REAGAN ARRIVED AT THE CONVENTION SITE LAST NIGHT AND PREPARED FOR HIS FAREWELL SPEECH TO THE PARTY TONIGHT
48dc041e THE PRESIDENT LEAVES FOR CALIFORNIA TOMORROW AND BUSH WILL ARRIVE TO TAKE CONTROL OF THE CONVENTION
48dc041f IT IS A CRUCIAL TIME IN WHICH BUSH MUST ATTEMPT TO MOVE OUT FROM UNDER REAGAN'S SHADOW AND ESTABLISH HIS OWN IDENTITY
48ec0201 PHIL WALTERS WHOSE BACK YARD WOULD HAVE FACED THE PROPOSED SHELTER SAYS HE WENT TO MEETINGS TO LEARN BOTH SIDES OF THE SHELTER DEBATE
48ec0202 BUT JUST FOR WANTING TO HEAR THE PROS AND CONS I BECAME A PRO DERELICT REVOLUTIONARY IN THE EYES OF SOME PEOPLE HE RECALLS
48ec0203 THEY DIDN'T WANT AN OBJECTIVE STUDY
48ec0204 THEY JUST WANTED TO PREVENT THE ONSLAUGHT OF THE BUMS
48ec0205 FRANCE FUND INC. HAD A NET ASSET VALUE OF FOURTEEN DOLLARS AND FORTY SIX CENTS AND A CLOSING PRICE OF TEN AND AN EIGHTH AS OF THURSDAY
48ec0206 GABELLI EQUITY TRUST INCORPORATED HAD A NET ASSET VALUE OF NINE DOLLARS THIRTY SIX CENTS AND A CLOSING PRICE OF EIGHT AND SEVEN EIGHTHS AS OF FRIDAY
48ec0207 IN THE LISTING OF PUBLICLY TRADED FUNDS IN AN EARLIER EDITION THE LINES WERE REVERSED
48ec0208 BANCROFT CONVERTIBLE FUND INC. HAD A NET ASSET VALUE OF TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS EIGHTY EIGHT CENTS AND A CLOSING PRICE OF TWENTY SEVEN AND A QUARTER AS OF FRIDAY
48ec0209 IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SOME GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES C. I. A. HAD TO GIVE UP FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS
48ec020a NOW IT IS SUGGESTED THAT OFFICIALS GIVE UP FIFTH AMENDMENT RIGHTS
48ec020b IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SOMEONE IS GOING TO SUGGEST THAT GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS GIVE UP THEIR FOURTH AMENDMENT RIGHTS PROTECTING THEM FROM UNLAWFUL SEARCHES
48ec020c WHY NOT
48ec020d THEY MAY BE HIDING IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS IN THEIR HOMES
48ec020e CABLE OPERATORS ARE WILLING PARTICIPANTS IN THE PRICE CUTTING PROGRAMS
48ec020f FOR ONE THING BECAUSE OF DEREGULATION WHICH TOOK EFFECT JANUARY FIRST THE OPERATORS HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO RAISE RATES FOR BASIC CABLE SERVICE
48ec020g IN ADDITION THE PAY NETWORKS ARE CUTTING THE PRICES THEY CHARGE OPERATORS
48ec020h CONGRESS GAVE THE SPACE AGENCY'S PLAN MIXED REVIEWS
48ec020i REPRESENTATIVE BILL LOWERY REPUBLICAN OF CALIFORNIA WHO HAS BEEN OUTSPOKEN ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF SECURING A SECOND BOOSTER ROCKET SUPPLIER PRAISED THE PLAN
48ec020j <NOISE> COMPETITION FUELS EXCELLENCE HE SAID AND THIS IS THE FIRST STEP TOWARD A SOLID ROCKET MOTOR WITH BETTER SAFETY PRECAUTIONS AND MORE EFFICIENT PRODUCTION
48ec020k ENERGY EXPERTS CONSIDER AMOCO AND EXXON AMONG THE INDUSTRY'S HEALTHIEST COMPANIES FINANCIALLY WITH STRONG CREDIT RATINGS AND LOW DEBT
48ec020l AMOCO'S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHOW IT HAD FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN CASH AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES ON HAND AT THE CLOSE OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
48ec020m IN RECENT TALKS WITH ANALYSTS AMOCO OFFICIALS HAVE SAID THE COMPANY IS WELL POSITIONED FINANCIALLY IF IT DECIDES TO MAKE AN ACQUISITION
48ec020n MOREOVER A WESTERN FIRM HAS TO MAKE SOME CALCULATION OF WHETHER MR. GORBACHEV <NOISE> WILL SUCCEED IN HIS EFFORTS TO ACTIVATE THE SOVIET WORK FORCE
48ec020o PAST EXPERIENCE AND CURRENT REPORTS INDICATE THAT HIS CHANCES AREN'T GOOD
48ec020p ROWLAND EVANS AND ROBERT NOVAK REPORTED FROM MOSCOW LAST WEEK THAT THE PARTY APPARATCHIKS AND DISAFFECTED SOVIET WORKERS ALREADY ARE UNDERMINING REFORMS
48ec020q THE GOVERNMENT FACES A KNOTTY SURPLUS PROBLEM
48ec020r U. S. STORAGE BINS HOLD ROUGHLY AN EIGHT MONTH SUPPLY OF CORN AND TEN MONTH SUPPLY OF WHEAT WHEN A THREE MONTH SUPPLY WOULD DO
48ec020s MAKING MATTERS WORSE THE HARVEST RIPENING IN THE FIELDS PROMISES TO BE A MONSTER PORTENDING RECORD POST HARVEST SUPPLIES OF CORN AND A GLUT OF OTHER COMMODITIES
48ec020t TO HELP CUT PRODUCTION THE U. S. IS PAYING FARMERS AN ANNUAL RENT FOR TEN YEARS TO IDLE EROSION PRONE CROP LAND UNDER A CONSERVATION RESERVE PROGRAM
48ec020u HUMANA TRIED TO DEFEND ITSELF THROUGH DIVERSIFICATION AS DID THE OTHER LARGE CHAINS HOSPITAL CORP. OF AMERICA AMERICAN MEDICAL INTERNATIONAL INCORPORATED AND NATIONAL MEDICAL ENTERPRISES INCORPORATED
48ec020v THE IDEA WAS THAT IF A HOSPITAL OWNER ALSO HAD AN INSURANCE PLAN IT COULD STEER PATIENTS TO ITS INSTITUTIONS THROUGH FINANCIAL INCENTIVES
48ec020w THE PATIENT POOL MIGHT SHRINK BUT THE COMPANY COULD GRAB A BIGGER PART OF IT
48ec020x KEMP'S CAMPAIGN TAKES ON AN INCREASINGLY DESPERATE TONE
48ec020y IN ONE SURE SIGN OF A CANDIDACY IN TROUBLE HE LASHES OUT AT CRITICISM FROM A LIGHTLY REGARDED T. V. COMMENTATOR
48ec020z EVEN SOME SUPPORTERS NOW SAY PRIVATELY THAT HE SHOULD AIM FOR THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION
48ec0210 BUT HIS LONGTIME HOSTILITIES WITH DOLE LEAVE A SPOT ON A BUSH TICKET AS ABOUT THE ONLY POSSIBILITY
48ec0211 WE'VE NEVER HAD ONE BEFORE MR. TIMBERS SAID
48ec0212 A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF OUR CLIENTS WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THAT OPTION
48ec0213 IT'S NOT NECESSARILY A MARKET CALL
48ec0214 MR. TIMBERS SAYS HE'S FAIRLY AMBIVALENT ABOUT THE PRICE OF GOLD NEAR TERM
48ec0215 HE DOES SEE HOWEVER HIGHER INFLATION OF FIVE PERCENT OR SO IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE UP FROM FOUR PERCENT THIS YEAR
48ec0216 A GOLD OPTION COULD BE A NICE ALTERNATIVE FOR FIXED INCOME INVESTORS SHOULD INFLATION FEARS ARISE MR. TIMBERS SAYS
48ec0217 BUT HE WARNS THAT COMPANIES SHOULD ASK HOW MUCH STOCK IS TOO MUCH
48ec0218 A DIRECTOR HOLDING A LARGE BLOCK MAY BECOME MORE INTERESTED IN SHORT TERM RESULTS THAN LONG TERM CORPORATE HEALTH
48ec0219 THAT DIRECTOR MAY BE MORE TEMPTED TO VOTE HIS POCKETBOOK IN A TAKEOVER FIGHT SAYS MR. WOLF
48ec021a AS BRITAIN'S FLAG CARRIER THE AIRLINE INHERITED A VAST ROUTE NETWORK
48ec021b BRITISH CALEDONIAN BROUGHT ROUTES TO THE SOUTHERN U. S. THE MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA AS WELL AS *LUCRATIVE* FLIGHTS TO EAST ASIA
48ec021c BRITISH AIRWAYS GAVE UP ONLY A FEW ROUTES FROM GATWICK TO EUROPEAN CITIES WHICH IN MOST CASES IT ALREADY SERVED FROM HEATHROW
48ec021d MR. BAKER IS ALSO WELL ACQUAINTED WITH RUDOLPH GIULIANI THE U. S. ATTORNEY FOR MANHATTAN WHO IS OVERSEEING THAT OFFICE'S INVESTIGATION OF DREXEL
48ec021e AS WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF MR. BAKER OFFERED MR. GIULIANI THE CHAIRMANSHIP OF THE S. E. C. IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
48ec021f MR. GIULIANI DECLINED THE POST WHICH WAS LATER ACCEPTED BY DAVID S. RUDER
48ec0301 ALL THE GAINS THAT WE'RE MAKING ARE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL SAYS JAMES F. MCDONALD G. M.'S PRESIDENT
48ec0302 THAT MAY BE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING HAPPENING IN HEAVY INDUSTRY IN THE U. S. TODAY
48ec0303 INDEED THE ERA OF BIG TIME NATIONAL LABOR TALKS IN WHICH UNION AND MANAGEMENT LEADERS BUTT HEADS OVER PENNIES AN HOUR IS WANING
48ec0304 ALSO SELLING WELL WAS A FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR ISSUE OF REVENUE BONDS BY THE FLORIDA DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES
48ec0305 THE UNSOLD BALANCE WAS ABOUT TEN POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS
48ec0306 THE BONDS WERE PRICED AFTER AUCTION TO YIELD FROM FOUR POINT TWO PERCENT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT TO SEVEN POINT TWO PERCENT IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE
48ec0307 MOODY'S RATED THE BONDS SINGLE A. WHILE S. AND P. RATED THEM SINGLE A. MINUS
48ec0308 GOLDMAN SACHS AND COMPANY WAS THE LEAD UNDERWRITER
48ec0309 HE TELLS US TO CLOSE OUR EYES AND IMAGINE THE BEACH
48ec030a FEEL THE SUNSHINE
48ec030b SMELL THE SEA AIR
48ec030c HEAR THE WAVES CRASHING AGAINST THE SHORE
48ec030d NOW FEEL YOURSELF PLAYING WITH THE DOLPHINS AND INVITE THEM BACK TO PLAY WITH YOU HERE MR. ROWE SAYS
48ec030e HE HAS SAID SOME OF US WILL BECOME DOLPHINS
48ec030f DESPITE MY BEST EFFORTS I REMAIN A REPORTER SEATED ON A CHAIR IN A BOOKSTORE
48ec030g MR. ZINN SAID ENTERTAINMENT MARKETING IS STILL WEIGHING A PROXY FIGHT
48ec030h IT'S A BAD FEELING IN YOUR STOMACH WHEN THE CHAIRMAN AND PREVIOUS BIDDER IS SELLING HIS BLOCK HE SAID
48ec030i IT DOESN'T MAKE ME AS A SHAREHOLDER COMFORTABLE WITH WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE COMPANY
48ec030j HE ALSO WAS EMPHATIC ABOUT KEEPING BURGER KING
48ec030k I WANT TO SAY WITHOUT QUALIFICATION THAT BURGER KING IS CENTRAL TO PILLSBURY
48ec030l IT WAS TRUE YESTERDAY IT IS TRUE TODAY AND IT REMAINS TRUE FOR THE COMPANY'S STRATEGIC FUTURE HE SAID
48ec030m SOME ISSUERS ALSO ARE WARY OF DOING AWAY WITH OUTSIDE COUNSEL
48ec030n IN WASHINGTON STATE A PROPOSAL TO USE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AS COUNSEL ON ALL STATE BOND ISSUES CAME BEFORE A LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE LAST YEAR
48ec030o ITS ADOPTION WOULD HAVE SAVED WASHINGTON MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR
48ec030p STRONG OPPOSITION FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE DEFEATED THE PROPOSAL HOWEVER
48ec030q MR. MORELAND COULDN'T BE REACHED FOR COMMENT BUT ATTORNEYS REPRESENTING HIM HAVE PREVIOUSLY DENIED HE COMMITTED ANY ACTS OF FRAUD
48ec030r AN ATTORNEY FOR MR. REYNOLDS IN SAN DIEGO SAID WE FEEL OUR CLIENT DID NOTHING IN VIOLATION OF THE SECURITIES LAWS
48ec030s JOSEPH A. JOHNSON A GEOLOGIST ALLEGEDLY HIRED BY MR. MORELAND WHO IS ALSO NAMED AS A DEFENDANT IN THE SUIT SAID HE HADN'T YET BEEN SERVED
48ec030t GRAINS AND SOYBEANS THE THREAT OF RAIN AND FAVORABLE SPRING PLANTING CONDITIONS PUSHED SOYBEANS AND CORN FUTURES PRICES LOWER
48ec030u THE LATEST WEATHER FORECAST CALLS FOR FAIRLY GOOD MOISTURE IN MIDWEST FARMING STATES OVER THE NEXT SIX TO TEN DAYS
48ec030v ANALYSTS SAID TRADERS ARE SHIFTING THEIR EMPHASIS AWAY FROM LAST YEAR'S CROPS AND TO THIS YEAR'S
48ec030w WITH THIS YEAR'S SMALL ACREAGE INCREASES WEATHER AND SPRING PLANTING CONDITIONS ARE MAJOR CONCERNS TO A MARKET THAT IS BEGINNING TO SHAKE OFF A HUGE SURPLUS
48ec030x THE FAVORABLE CONDITIONS HELPED THE SOYBEAN CONTRACT FOR NOVEMBER SETTLEMENT CLOSE AT SIX POINT EIGHT TWO TWO FIVE DOLLARS A BUSHEL DOWN NINE POINT FIVE CENTS
48ec030y FURTHER SIGNS OF STRONG U. S. ECONOMIC GROWTH ARE EXPECTED TO EMERGE FROM A LABOR DEPARTMENT REPORT NEXT FRIDAY ON THE NATION'S EMPLOYMENT PICTURE FOR AUGUST
48ec030z IF SO FEDERAL RESERVE OFFICIALS MAY RAISE SHORT TERM INTEREST RATES FURTHER WITHIN A FEW WEEKS SEVERAL ANALYSTS SAID
48ec0310 THEY ALSO PREDICTED THE BANKS WILL RAISE THEIR PRIME OR BASE RATES AGAIN TO TEN AND A HALF PERCENT OR ELEVEN PERCENT FROM THE CURRENT TEN PERCENT LEVEL
48ec0311 THE STUDY WAS PART OF CORNELL'S RESPONSE TO CALLS BY LOCAL POLITICIANS THAT IT SHOULD HELP MORE IN TOMPKINS COUNTY
48ec0312 WHEN THE SCHOOLS WERE RANKED BY OPERATING BUDGET OR VALUE OF BUILDINGS CORNELL'S ONE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLAR PAYMENTS WERE FOUND TO BE NEAR THE BOTTOM OF THE LIST
48ec0313 IN PER STUDENT PAYMENTS CORNELL RANKED SEVENTH AT SEVENTY DOLLARS
48ec0314 TO BE SURE ON A LOT OF SCORES THE SUMMIT WAS A SUCCESS
48ec0315 ECONOMIC COOPERATION WAS ADVANCED WITH BUSINESSMEN SIGNING AGREEMENTS FOR ABOUT THIRTY CONTRACTS AND SEVERAL JOINT VENTURES
48ec0316 HUMAN RIGHTS TOO MAY HAVE TAKEN A STEP FORWARD IF MR. GORBACHEV LIVES UP TO HIS PROMISE TO RELEASE ALL POLITICAL PRISONERS BY YEAR'S END
48ec0317 B. P. COULD SPEND UP TO TEN BILLION DOLLARS ON A U. S. TAKEOVER MR. LAZIER SAYS BY FINANCING IT WITH A BLEND OF DEBT AND EQUITY
48ec0318 LOS ANGELES BASED UNOCAL CORP. WITH EXTENSIVE REFINING AND MARKETING ACTIVITIES ON THE WEST COAST LONG HAS BEEN SEEN AS A POSSIBLE ACQUISITION TARGET
48ec0319 BUYING UNOCAL COULD ALSO GIVE B. P. A NEEDED BOOST IN ITS NATURAL GAS RESERVES
48ec031a OTHER TAKEOVER POSSIBILITIES INCLUDE PHILLIPS PETROLEUM COMPANY OF BARTLESVILLE OKLAHOMA AND NEW YORK BASED AMERADA HESS CORP.
48ec031b AS A RESULT IT CAN MAKE SALES IN KEEPING WITH MARKET CONDITIONS WITHOUT HAVING A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON ITS ECONOMY MR. NICHOLS SAID
48ec031c LAST YEAR IT'S ESTIMATED THE SOVIET UNION MADE BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION AND TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION FROM SALES OF PALLADIUM
48ec031d IT MADE BILLIONS ON GOLD
48ec0401 THE DEPARTMENT ALSO SAID THAT PRODUCTIVITY FOR NONFINANCIAL COMPANIES INCREASED AT A ZERO POINT THREE PERCENT ANNUAL RATE IN THE THIRD QUARTER A PRELIMINARY ESTIMATE
48ec0402 THE ESTIMATE IS BASED ON AN INCREASE IN OUTPUT OF ONE POINT FOUR PERCENT AND AN INCREASE IN HOURS WORKED OF ONE POINT ONE PERCENT
48ec0403 THIS WAS THE FIRST QUARTER IN WHICH PRODUCTIVITY INCREASED IN THE NONFINANCIAL SECTOR SINCE THE THIRD QUARTER OF NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE
48ec0404 IN RECENT YEARS HOWEVER INSIDER TRADING CASES HAVE SOMETIMES INVOLVED PEOPLE WHO ARE QUITE REMOTE FROM COMPANIES THAT ARE THE SUBJECT OF INSIDE INFORMATION
48ec0405 SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY THE SUPREME COURT HAS SUGGESTED WITHOUT BEING SPECIFIC THAT SUCH CASES MIGHT INVOLVE MISAPPROPRIATION OR ILLEGAL USE OF INFORMATION
48ec0406 A DECISION IN THE WINANS CASE MAY HELP DEFINE SECURITIES FRAUD BY MISAPPROPRIATION
48ec0407 THESE TEENS CRAVE EXCITEMENT
48ec0408 THEY SPURN REST AND RECREATION
48ec0409 THEY DREAM ABOUT POWER AND POTS OF MONEY
48ec040a ESPECIALLY MONEY
48ec040b LAST MONTH PIEDMONT'S BOARD RECOMMENDED THAT THE COMPANY ACCEPT NORFOLK SOUTHERN'S BID TO ACQUIRE THE COMPANY FOR SIXTY FIVE DOLLARS A SHARE
48ec040c NORFOLK SOUTHERN HAS HAD A STAKE IN PIEDMONT SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE
48ec040d BUT ONE DAY AFTER THE BOARD'S RECOMMENDATION U. S. AIR SWEETENED ITS INITIAL BID FOR PIEDMONT FORCING THE BOARD TO DROP ITS RECOMMENDATION
48ec040e INCO'S STOCK HAS CAUGHT TECHNICAL ANALYSTS' ATTENTION TOO
48ec040f IT RECENTLY BROKE OUT OF A FIVE YEAR TRADING RANGE SAYS MARTIN PRING EDITOR OF PRING MARKET REVIEW
48ec040g HE THINKS THE STOCK COULD BE POISED FOR BIG GAINS REFLECTING WHAT MAY BE A BULL MARKET IN BASE METALS
48ec040h WAS THAT THE EARTH SHIFTING IN MIKE *KINSLEY*'S VIEWPOINT COLUMN YESTERDAY ON THE PAGE OPPOSITE A DEMOCRATS' GUIDE TO ROBERT BORK
48ec040i MR. KINSLEY CALLED THE ROE V.
48ec040j WADE ABORTION DECISION ONE OF THE JUDICIAL EXCESSES OF ACTIVIST JUDGES
48ec040k THEN WE FOUND OURSELVES DESCRIBED AS THE CENTER OF CONSERVATIVE INTELLECTUAL HYPOCRISY ON JUDICIAL RESTRAINT
48ec040l WE BELIEVE WE'RE COMING TO UNDERSTAND THE MEANING OF NEOLIBERAL AN EX LIBERAL WHO ATTACKS CONSERVATIVES IN THE PROCESS OF ADOPTING THEIR POSITIONS
48ec040m THE FINDING UNIFORMLY SURPRISED LONGTIME RESEARCHERS IN THE FIELD
48ec040n THERE IS A SPECIFIC RATIONALE BEHIND T. H. A. SAYS DOCTOR LEON THAL A RESEARCHER AT SAN DIEGO VETERANS ADMINISTRATION HOSPITAL
48ec040o BUT THE RESULTS WERE OVERWHELMING AND WHEN YOU GET RESULTS LIKE THAT OUT OF THE BLUE THE FIRST REACTION IS TO BE SKEPTICAL
48ec040p THAT TEST WAS LESS THAN A COMPLETE SUCCESS
48ec040q DIRT THAT ACCUMULATED IN THE KENAF DURING HARVESTING WASN'T ALL REMOVED AND ENDED UP IN THE PAPER
48ec040r THE KENAF ALSO JAMMED IN SOME EQUIPMENT BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN CUT IN LENGTHS THAT WERE SEVERAL FEET LONG
48ec040s REPRESENTATIVE FOLEY SAID THERE WAS GENERAL AGREEMENT THAT A DEFICIT REDUCTION PACKAGE COULD CONSIST HALF OF SPENDING CUTS AND HALF REVENUE RAISING MEASURES
48ec040t BUT NEGOTIATORS STILL COULDN'T AGREE ON WHAT CONSTITUTES REVENUE RAISERS OR SPENDING CUTS
48ec040u HOUSE REPUBLICAN LEADER ROBERT MICHEL OF ILLINOIS COMPLAINED I'M JUST ASKING THE DEMOCRATS TO GIVE US REAL SAVINGS
48ec040v MOST ARAB STATES BROKE OFF RELATIONS WITH EGYPT WHEN THAT COUNTRY SIGNED A PEACE TREATY WITH ISRAEL EIGHT YEARS AGO

48ec0417 ANOTHER SALE WAS DELAYED WHEN THE LENDER DISCOVERED THAT THE OWNER HAD DIED BETWEEN THE TIME THE PROPERTY WAS POSTED FOR FORECLOSURE AND THE FORECLOSURE WAS COMPLETED
48ec0418 WE WERE AT THE CLOSING TABLE WHEN THIS ALL CAME OUT SAYS WANDA HUTCHINS THE MERRILL LYNCH AGENT
48ec0419 INVALID FORECLOSURES ARE ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS WE HAVE
48ec041a THE LOWER VOLATILITY COULD BE ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW WHEN THE COURSE OF INTEREST RATES SEEMS ESPECIALLY CLOUDY
48ec041b WHILE INTEREST RATES HAVE BEEN DECLINING RECENTLY MANY ECONOMISTS EXPECT RATES TO RISE BY YEAR END
48ec041c AFTER THAT HOWEVER THEY SAY RATES COULD FALL AGAIN PERHAPS SHARPLY AS ECONOMIC GROWTH SLOWS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE
48ec041d THE MOST WIDELY USED ESTROGEN PRODUCT IN THE U. S. IS SOLD UNDER THE BRAND NAME PREMARIN BY AMERICAN HOME PRODUCTS CORP.'S WYETH AYERST LABORATORIES

48ec041f A SPOKESMAN FOR THE COMPANY SAID PREMARIN ISN'T CURRENTLY INDICATED FOR USE IN PREVENTING HEART DISEASE BUT THE COMPANY IS RESEARCHING THE MATTER
48fc0201 THE ACCORD MOST LIKELY WOULD INCLUDE SOME PRIVATE AGREEMENT AMONG MINISTERS ON HOW FAR UP OR DOWN THESE RATES CAN MOVE AND STILL BE ACCEPTABLE
48fc0202 BUT OFFICIALS SAID IT IS UNLIKELY THESE LIMITS WOULD BE MADE PUBLIC
48fc0203 <NOISE> AND IT ISN'T KNOWN YET WHETHER THE MAJOR POWERS WOULD PLEDGE TO INTERVENE IN CURRENCY MARKETS IF EXCHANGE RATES WERE TO EXCEED THOSE LIMITS
48fc0204 <NOISE> HOW IS WALL STREET REACTING TO THE CHANGES
48fc0205 SOME INVESTMENT BANKERS FEEL THREATENED BY IT OTHERS SCOFF AT SUGGESTION THAT THESE EFFORTS ARE TRULY COMPETITIVE
48fc0206 BUT SOME SAY THE CASE ISN'T CLEAR
48fc0207 FEW DEVELOPERS ARE BIG ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY THE COST OF THESE DIVISIONS
48fc0208 THE TEST WILL BE WHETHER THE NEW UNITS ARE ADDING VALUE TO THEIR ORGANIZATIONS
48fc0209 IF NOT ONE INVESTMENT BANKER SAYS THE PARTNERS WILL KILL THEM
48fc020a IN CLEVELAND HIGBEE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER ROBERT BROADBENT SAYS THE RETAILER HAS BENEFITED FROM ITS PARENT'S FINANCIAL EXPERTISE
48fc020b ALTHOUGH IT WILL RETAIN CONTROL INDUSTRIAL EQUITY IS PLANNING TO TAKE HIGBEE PUBLIC AGAIN PROBABLY IN JUNE

48fc020g THIRTEEN YEARS AGO MR. SMITH WAS MIRED IN PERSONAL BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS
48fc020h NOW HE LIVES LIKE A SUCCESSFUL CORPORATE EXECUTIVE <NOISE>
48fc020i BUT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE
48fc020j HIS IS A TAX EXEMPT NOT FOR PROFIT CORPORATION DEDICATED TO HELPING MINORS THE SICK AND THE NEEDY
48fc020k IT ALSO HAS GREATLY HELPED THE SMITH FAMILY
48fc020l LAST YEAR THE CORPORATION PAID THE SMITHS AND A SON IN LAW MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS IN SALARIES AND BONUSES
48fc020m MR. SMITH ALSO HAD AN OUTSTANDING UNSECURED PERSONAL LOAN OF ONE HUNDRED TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND ENJOYED OTHER PERQUISITES
48fc020n AS FOR THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS THAT AUTHORIZES ALL THIS WELL FOUR SMITHS HUSBAND WIFE AND TWO CHILDREN CURRENTLY ARE THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
48fc020o U. S. UTILITIES COULD ALSO INCREASE ORDERS OF FOREIGN URANIUM AHEAD OF ANY TOTAL IMPORT RESTRICTIONS ANALYSTS SAY
48fc020p URANIUM FROM SOUTH AFRICA FOR EXAMPLE HAS ALREADY FALLEN UNDER ANTI APARTHEID SANCTIONS

48fc020t THE AGREEMENT IS A KEY PART OF ROBINS'S BANKRUPTCY REORGANIZATION PLAN
48fc020u ROBINS JUMPED ONE AND ONE HALF TO TWENTY ONE
48fc020v SOME CRITICS SEE THE GROWTH CONTROL MOVEMENT AS THE INDULGENCE OF A SELF SATISFIED MIDDLE CLASS
48fc020w <NOISE> AND SOME CHARGE THAT THERE ARE RACIST ROOTS
48fc020x THE FACT IS THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T LIKE SEEING HISPANICS AND ASIANS AROUND SAYS DANIEL GARCIA THE PRESIDENT OF THE LOS ANGELES PLANNING COMMISSION
48fc020y THE DIRT ROAD COMES TO A PAVED INTERSECTION AND MR. KGORI BEGINS A RIGHT TURN
48fc020z UP AHEAD HE SPOTS A ROADBLOCK WHERE A WHITE POLICEMAN WITH A DOG IS HOLDING UP THREE BLACKS TRAVELING ON A DONKEY PULLED WAGON
48fc0210 MR. KGORI DECIDES TO GO STRAIGHT ON THE DIRT ROAD EVEN THOUGH IT WILL TAKE HIM AN HOUR OUT OF HIS WAY
48fc0211 THAT WAS ILLUSTRATED BY A TEMPORARY SURGE IN SECURITIES LENDING DURING LAST OCTOBER'S CRASH AND A PREVIOUS SECURITIES SETTLEMENTS BACKLOG IN BRITAIN
48fc0212 SAID ONE U. K. MONETARY OFFICIAL CLEARLY THERE WAS DEMAND IN THE MARKET FOR MORE EQUITIES MONEY BROKING
48fc0213 WHAT YOU ARE SEEING WITH SHEARSON'S MOVE IS A REFLECTION OF THAT DEMAND
48fc0214 SOME BANKING ANALYSTS DOUBT A LONDON OR TOKYO BANK WOULD MAKE A SIMILAR ACQUISITION ANYTIME HERE SOON
48fc0215 AMONG OTHER THINGS SOME FOREIGN BANKS HAVE BEEN SHYING AWAY FROM ACQUIRING ASSETS IN THE U. S. BECAUSE OF UNEXPECTEDLY HIGH EXPENSES MANAGING THEM FROM AFAR
48fc0216 INSTEAD THE TREND AMONG FOREIGN BANKS IS TO INCREASINGLY BUILD ALLIANCES WITH U. S. BANKS
48fc0217 HE RETURNED HOME IN TIME FOR HIS FIFTEENTH BIRTHDAY IN MARCH NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
48fc0218 AS PART OF THE TREATMENT HE ATTENDED FIFTEEN WEEKS OF AFTER CARE FIVE DAYS A WEEK

48fc021b THE INVESTORS SHOULD HAVE BEEN TOLD SAID PAUL BERNSTEIN AN ATTORNEY FOR ONE OF THE SHAREHOLDERS
48fc021c <NOISE> HE SAID THE ALLEGED OMISSIONS MAKE THE PROSPECTUS MISLEADING
48fc021d <NOISE> THE SUITS SEEK DAMAGES OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE OFFERING PRICE AND THE MARKET PRICE WHEN THE SUITS WERE FILED
48fc021e TO THE EXTENT THAT EXPORT GROWTH CONTINUES IT WILL KEEP THE U. S. ECONOMY FROM SLIPPING ADDED MR. WITTEN
48fc021f SO YOU CAN HAVE A SOFT LANDING SCENARIO BASED ON EXPANDING EXPORTS
48fc021g A SOFT LANDING COMBINES MODERATE ECONOMIC GROWTH WITH LOW INFLATION
48fc0301 PRICES MOVED UP IN RESPONSE TO NEWS THAT U. S. DURABLE GOODS ORDERS DECLINED SEVEN AND A HALF PERCENT IN JANUARY
48fc0302 PRICES ALSO SLID AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE TOWER COMMISSION REPORT ON THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION'S INVOLVEMENT IN THE IRAN CONTRA AFFAIR
48fc0303 BUT BY LATE IN THE SESSION ISSUES HAD FIRMED AGAIN
48fc0304 <NOISE> MR. EPSTEIN SAID HE SET SOME VERY SHORT RANGE GOALS TO HELP PENRIL GET BACK INTO THE BLACK
48fc0305 <NOISE> HIS PLANS INCLUDE RESTRUCTURING SOME DEBT AND SELLING ONE OF THE COMPANY'S FIVE DIVISIONS TO GENERATE ENOUGH CAPITAL TO FINANCE THE GROWTH OF THE OTHER FOUR
48fc0306 <NOISE> HE DECLINED TO IDENTIFY THE DIVISION THAT WILL BE SOLD
48fc0307 THE LOOK AND FEEL CASES ARE GENERATING CONTROVERSY IN THE INDUSTRY
48fc0308 COMPANIES BRINGING THE SUITS SAY THEY ARE DEFENDING THE REWARDS DUE THOSE WHO DEVELOP INNOVATIVE SOFTWARE FROM COMPANIES THAT ARE SELLING CUT RATE COPIES
48fc0309 BUT OTHERS ARGUE THAT NEW SOFTWARE ALWAYS BORROWS FROM THE OLD
48fc030a THEY SAY LOTUS IF ITS SUIT SUCCEEDS WILL STIFLE INNOVATION AND DISCOURAGE THE SPREAD OF STANDARDS THAT HELP COMPUTER USERS MASTER SOFTWARE MADE BY DIFFERENT COMPANIES
48fc030b CONGRESS GAVE THE SPACE AGENCY'S PLAN MIXED REVIEWS
48fc030c <NOISE> REPRESENTATIVE BILL LOWERY REPUBLICAN OF CALIFORNIA WHO HAS BEEN OUTSPOKEN ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF SECURING A SECOND BOOSTER ROCKET SUPPLIER PRAISED THE PLAN

48fc030i MOREOVER MR. VITALE SAYS IT'S WORTH A PREMIUM TO GET A FOOTHOLD IN THE U. S. MARKET
48fc030j IF YOU ARE IN PUBLISHING THE ONLY MARKET WITH LARGE NUMBERS IS THE ENGLISH SPEAKING MARKET HE SAYS
48fc030k POLITICAL OBSERVERS THEORIZE THAT THE POLITICAL REHABILITATION IS LINKED TO THIS INVISIBLE PRESIDENTIAL RACE
48fc030l SOME SAY FOR INSTANCE THAT MR. DE LA MADRID PUT THE FORMER MINISTER ON DISPLAY TO GOAD OTHER CANDIDATES INTO WORKING HARDER
48fc030m OTHERS SUGGEST THAT ONE PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL IS USING THE POPULAR MR. SILVA HERZOG TO UNDERMINE HIS RIVALS
48fc030n THE MOST PROVOCATIVE HYPOTHESIS HAS IT THAT MR. SILVA HERZOG HAS HIMSELF BECOME A CANDIDATE AGAIN
48fc030o WE ARE AWARE OF OUR INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS AND WE WILLINGLY ACCEPT THEM THE BANKER OBSERVES
48fc030p BUT THE BUNDESBANK HE ASSERTS HAS TO BE VERY CAUTIOUS IN SETTING ITS MONETARY POLICY
48fc030q FROM OUR POINT OF VIEW WE ALREADY HAVE A PERMISSIVE POLICY HE SAYS
48fc030r MR. WRIGHT DIDN'T LIST THOSE EARNINGS ON NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN PERSONAL FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE FORMS
48fc030s ATTORNEY DANIEL SWILLINGER SAID AT A MINIMUM HE SHOULD HAVE DISCLOSED THIS THE SIX THOUSAND AND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR ESCROW AS AN ASSET
48fc030t MR. SWILLINGER COUNSELED REPRESENTATIVE NEWT GINGRICH REPUBLICAN OF GEORGIA ON THE DRAFTING OF A COMPLAINT AGAINST MR. WRIGHT THAT HELPED TOUCH OFF THE ETHICS INVESTIGATION
48fc030u THE ONE ELEMENT OF SUSPENSE REMAINS THE SELECTION OF A RUNNING MATE FOR VICE PRESIDENT BUSH'S PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN

48fc030w REAGAN ARRIVED AT THE CONVENTION SITE LAST NIGHT AND PREPARED FOR HIS FAREWELL SPEECH TO THE PARTY TONIGHT
48fc030x THE PRESIDENT LEAVES FOR CALIFORNIA TOMORROW AND BUSH WILL ARRIVE TO TAKE CONTROL OF THE CONVENTION
48fc030y <NOISE> IT IS A CRUCIAL TIME IN WHICH BUSH MUST ATTEMPT TO MOVE OUT FROM UNDER REAGAN'S SHADOW AND ESTABLISH HIS OWN IDENTITY

48fc031c <NOISE> WHEN THE HOUSE AND SENATE APPROVED THE TAX BILL EARLY SATURDAY LAWMAKERS DIDN'T MENTION THE LAST MINUTE PROVISIONS AND CONGRESSIONAL STAFFERS DESCRIBED THEM AS TECHNICAL
48fc031d WHILE THE ESTIMATED REVENUE OF ALMOST ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OVER THREE YEARS IS RELATIVELY SMALL <NOISE> THE PROVISIONS MIGHT BE PERCEIVED AS AN ANTI TAKEOVER PUSH BY CONGRESS
48fc031e THEY COULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF SLOWING CERTAIN TAKEOVER ACTIVITY CONGRESSIONAL SOURCES ACKNOWLEDGED OVER THE WEEKEND
48fc031f TO BE SURE ON A LOT OF SCORES THE SUMMIT WAS A SUCCESS
48fc031g ECONOMIC COOPERATION WAS ADVANCED WITH BUSINESSMEN SIGNING AGREEMENTS FOR ABOUT THIRTY CONTRACTS AND SEVERAL JOINT VENTURES
48fc031h HUMAN RIGHTS TOO MAY HAVE TAKEN A STEP FORWARD IF MR. GORBACHEV LIVES UP TO HIS PROMISE TO RELEASE ALL POLITICAL PRISONERS BY YEAR'S END

48fc0408 BOTH THE NASDAQ AND AMEX INDEXES SURPASSED RECORDS SET WEDNESDAY
48fc0409 U. S. BANK REGULATIONS ARE ANOTHER STUMBLING BLOCK
48fc040a CURRENTLY BANKS CAN'T OWN MORE THAN NINETEEN POINT NINE PERCENT OF A NON FINANCIAL COMPANY AND CAN ONLY BE PASSIVE INVESTORS
48fc040b UNLESS THESE RESTRICTIONS ARE DROPPED BANKS ARE LIKELY TO BE SWAPPING MAINLY FOR EQUITY IN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
48fc040c THOSE AREN'T ALWAYS APPEALING OR EVEN AVAILABLE
48fc040d MEXICO NATIONALIZED ITS BANKS FIVE YEARS AGO

48fc040r I THINK INDIVIDUALS CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE
48fc040s THE BUDGET HOWEVER WILL NOT MANAGE ITSELF
48fc040t SOME WAY MUST BE FOUND TO PUT IT ON COURSE
48fc040u IN OUR HISTORY AN IMPASSE OVER POLICY HAS BEEN BROKEN OCCASIONALLY BY SOME SORT OF NATIONAL COMMISSION AND IT IS TIME FOR ONE AGAIN
48fc040v SUCH A COMMISSION RESOLVED THE SOCIAL SECURITY PROBLEM EARLIER IN THIS DECADE
48fc040w IN THE JOHNSON YEARS A COMMISSION'S PROPOSALS WERE THE MEANS FOR RESTRUCTURING THE BUDGET
48fc040x STILL EARLIER IT WAS A COMMISSION THAT RECOMMENDED THE CREATION OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM
48fc040y THIS APPROACH ENABLES THE PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS OF CONGRESS TO AVOID SOME FLAK BY MERELY IMPLEMENTING WHAT THE COMMISSION TOLD US TO DO
48fc040z THUS THE BOARD SAID IT WOULD BE RELUCTANT TO GIVE BANK OF NEW YORK MORE THAN ONE EXTENSION OF THE INITIAL NINETY DAYS TO CONSUMMATE THE MERGER

48fc0413 ANALYSTS EXPECT AN INCREASE OF ABOUT FOUR TENTHS OF A PERCENT IN THE APRIL CONSUMER PRICE INDEX ON THE HEELS OF A FIVE TENTHS OF A PERCENT JUMP THE PREVIOUS MONTH
48fc0414 THE PRICE INCREASES ARE EXPECTED PRETTY MUCH ACROSS THE BOARD AS COMMODITIES AND SERVICES ARE RISING AT ABOUT A FOUR PERCENT ANNUAL RATE
48fc0415 BUT THERE IS ALWAYS THE RISK THAT REVIVING A CLASSIC SLOGAN OR SPOKESMAN WILL BACKFIRE AND CREATE AN OLD FASHIONED IMAGE FOR A BRAND
48fc0416 TO GUARD AGAINST THAT MARKETERS TEND TO GIVE THEIR RECYCLED ADS A CONTEMPORARY TWIST
48fc0417 THE CAPTAIN RAID OF NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT FOR EXAMPLE HAS RIPPLING MUSCLES AND A FUTURISTIC LOOK

48gc0302 BUT AS INTEREST RATES RISE IN CANADA THE CANADIAN DOLLAR IS GAINING ON ITS U. S. COUNTERPART TRADERS AND ANALYSTS SAY
48gc0303 AND AS THE CANADIAN UNIT RISES IT LURES MORE FOREIGN INVESTMENT PARTICULARLY FROM JAPAN WHICH ADDS TO ITS STRENGTH

48gc030a <NOISE> WE ARE AWARE OF OUR INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS AND WE WILLINGLY ACCEPT THEM THE BANKER OBSERVES
48gc030b BUT THE BUNDESBANK HE ASSERTS HAS TO BE VERY CAUTIOUS IN SETTING ITS MONETARY POLICY

48gc030f BATTELLE MUST ANTICIPATE COMMERCIAL DEMAND FIVE TO EIGHT YEARS AHEAD MR. SORENSON ADDS
48gc030g PRICES ON THE UPSCALE ACURA DIVISION'S BASE MODEL CARS JUMPED EVEN HIGHER THAN THE HONDA DIVISION'S PRICES

48gc030o TO BE SURE A FEW COMPANIES ARE TRYING TO USE THE OLYMPICS TO MAKE THE TRANSITION FROM A *SUBCONTRACTOR* TO AN INTERNATIONALLY KNOWN BRAND
48gc030p KUKJE CORPORATION SHIFTED FROM PRODUCING NIKE SHOES TO DEVELOPING ITS OWN PRO SPECS LINE OF ATHLETIC SHOES FIVE YEARS AGO
48gc030q IT PAID FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN CASH AND GOODS TO BE AN OFFICIAL SPONSOR OF THE GAMES AND HAS BEEN HIGHLIGHTING THE LOGO IN ITS ADVERTISING
48gc030r KUKJE HOPES THE OLYMPICS WILL HELP GIVE PRO SPECS A FOOTHOLD IN EUROPE
48gc030s VIEWERS AND CRITICS SAY THE HUGE LOAD OF ADS AND AIRTIME IS PART OF THE PROBLEM
48gc030t COMMERCIAL CLUTTER SEEMS GREATER THAN IN PREVIOUS OLYMPICS BROADCASTS MANY CRITICS SAY
48gc030u THE COVERAGE BETWEEN ADS SOME COMPLAIN IS FRAGMENTED AND SHIFTY JUMPING TOO QUICKLY AMONG MYRIAD SPORTS
48gc030v ACTUAL EVENTS AS OPPOSED TO TAPED PROFILES PREVIEWS AND REPORTS TAKE UP LESS THAN HALF OF THE AIRTIME
48gc030w MANY HEADLINE EVENTS DON'T APPEAR UNTIL AFTER MIDNIGHT
48gc030x THE STUDY WAS PART OF CORNELL'S RESPONSE TO CALLS BY LOCAL POLITICIANS THAT IT SHOULD HELP MORE IN TOMPKINS COUNTY
48gc030y WHEN THE SCHOOLS WERE RANKED BY OPERATING BUDGET OR VALUE OF BUILDINGS CORNELL'S ONE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLAR PAYMENTS WERE FOUND TO BE NEAR THE BOTTOM OF THE LIST
48gc030z IN PER STUDENT PAYMENTS CORNELL RANKED SEVENTH AT SEVENTY DOLLARS

48gc0311 ANOTHER TWENTY FIVE PERCENT IS HELD UNDER THE COMPANY'S EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN
48gc0312 MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN THE FORMER CATEGORY ARE EXPECTED TO EXTEND THE NO SELL AGREEMENT FOR ANOTHER YEAR HE SAID
48gc0313 THE LOWER VOLATILITY COULD BE ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW WHEN THE COURSE OF INTEREST RATES SEEMS ESPECIALLY CLOUDY
48gc0314 <NOISE> WHILE INTEREST RATES HAVE BEEN DECLINING RECENTLY MANY ECONOMISTS EXPECT RATES TO RISE BY YEAR END
48gc0315 AFTER THAT HOWEVER THEY SAY RATES COULD FALL AGAIN PERHAPS SHARPLY AS ECONOMIC GROWTH SLOWS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE
48gc0316 JACKSON DEMOCRATS SEE MR. JACKSON AS AN ACTIVIST STRONG LEADER WHO IS MORE WILLING TO TAKE RISKS THAN THOSE IN THE OFTEN BLANDER CONGRESSIONAL WING OF THE PARTY
48gc0317 HE CLEARLY COMMANDS THE DEMOCRATS' MOST LOYAL CONSTITUENCY
48gc0318 IT IS NEVER WISE TO IGNORE THOSE YOU CAN DEPEND ON SAYS SONIA JARVIS OF THE NATIONAL COALITION ON BLACK VOTER PARTICIPATION
48gc0319 <NOISE> IN APRIL DREXEL AGREED TO PAY SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AND PLEAD GUILTY TO SIX FELONY COUNTS RELATED TO A FEDERAL INSIDER TRADING INVESTIGATION
48gc031a <NOISE> THE PLEA AGREEMENT WAS MADE IN CONJUNCTION WITH A BROAD SETTLEMENT OF SECURITIES LAW VIOLATIONS WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
48gc031b BECAUSE THE FIRM AGREED THAT IT COMMITTED FELONIES SECURITIES COMMISSIONERS IN MOST STATES CAN AUTOMATICALLY REVOKE DREXEL'S LICENSE TO DO BUSINESS
48gc031c WHY THIS INCREDIBLE DIVERSION OF EFFORT TO CRIMES THAT OFTEN ARE NOT CLEARLY DEFINED BY STATUTE AND WHERE IDENTIFIABLE VICTIMS ARE SELDOM FOUND
48gc031d MAYBE TOO MANY OF TODAY'S PROSECUTORS WERE INFLUENCED BY THE PREVAILING COUNTERCULTURE SUSPICIONS OF MIDDLE CLASS MORALITY DURING THEIR LAW SCHOOL DAYS
48gc031e <NOISE> BUT ANOTHER ANSWER IS SIMPLER IT IS EASIER TO EXTRACT PLEA BARGAINS FROM TRADERS WITH A MERE MENTION OF R. I. C. O. THAN FROM REAL FELONS
48gc0401 AS A LONGTIME MEMBER OF THE ANAHEIM CALIFORNIA
48gc0402 REDEVELOPMENT COMMISSION THE RETIRED FOOD COMPANY EXECUTIVE TOOK PRIDE IN HELPING HIS CITY GROW
48gc0403 BUT HE ALSO LOVED THE FREE SILVER PASS THAT DISNEYLAND GAVE HIM EVERY YEAR AS ONE OF NEARLY ONE THOUSAND LOCAL NOTABLES SO HONORED
48gc0404 DESPITE ALL THE UNCERTAINTY THAT SURROUNDED BRITISH PETROLEUM'S JUMBO OFFERING THERE WASN'T THAT MUCH TURMOIL IN THE MARKET WHEN SHARES BEGAN TO TRADE FRIDAY
48gc0405 B. P.'S PARTIALLY PAID AMERICAN DEPOSITARY SHARES CLOSED UNCHANGED AT SEVENTEEN AND A QUARTER WITH THIRTEEN POINT TWO MILLION TRADED
48gc0406 <NOISE> IT WAS THE BIG BOARD'S MOST ACTIVE ISSUE
48gc0407 DURING THE PAST SEVERAL DAYS CORPORATIONS AND OTHER BIG INVESTORS HAVE REFRAINED FROM LENDING TREASURY BONDS AND NOTES TO SECURITIES DEALERS FOR BRIEF PERIODS
48gc0408 THAT IN TURN HAS FORCED MANY DEALERS TO REFRAIN FROM SELLING BORROWED SECURITIES OR AMASSING SO CALLED SHORT POSITIONS
48gc0409 IT'S HARD TO SHORT ANYTHING IN THIS MARKET AT THE MOMENT SAID A TRADER AT A LARGE GOVERNMENT SECURITIES DEALER
48gc040a <NOISE> MOST ANALYSTS SAID THE INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS OF THE TWO BANKS MAKE A GOOD FIT
48gc040b GENERALE DE BANQUE HAS A STRONG NETWORK IN AFRICA WHILE AMRO HAS MORE OPERATIONS IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND FAR EAST
48gc040c AND WHILE GENERALE DE BANQUE HAS AN IMPORTANT COMMERCIAL BANKING OPERATION AMRO HAS MORE EXPERIENCE IN BROKERAGE AND INVESTMENT SERVICES FOR ITS CLIENTS
48gc040d THINGS ARE A BIT DULLER THIS YEAR
48gc040e MR. BILZERIAN HAS SENT HIS BOY TO A LITTLE LEAGUE TEAM IN FARAWAY MINNESOTA WHERE THE FAMILY SPENDS ITS SUMMERS AND ISN'T COACHING A TEAM THIS YEAR <NOISE>
48gc040f ALL THE ACTION APPARENTLY WILL BE IN THE COURTROOM
48gc040g IT'S A SITUATION WHERE WE ARE LEARNING OUR WAY FROM THE ALLANTE THE SPOKESMAN SAID
48gc040h THE CAR IS DOING THE THINGS THAT WE WANT IT TO DO FOR US AS FAR AS GETTING VISIBILITY FOR THE DIVISION AND BEING AN IMAGE CAR
48gc040i SINCE IT'S BEEN A NEW ENTITY FOR CADILLAC AND OUR DEALERS WE WEREN'T QUITE SURE WHAT THE ACTUAL SALES VOLUME WOULD BE
48gc040j CAYTON WHO AT AGE SEVENTY HAS BEEN AROUND A BIT LONGER ISN'T QUITE SO SURE

48gc040n APART FROM UNCOOPERATIVE TARGETS THE PAPER AND ITS THIRTY TWO JOURNALISTS FACE A CHALLENGE TO BECOME MORE PROFESSIONAL HE SAYS
48gc040o CRITICIZING SHORTCOMINGS ISN'T ENOUGH
48gc040p WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE ACHIEVEMENTS
48gc040q WE HAVE TO DEVELOP JUDGMENT AND THAT ISN'T EASY
48gc040r <NOISE> MR. CHATICHAI'S WEALTHY FAMILY BACKGROUND AND HIS FAMILY'S LARGE PROPERTY INTERESTS GIVE HIM A GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY
48gc040s <NOISE> FURTHER HE HAS GOOD RELATIONS WITH THE LARGE ETHNIC CHINESE COMMUNITY AND SERVES AS CHAIRMAN OF THE THAI CHINESE FRIENDSHIP ASSOCIATION
48gc040t THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE COUNTRY'S BUSINESS ELITE MANY OF WHOM ARE ETHNIC CHINESE
48gc040u AND IT DOESN'T APPEAR THAT CABLE OWNERS WILL RESIST THE CHANGE
48gc040v A SPOKESMAN FOR THE NATIONAL CABLE TELEVISION ASSOCIATION SAID WE DON'T OPPOSE THE PROPOSAL IN PRINCIPLE
48gc040w WE TAKE THE POSITION THAT THE MORE PEOPLE IN THE CABLE MARKET THE BETTER

48gc0411 BENETTON DENIES ALL CHARGES ON THE SPECIFIC ACCUSATIONS BY UNHAPPY STORE OWNERS AND STEADFASTLY MAINTAINS THAT IT ISN'T A FRANCHISE OPERATION AND THUS ISN'T SUBJECT TO FRANCHISE REQUIREMENTS
48gc0412 STORE OWNERS IT SAYS ARE LICENSEES BECAUSE THEY OWN THEIR STORES AND DON'T PAY ROYALTIES TO BENETTON AS FRANCHISES TYPICALLY DO
48gc0413 ALTHOUGH IT ACKNOWLEDGES THAT A FEW STORE OWNERS HAVE COMPLAINED IT BLAMES ANY PROBLEMS ON THE OWNERS THEMSELVES OR ON ITS FIELD REPRESENTATIVES WHO DEAL DIRECTLY WITH THEM
48gc0414 DESPITE THE PROBLEMS WITH THE CLARIDGE MR. WYNN DIDN'T RULE OUT AN EVENTUAL RETURN TO THE ATLANTIC CITY GAMBLING SCENE
48gc0415 <NOISE> IT'S DISAPPOINTING HE SAID OF THE FAILED PROPOSAL
48gc0416 <NOISE> BUT THIS IS A VERY LIVELY MARKET AND WE HAVEN'T GIVEN UP YET

48gc0418 HE SAYS SALES AT HOME RELATED STORES ARE GROWING NINETY ONE PERCENT FASTER THAN AT DEPARTMENT STORES AND SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT FASTER THAN AT APPAREL STORES
48gc0419 <NOISE> THE TREND IS MAKING THE MARKET LESS DEPENDENT ON HOUSING MARKET CYCLES SAYS CARL STEIDTMANN CHIEF ECONOMIST OF MANAGEMENT HORIZONS DUBLIN OHIO
48gc041a WHILE SECOND QUARTER HOUSING STARTS WERE DOWN THIRTY PERCENT FROM TWO YEARS AGO FURNITURE SALES WERE UP EIGHTEEN PERCENT HE SAYS
48gc041b THESE MIXED FEELINGS OF FRUSTRATION WITH AND GRATITUDE TOWARD THE AUTHORITIES ARE PART OF THE EVERYDAY LIFE OF A FOREIGNER DOING BUSINESS IN KOREA
48gc041c IN FACT SUCH CONTRADICTIONS ARE WHAT SEEM TO MAKE THE KOREAN WORLD GO ROUND
48gc041d A WESTERN BUSINESSMAN NEEDS TO BE READY FOR THEM
48gc041e HERE ARE A FEW HARD LEARNED FACTS OF KOREAN BUSINESS LIFE
48hc0201 <NOISE> MR. GRANT WAS TRAVELING AND UNAVAILABLE FOR COMMENT

48hc0206 IT HAS TRIPLED SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE LARGELY ON TAKEOVER SPECULATION
48hc0207 <NOISE> IT CURRENTLY TRADES AT ABOUT NINE TIMES CASH FLOW SAYS ALAN GAINES OF GAINES BERLAND AN INSTITUTIONAL BROKERAGE FIRM
48hc0208 <NOISE> THAT'S ABOUT A THIRTY PERCENT PREMIUM TO QUALITY OIL COMPANIES LIKE ROYAL DUTCH PETROLEUM EXXON AND MOBIL HE SAYS
48hc0209 <NOISE> TO THESE ENDS K. P. C. ENJOYS A HUGE ECONOMIC ADVANTAGE
48hc020a IT COSTS KUWAIT ABOUT A DOLLAR TO PUMP A BARREL OF OIL AND ANOTHER FIFTY CENTS TO BRING IT TO EUROPE
48hc020b THE PRODUCTION COST OF NORTH SEA OIL BY CONTRAST RUNS BETWEEN EIGHT DOLLARS AND THIRTEEN DOLLARS A BARREL
48hc020c <NOISE> THE BIG DIFFERENCE DISTURBS EUROPEAN OIL MEN
48hc020d THE QUESTION WAS WHAT FORM THIS CONFLICT WOULD TAKE
48hc020e THE CIVIL WAR WAS FINALLY FOUGHT OVER MAINTAINING THE UNION
48hc020f BUT WHAT IF THERE HAD BEEN NO UNION
48hc020g WHAT IF THE SOUTH HAD BEEN A SEPARATE NATION
48hc020h WOULD SOUTHERNERS BLACK OR WHITE HAVE EVER ACHIEVED FULL EQUALITY IF THEY HAD BEEN INCORPORATED INTO THE UNION AS A CONQUERED PROVINCE
48hc020i OR WHAT IF THE WAR HAD BEEN AVOIDED AND SLAVERY JUST DRIFTED ON AND ON
48hc020j WOULD THE SOUTH HAVE BECOME ANOTHER SOUTH AFRICA
48hc020k I WOULDN'T BET AGAINST IT
48hc020l <NOISE> IT STILL ISN'T CLEAR WHAT FORM THE INCREASES WILL TAKE <NOISE> OR WHEN THEY WILL GO INTO EFFECT
48hc020m <NOISE> SOME CARRIERS SAID THEY PLAN TO RAISE FARES SUNDAY AND OTHERS SAID THEY WILL ACT A WEEK LATER
48hc020n SOME AIRLINES ALSO SAID THE INCREASES WON'T AFFECT THEIR LOWEST DISCOUNT FARES
48hc020o IN ADDITION LAURENTIAN SAID BERNHARD M. KOCH THIRTY THREE WAS NAMED VICE PRESIDENT AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER
48hc020p HE SUCCEEDS JOHN STROM WHO TRANSFERRED TO A LAURE- A LAURENTIAN CAPITAL UNIT
48hc020q PREVIOUSLY MR. KOCH WAS DIRECTOR OF INTERNAL AUDIT AT LAURENTIAN GROUP CORPORATION AND IMPERIAL LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY OF CANADA MAJOR SHAREHOLDERS OF LAURENTIAN CAPITAL
48hc020r BUT THEY MAY NOT BE TRYING HARD ENOUGH OR AT LEAST NOT IN THE RIGHT WAYS
48hc020s THEY NEED ONLY LISTEN TO THE GROUP OF EIGHT WOMEN GATHERED HERE FOR A DISCUSSION OF WHAT THEY LIKE AND WHAT THEY DON'T ABOUT THE LATEST TRENDS IN FASHION RETAILING
48hc020t MANUFACTURERS WOULD SWIFTLY LEARN THAT THEIR CLOTHES OFTEN AREN'T RIGHT FOR WOMEN WHO WORK WHILE RETAILERS WOULD FIND THAT THEY HAVEN'T SUFFICIENTLY TAKEN <NOISE> INTO ACCOUNT THEIR CUSTOMERS' BUSY LIVES
48hc020u NEW YORK CITY'S BOARD OF EDUCATION WOULD DISAGREE

48hc020w <NOISE> ALSO MY UNION THE UNITED FEDERATION OF TEACHERS AND EVERY REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRAT WHO HAS EVER RUN FOR PUBLIC OFFICE ANYWHERE
48hc020x AND MOST VEHEMENTLY OF ALL THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS

48hc0216 PHILIP PUCCIO MANAGER OF INSTITUTIONAL TRADING AT DILLON READ AND COMPANY SAID SOME INSTITUTIONS USED THE ADVANCE AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO SOME SELLING
48hc0217 <NOISE> THEY'VE BEEN PEELING OFF SOME STOCK TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF BETTER PRICES HE SAID
48hc0218 DURING THE SPRING AND SUMMER THE FED NUDGED UP SHORT TERM INTEREST RATES TO RESTRAIN THE ECONOMY
48hc0219 BUT WORRIED AS ALWAYS ABOUT BECOMING A POLITICAL FOOTBALL <NOISE> THE FED TRIED TO KEEP A LOW PROFILE IN THE WEEKS BEFORE THE ELECTION
48hc021a THAT STRATEGY WAS HELPED BY AN APPARENT SLOWDOWN IN ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE THIRD QUARTER WHICH EASED INFLATION WORRIES AND ALLOWED THE FED TO STOP PUSHING UP RATES
48hc021b <NOISE> IN THE YEAR EARLIER QUARTER THE LA JOLLA CALIFORNIA INDUSTRIAL AND INVESTMENT CONCERN HAD A RESTATED LOSS OF FIFTY SEVEN MILLION
48hc021c <NOISE> THE RESULTS WERE RESTATED TO REFLECT DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND THE CONSOLIDATION OF ITS SIGNAL LANDMARK HOLDINGS INCORPORATED UNIT A REAL ESTATE DEVELOPER

48hc021f WE'RE NO POWERHOUSE BUT WE'VE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF OUR OPPORTUNITIES SAYS HE
48hc021g IF WE CAN KEEP THAT UP WE'LL BE ALL RIGHT
48hc0301 A SPOKESWOMAN FOR C. B. S. SAID THERE ARE SERIOUS ISSUES AND WE'RE TRYING OUR BEST TO FIND SOLUTIONS WHILE OPERATING IN A VERY DEMANDING ECONOMIC CLIMATE
48hc0302 WE'RE CONTINUING TO BARGAIN
48hc0303 CAPITAL CITIES A. B. C. DECLINED TO COMMENT ON THE TALKS
48hc0304 BROKERAGE STOCKS HAVE BEEN WILTING FOR MONTHS BUT MR. CHANOS THINKS THEY COULD GET HIT LATER THIS YEAR IF OTHER FIRMS REPORT DOWN QUARTERS
48hc0305 SALOMON'S STOCK DIVED ELEVEN PERCENT ON HUGE VOLUME MONDAY CASTING A TEMPORARY PALL OVER THE WHOLE GROUP
48hc0306 IT CLOSED YESTERDAY AT THIRTY NINE AND SEVEN EIGHTHS UP ONE EIGHTH
48hc0307 SOME HAVE CHARACTERIZED OUR COUNTERMEASURES AS PROTECTIONIST BROUGHT ABOUT BECAUSE OF CONGRESSIONAL PRESSURES
48hc0308 THAT IS DEAD WRONG
48hc0309 <NOISE> WE HAVE BEEN IN CONSULTATIONS WITH JAPAN ON THIS ISSUE SINCE NOVEMBER LONG BEFORE THE L- PRESENT TRADE LEGISLATION WAS INTRODUCED
48hc030a THE PRESIDENT'S ACTION WAS THE CULMINATION OF THAT PROCESS AND IT HAD NOTHING WHATSOEVER TO DO WITH TRADE BILLS
48hc030b <NOISE> PRESIDENT REAGAN BELIEVES THAT PEOPLE AND NATIONS SHOULD HONOR THEIR OBLIGATIONS
48hc030c <NOISE> THERE IS NOTHING PROTECTIONIST ABOUT THAT
48hc030d SUCH COST CUTTING EFFORTS HAVE WORSENED LABOR DISPUTES WHICH HAVE IN TURN PITTED NON UNION PILOTS AGAINST PRO UNION PILOTS
48hc030e <NOISE> FIRST OFFICER GUY CASEY WAS ONCE A CAPTAIN AT CONTINENTAL <NOISE> BUT LOST HIS SENIORITY DURING THE BITTER STRIKE THERE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE WHICH HE HAD HELPED TO ORGANIZE
48hc030f HE SAYS HE WANTS TO PUT THE EXPERIENCE BEHIND HIM
48hc030g ANALYSTS ALSO SAID THEY HADN'T EXPECTED LOWER OPERATING PROFITS FOR THE COMPANY'S INDUSTRIES GROUP AND FOR THE BROADCASTING SEGMENT
48hc030h <NOISE> WESTINGHOUSE OFFICIALS TOLD *ANALYSTS* THAT OPERATING PROFIT IN THE INDUSTRIES GROUP FELL FIFTEEN TO TWENTY PERCENT HURT IN PART BY WEAK RESULTS IN CANADIAN OPERATIONS
48hc030i A SHARP DROP IN OPERATING PROFIT FROM THE BROADCASTING GROUP'S PRODUCTION COMPANY CONTRIBUTED TO THE SLIGHTLY LOWER OPERATING EARNINGS OVERALL FOR THAT SEGMENT
48hc030j THE SPOKESMAN ALSO SAID THE LEAGUE'S OWNERS ARE COMMITTED TO PLAYING WITH THEIR CURRENT REPLACEMENT ROSTERS FOR THE REST OF THE SEASON INCLUDING THE SUPER BOWL IF NECESSARY
48hc030k THAT MAY BE THE CASE IF MR. UPSHAW CAN BE TAKEN AT HIS WORD
48hc030l <NOISE> HE HAS SAID THAT THE PLAYERS WILL REMAIN ON STRIKE FOR THE DURATION IF THE UNION'S OFFER WAS REJECTED
48hc030m THE SOVIETS OBVIOUSLY WANT TO MAKE IT AS DIFFICULT AS POSSIBLE FOR NATO TO CARRY OUT ITS MODERNIZATION SAID ONE WESTERN DIPLOMAT IN BONN
48hc030n A SENIOR NATO DIPLOMAT ACCUSED THE SOVIETS OF TRYING TO SEDUCE THE GERMANS AWAY FROM US
48hc030o <NOISE> IT IS NONE TOO SUBTLE WEDGE DRIVING HE TOLD REUTERS
48hc030p WE'VE NEVER HAD ONE BEFORE MR. TIMBERS SAID
48hc030q A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF OUR CLIENTS WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THAT OPTION
48hc030r IT'S NOT NECESSARILY A MARKET CALL
48hc030s MR. TIMBERS SAYS HE'S FAIRLY AMBIVALENT AB:OUT THE PRICE OF GOLD NEAR TERM
48hc030t HE DOES SEE HOWEVER HIGHER INFLATION OF FIVE PERCENT OR SO IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE UP FROM FOUR PERCENT THIS YEAR
48hc030u A GOLD OPTION COULD BE A NICE ALTERNATIVE FOR FIXED INCOME INVESTORS SHOULD INF:LATION FEARS ARISE MR. TIMBERS SAYS
48hc030v <NOISE> SOME ECONOMISTS SAY INFLATIONARY PRESSURES COULD CONTINUE TO PUSH UP U. S. INTEREST RATES THIS YEAR
48hc030w <NOISE> IF SO FOREIGN CENTRAL BANKS MAY SEE THAT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO TIGHTEN UP AND TO ADDRESS THEIR OWN INFLATION WORRIES DESPITE U. S. CONCERN
48hc030x ONE FEAR SAYS IRVING TRUST ECONOMIST ROBERT MCGEE IS THAT HIGHER GLOBAL RATES WILL SEND THE FINANCIAL MARKETS INTO A TAILSPIN
48hc030y <NOISE> A SIMILAR VIEW IS HELD BY GRETA E. MARSHALL INVESTMENT MANAGER OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC EMPLOYEES' RETIREMENT SYSTEM WHICH MANAGES ABOUT FORTY FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS
48hc030z I STILL SEE NO EVIDENCE THAT INFLATION IS PICKING UP SUBSTANTIALLY SHE SAYS
48hc0310 <NOISE> THE ECONOMY DOESN'T LOOK SO STRONG <NOISE> THAT IT WILL REKINDLE INFLATION SO I WOULD VIEW ANY FURTHER DROP IN BOND PRICES AS A BUYING OPPORTUNITY
48hc0311 <NOISE> ALAS THEY PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE DEVOTED A LITTLE MORE THOUGHT TO WINNEBAGO'S PAST
48hc0312 THE COMPANY HAD A HISTORY OF CARNAGE AT THE TOP RUNNING THROUGH FIVE DIFFERENT CHIEF EXECUTIVES IN THE FOURTEEN YEARS BEFORE MESSRS.
48hc0313 GILBERT AND BERRETH STROLLED INTO TOWN

48hc0316 TO MAKE THEM DIRECTLY COMPARABLE EACH INDEX IS BASED ON THE CLOSE OF NINETEEN SIXTY NINE EQUALING ONE HUNDRED
48hc0317 THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE IS SINCE YEAR END
48hc0318 <NOISE> AFTER NEARLY EIGHT YEARS OF THE REAGAN PRESIDENCY A KIND OF MORNING AFTER MOOD PREVAILS HERE
48hc0319 THERE IS A SENSE THAT MR. REAGAN'S SUCCESSOR HASN'T ANY CHOICE BUT TO BE A CONSOLIDATION PRESIDENT
48hc031a GIVEN BUDGET CONSTRAINTS AND A RE ENERGIZED CONGRESS SOME HERE BELIEVE A BUSH ADMINISTRATION MAY NOT BE ALL THAT DIFFERENT FROM A DUKAKIS ADMINISTRATION
48hc031b SOME OF THAT CASH HAS BEEN USED FOR BONUS PAYMENTS
48hc031c WAGES AND BONUSES ROSE NINETEEN PERCENT IN THE FIRST HALF A RATE THAT FAR OUTPACED ECONOMIC GROWTH AND EXERTED UPWARD PRESSURE ON PRICES
48hc031d <NOISE> CHINA'S ECONOMY GREW AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF FIVE POINT SEVEN PERCENT IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS ROUGHLY HALF THE AVERAGE ANNUAL RATE IN THE PAST DECADE

48hc0404 <NOISE> THE BANKS SOUGHT TO ELIMINATE A MISMATCH BETWEEN THEIR ASSETS PREDOMINANTLY HELD IN NON POUND CURRENCIES AND THEIR CAPITAL KEPT IN POUNDS
48hc0405 WHEN THE POUND WAS WEAK DURING THE EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTIES THE VALUE OF SCANDINAVIAN BANK'S CAPITAL FELL STEEPLY IN PROPORTION TO ITS NON DOLLAR ASSETS
48hc0406 THE BANKS THAT OWNED SCANDINAVIAN BANK HAD TO INJECT ABOUT FORTY SEVEN POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS OF ADDITIONAL CAPITAL
48hc0407 ALSO THE STRONG RISE IN SHARE PRICES IN RECENT WEEKS APPEARS TO HAVE DISCOUNTED MOST OF THE GOOD NEWS LIKELY IN THE BUDGET ANOTHER DEALER SAID
48hc0408 IT IS GOING TO TAKE QUITE A LOT TO MOVE IT SHARPLY AHEAD FROM THIS LEVEL HE SAID
48hc0409 THE ONE HUNDRED SHARE INDEX IS UP EIGHTEEN POINT SIX PERCENT THIS YEAR
48hc040a THE BOOK HE SAYS WILL BE ABOUT ARVIDA AND GENERALLY ABOUT COMPANIES SNARED IN THE TAKEOVER GAME
48hc040b IT WILL ASK SOME POINTED QUESTIONS IS THERE VALUE ADDED IN CORPORATE MERGERS
48hc040c DOES PRODUCTIVITY INCREASE AND WHAT HAPPENS TO THE PEOPLE INVOLVED
48hc040d <NOISE> THE PREMIER SAID IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR MR. G- GHAFAR TO REMAIN AS HIS DEPUTY
48hc040e I HAVE TRUST IN HIM
48hc040f I CHOSE HIM DIDN'T I
48hc040g DOCTOR MAHATHIR SAID
48hc040h S. D. I. PERPETUATES THE ILLUSION THAT MORE WEAPONS EQUALS MORE SECURITY
48hc040i OUR DEPENDENCE UPON VIOLENCE TO RESOLVE CONFLICT IS A SHORT RUN SOLUTION TO A LONG TERM PROBLEM
48hc040j IN ORDER TO ENSURE OUR SURVIVAL WE MUST CHANGE THE WAY WE THINK ABOUT CONFLICT
48hc040k BY SPENDING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON DEVELOPING NONVIOLENT MEANS OF RESOLVING CONFLICT WE CAN BUILD A WORLD BEYOND WAR AND A SUSTAINABLE SECURE FUTURE FOR ALL PEOPLE
48hc040l STEVEN M. KINCAID PRESIDENT SAID KINCAID'S BOARD WOULD REVIEW THE ANNOUNCEMENT WHEN IT MEETS SOMETIME IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS
48hc040m HE DECLINED TO COMMENT FURTHER

48hc040q BUT AT LEAST THE MARKET DIDN'T CRASH
48hc040r GEMFIBROZIL HAS LONG BEEN KNOWN TO INCREASE H. D. L. BUT UNTIL THIS REPORT ITS EFFECT ON HEART DISEASE WAS UNCLEAR
48hc040s UNAVAILABLE IN THE U. S. SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO GEMFIBROZIL GAINED ONLY LIMITED USE
48hc040t THAT IS BECAUSE GEMFIBROZIL ONLY MODERATELY REDUCES L. D. L. COMPARED WITH OTHER DRUGS
48hc040u IN EXPERT LED ELECTRICAL AND COMPUTER MAKERS KYOCERA SLIPPED NINETY TO FIVE THOUSAND AND TWENTY
48hc040v MATSUSHITA ELECTRIC INDUSTRIAL WAS UNCHANGED AT TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTY

48hc040y CERTAIN ELEMENTS OF A NATIONAL SYSTEM WERE OBVIOUS AND QUICKLY MADE THEIR WAY INTO USE

48ic0309 THE THIRD REVIEW WAS DUE BY OCTOBER THIRD NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
48ic030a THE MOST OPTIMISTIC ESTIMATES ARE NOW THAT IT WILL START SOMETIME AFTER THE FIRST OF THE YEAR
48ic030b THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION IN SHORT IS CONSPIRING WITH THE SOVIETS TO VIOLATE THE REVIEW PROVISIONS OF THE TREATY
48ic030c NO ONE SEEMS QUITE SURE HOW THE PUBLISHER JUGGLES HIS ASSETS AMONG HIS VARIOUS COMPANIES WHICH INCLUDE THE PUBLICLY OWNED MAXWELL COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND VARIOUS PRIVATE ONES

48ic030g THE ASSOCIATION SAID FIFTY SEVEN PERCENT PREDICTED NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT WILL BE BETTER THAN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN WHILE ONLY THIRTEEN PERCENT EXPECTED A WORSE YEAR

48ic030l REGARDLESS OF HOW THE FOREIGN PURCHASES BEGIN THEY O- OFTEN INVOLVE THE VERY PARTS THAT MAKE WEAPONS PERFORM
48ic030m FOR EXAMPLE F. M. C. CORPORATION'S BRADLEY FIGHTING VEHICLE DEPENDS ON A SOPHISTICATED SENSOR SYSTEM FROM THE NETHERLANDS TO INFORM SOLDIERS OF POTENTIAL THREATS AND TARGETS

48ic030q THAT MOVE IS BEHIND CHRYSLER'S RECENT DECISIONS TO INCREASE PRODUCTION WHICH IN TURN WILL BOOST PROFIT FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR
48ic030r THE CUOMO PLAN DOESN'T STOP AT GOUGING NEW YORK TAXPAYERS AND LONG ISLAND RATEPAYERS
48ic030s FEDERAL TAXPAYERS ALSO WILL CONTRIBUTE
48ic030t THE KEY TO THE DEAL IS THAT LILCO ALSO WOULD GET A TWO POINT FIVE BILLION TAX WRITE OFF FOR SHOREHAM
48ic030u THIS WOULD GUARANTEE THAT THE UTILITY WON'T HAVE TO PAY ANY FEDERAL TAXES FOR AT LEAST A DECADE
48ic030v NEW YORK ALSO WOULD HELP LILCO FLOAT A HUNDRED MILLION IN TAX EXEMPT INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT BONDS TO HELP PAY FOR THE CLEANUP

48ic0315 IN ANOTHER TRADE DISPUTE KANSAI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT CORPORATION HAS COME UNDER ATTACK
48ic0316 JAPAN INSISTS THE COMPANY WHICH IS IN CHARGE OF A NEW AIRPORT AT OSAKA IS PRIVATE AND NOT SUBJECT TO MINISTRY ORDERS
48ic0317 FOREIGNERS SAY THAT IS A SEMANTIC ARGUMENT BECAUSE NEARLY FOUR FIFTHS OF THE COMPANY'S EXECUTIVES HAIL FROM GOVERNMENT MINISTRIES
48ic0318 THREE YEARS AGO WHEN THE MOSLEM LEAGUE CAME INTO THE SHARED POWER ARRANGEMENT MR. IJAZ ALI GOT INTO THE PROVINCIAL ASSEMBLY
48ic0319 THERE HE WRUNG THOUSANDS OF RUPEES FROM THE GOVERNMENT TO BUILD ROADS SCHOOLS AND ELECTRIFICATION SYSTEMS IN HIS DISTRICT

48ic031d ADD IN THE HOUSEHOLDS INVOLVED IN SERVICES FOR THE MILITARY AND NEARLY TEN PERCENT OF THE NATION'S HOUSEHOLDS ARE INVOLVED
48ic031e U. S. INTELLIGENCE ABOUT THE TERRORISTS IS CONSIDERED POOR
48ic031f IT HAS PROVEN DIFFICULT TO INFILTRATE SMALL TERRORIST CELLS WHICH OFTEN ARE HELD TOGETHER BY FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS
48ic031g AND DURING THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES LEBANESE TERRORISTS KILLED TWO OF THE CENTRAL INTELLIGEN(CE)- AGENCY'S TOP MIDDLE EAST OPERATIVES ROBERT AMES AND WILLIAM BUCKLEY
48ic0401 AS MODEST AS THE MEASURES ARE EVEN THEY WON'T BE ADOPTED WITHOUT A STRUGGLE
48ic0402 THE TAX CUTS ACCEPTED BY THE COALITION PARTIES HAVE BEEN LINKED TO CUTBACKS IN FEDERAL SUBSIDIES
48ic0403 SUCH REDUCTIONS COULD RILE SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS AND UNDERMINE PARLIAMENTARY SUPPORT FOR THE ENTIRE TAX PROGRAM

48ic040b THE PHILIP MORRIS MAGAZINE ENJOYS BY FAR THE HIGHEST CIRCULATION OF ANY COMPANY MAGAZINE SEVEN POINT TWO MILLION COPIES
48ic040c THE ONLY REQUIREMENT IS THAT YOU HAVE TO BE AN ADULT TO RECEIVE THE MAGAZINE SAYS MARY TAYLOR ASSOCIATE PUBLISHER
48ic040d THAT'S NOT BECAUSE OF RACY ARTICLES BUT BECAUSE THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF TRYING TO SNATCH TWELVE AND THIRTEEN YEAR OLDS
48ic040e PHILIP MORRIS IS EVEN CONSIDERING SELLING SPACE TO OUTSIDE ADVERTISERS IT ALREADY RAN AN AD FOR TIME MAGAZINE ON A TEST BASIS IN ITS WINTER NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN ISSUE

48ic040p A BIG PART OF THE REASON FOR WOOD'S SUCCESS IS THE NEW TECHNIQUES DEVELOPED OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS FOR WOOD PANELS WITH A STEEL CORE

48jc030k A SPOKESMAN FOR MR. BACOT SAYS THIS A LOT HAS HAPPENED IN BANKING AND THE FINANCIAL MARKETS IN THE INTERVENING YEARS
48jc030l THE RELEVANCE OF THESE COMMENTS TO TODAY'S CIRCUMSTANCES ISN'T VERY GREAT
48jc030m MR. REAGAN VIGOROUSLY DEFENDED ATTORNEY GENERAL EDWIN MEESE WHO IS UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR HIS ROLE IN ADVANCING A MIDDLE EAST OIL PIPELINE <NOISE> ADVOCATED BY ONE OF MR. MEESE'S FRIENDS
48jc030n MR. REAGAN SAID HE COULDN'T REMEMBER BEING TOLD ANYTHING ABOUT THE PIPELINE <NOISE> AND EXPRESSED EVERY CONFIDENCE IN MR. MEESE'S INTEGRITY
48jc030o HE ALSO CRITICIZED THE LYNCH MOB ATMOSPHERE THAT HAS ACCOMPANIED INVESTIGATIONS OF HIS AIDES
48jc030p IN TWO SELECTED AREAS THE STATE WILL ALLOW PROCUREMENT AND RETAIL PRICES TO RISE TO WHAT THE OPEN MARKET DEMANDS
48jc030q THE SUBSIDY FOR CONSUMERS IS MEANT TO REDUCE THE STRAIN ON URBAN RESIDENTS
48jc030r FARMERS OF COURSE WILL GET HIGHER PRICES FOR THEIR GRAIN FROM THE MARKET WHICH IN TURN SHOULD INDUCE THEM TO INCREASE PRODUCTION
48jc030s GRAIN PRODUCTION THROUGHOUT CHINA HAS FALTERED IN RECENT YEARS IN PART BECAUSE STATE PROCUREMENT PRICES WERE TOO LOW
48jc030t MEANWHILE SHARE PRICES CLOSED HIGHER IN SYDNEY HONG KONG WELLINGTON SEOUL AND MANILA AND WERE LOWER IN SINGAPORE
48jc030u TRADING WAS DESCRIBED AS LIGHT TO MODERATE
48jc030v THE TAIPEI MARKET WAS CLOSED
48jc030w GRAINS AND SOYBEANS THE THREAT OF RAIN AND FAVORABLE SPRING PLANTING CONDITIONS PUSHED SOYBEAN AND CORN FUTURES PRICES LOWER
48jc030x THE LATEST WEATHER FORECAST CALLS FOR FAIRLY GOOD MOISTURE IN MIDWEST FARMING STATES OVER THE NEXT SIX TO TEN DAYS
48jc030y ANALYSTS SAID TRADERS ARE SHIFTING THEIR EMPHASIS AWAY FROM LAST YEAR'S CROP <NOISE> AND TO THIS YEAR'S
48jc030z <NOISE> <NOISE> WITH THIS YEAR'S SMALL ACREAGE INCREASES WEATHER AND SPRING PLANTING CONDITIONS ARE MAJOR CONCERNS TO A MARKET THAT IS BEGINNING TO SHAKE OFF A HUGE SURPLUS
48jc0310 THE FAVORABLE CONDITIONS HELPED THE SOYBEAN CONTRACT FOR NOVEMBER SETTLEMENT CLOSE AT SIX POINT EIGHT TWO TWO FIVE DOLLARS A BUSHEL DOWN NINE POINT FIVE CENTS
48jc0311 ANOTHER EXECUTIVE EXPLAINS THE PROBLEMS AS THE OPPOSITE OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
48jc0312 LAST YEAR YOU HAD TUMULTUOUS SWINGS IN THE MARKETS THEMSELVES HE SAYS
48jc0313 THIS YEAR THE ENVIRONMENT WILL BE NARROWER SWINGS BUT VOLUME WILL BE LOWER WITH REVENUES INSUFFICIENT TO COVER COSTS
48jc0314 <NOISE> MORE IMPORTANT THAN ARITHMETIC HOWEVER IS MR. JACKSON'S MESSAGE
48jc0315 SPEAKING TO BLACK ASPIRATIONS HE REPRESENTS THE BEST OF THE AMERICAN DREAM
48jc0316 HE MIGHT EVEN QUALIFY AS A SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE IF NOT FOR HIS ENDORSEMENT OF HOMOSEXUAL RIGHTS
48jc0317 ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE GENERAL STRIKE FACTORIES CLOSED BUT BOOKSTORES REMAINED OPEN IN THIS OLD WORLD CULTURAL CENTER
48jc0318 MOST SCHOOLS WERE SHUT BUT PUSHKIN STREET NEAR THE SQUARE REVERBERATED AS USUAL WITH THE SOUND OF BADLY PLAYED CHOPIN EMANATING FROM THE OPEN WINDOWS OF THE MUSIC ACADEMY
48jc0319 <NOISE> MANY OF THE ARMENIAN DEMANDS ARE CULTURAL
48jc031a THEY WANT THEIR OLD FLAG REINSTATED THEIR CHILDREN SENT TO ARMENIAN SCHOOLS RATHER THAN RUSSIAN ONES THEIR OWN LANGUAGE USED ON OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS
48jc031b THEIR POLITICAL DEMANDS INCLUDE CALLS FOR A SEPARATE ARMY BRIGADE AND THE RIGHT FOR ARMENIA TO HAVE CONSULATES ABROAD
48jc031c <NOISE> <NOISE> THE STUDY WAS PART OF CORNELL'S RESPONSE TO CALLS BY LOCAL POLITICIANS <NOISE> THAT IT SHOULD HELP MORE IN TOMPKINS COUNTY

48jc0408 THIS IS SERIOUS STUFF HERE SAYS TOM SCHREYER TWENTY FOUR ADMIRING ONE CONTESTANT
48jc0409 SHE'S GOT TATTOOS AND EVERYTHING
48jc040a <NOISE> <NOISE> STILL SECURITIES AND BANKING REGULATORS WORRY WHETHER THEY ARE ACTING FAST ENOUGH TO SAFEGUARD AGAINST GROWING RISKS IN THE WORLD'S FINANCIAL MARKETS
48jc040b MANY AGREE THERE IS LITTLE TIME TO WASTE IN THE SCRAMBLE TO CREATE BETTER INTERNATIONAL REGULATION
48jc040c AS MR. FELDSTEIN SAYS YOU CAN'T JUST LOOK AT THE BUILDING AND SAY IT HASN'T FALLEN DOWN YET SO WE SHOULD BE SAFE
48jc040d WITH THE INITIAL FINANCING COMPLETE L. S. I. LOOKED ABROAD IN FEBRUARY NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO FOR ITS NEXT INFUSION
48jc040e WE DECIDED TO GO TO INVESTORS WHO'D PAY A HIGHER PRICE EXPLAINS MR. CORRIGAN
48jc040f AT THE TIME EUROPEANS WERE CLAMORING TO INVEST IN U. S. HIGH TECHNOLOGY AND HAD FEW OPPORTUNITIES TO PARTICIPATE DIRECTLY IN GOOD DEALS HE SAYS
48jc040g <NOISE> IF WE LOOK AT THE RECORD THE DEBATE SHOULD BE RATHER SHORT
48jc040h THE WINNERS OBVIOUS
48jc040i THE ONLY TRAGEDY AND IT'S AN AMAZING ONE IS THAT MOST AMERICANS DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED AND HOW IT CAME ABOUT
48jc040j BUT INSIDE ROOM SEVEN ONE THREE THE JAPANESE SEE THE SITUATION SOMEWHAT DIFFERENTLY
48jc040k THEY REASON LIKE THIS IF THE U. S. IMPOSES SANCTIONS THEY MOST LIKELY WILL BE AIMED AT JAPANESE CONSTRUCTION COMPANIES DOING BUSINESS IN THE U. S.
48jc040l BUT THAT WOULD HURT THOUSANDS OF AMERICAN WORKERS WHO ARE EMPLOYED EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY BY SUCH COMPANIES
48jc040m THE POLITICAL FALLOUT FOR THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION MIGHT BE TOO GREAT TO RISK THAT
48jc040n TORONTO BASED P. C. L. MAKES PACKAGING AND FURNITURE
48jc040o ROBERT J. TWEEDY ITS PRESIDENT SAID THE COMPANY IS LOOKING AT OPTIONS BUT HE DECLINED TO COMMENT FURTHER
48jc040p MR. TWEEDY AND THOMAS N. DAVIDSON CHAIRMAN OWN NINETEEN PERCENT OF P. C. L.'S FIVE POINT THREE MILLION SHARES OUTSTANDING
48jc040q <NOISE> <NOISE> MR. TANAKA WAS AMONG THE FIRST SCIENTISTS TO RECOGNIZE THE POTENTIAL OF SUPERCONDUCTORS <NOISE> WHICH ARE SUBSTANCES THAT CAN CARRY ELECTRICITY WITH NO RESISTANCE AND THUS NO LOSS OF POWER
48jc040r <NOISE> IF MADE PRACTICAL THEY COULD BRING SPECTACULAR CHANGES TO ALMOST ANY ELECTRICAL PRODUCT OR PROCESS
48jc040s <NOISE> THAT COULD MEAN VASTLY FASTER AND MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT PRODUCTS SUCH AS COMPUTERS CARS AND HOUSEHOLD APPLIANCES
48jc040t BUT UNTIL THE RECENT BREAKTHROUGH SUPERCONDUCTORS HAD TO BE CHILLED AT A HOPELESSLY LOW TEMPERATURE TO WORK SO EXCEPT FOR A FEW APPLICATIONS THERE REALLY WAS NO TECHNOLOGY
48jc040u MR. IACOCCA SAID THAT WHILE PRICING ACTIONS INCREASED SALES THEY ALSO SQUEEZED CHRYSLER'S PROFIT MARGINS
48jc040v BUT HE ADDED THAT THE NUMBER THREE U. S. AUTO MAKER MADE A CONSCIOUS DECISION TO SACRIFICE PROFITS FOR A HIGHER MARKET SHARE
48jc040w THAT MOVE IS BEHIND CHRYSLER'S RECENT DECISIONS TO INCREASE PRODUCTION WHICH IN TURN WILL BOOST PROFIT FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR
48jc040x <NOISE> CRITICS AGREE THAT HE MAY BE OVERLY OPTIMISTIC THOUGH
48jc040y AND MR. DUKAKIS IS CERTAIN TO FACE MORE PRESSURE ON THE QUESTION FROM *VICE* PRESIDENT BUSH WHO SUPPORTS BOTH THE M. X. AND MIDGETMAN
48jc040z MOREOVER MOST OF THE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS BEING CONSIDERED AS POTENTIAL RUNNING MATES FOR GOVERNOR DUKAKIS HAVE BACKED ONE OR MORE MISSILE PLANS
48jc0410 THE DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION BILL PENDING IN CONGRESS IS EXPECTED TO PUT OFF ANY DECISION TO- UNTIL A NEW ADMINISTRATION TAKES OFFICE NEXT YEAR
48jc0411 STILL MR. LOVE THINKS HE HAS THE WORST BEHIND HIM
48jc0412 PERMIAN HAS BOTTOMED OUT HE SAYS BUT HE'S USING INTERGROUP'S INVESTMENT BANKERS TO SOUND OUT PROSPECTIVE BUYERS ANYWAY
48jc0413 TO BOLSTER THE BALANCE SHEET HE'S ALSO ATTEMPTING TO REACH AGREEMENT LATER THIS YEAR TO SELL TO JAPAN'S N. K. K. THE OTHER HALF OF ITS STEEL HOLDINGS
48jc0414 F. P. L. SAID THE ACQUISITION WOULD BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS A POOLING OF INTERESTS
48jc0415 TURNER OWNS ABOUT TWELVE THOUSAND ACRES IN SOUTHWEST FLORIDA TEN THOUSAND OF WHICH ARE CITRUS GROVES
48jc0416 F. P. L. SAID THE ACQUISITION INCREASES ITS CITRUS ACREAGE TO TWENTY TWO THOUSAND
48jc0417 BASIC ENGINEERING DESIGN AND SITE PREPARATION STUDIES <NOISE> ARE TO START THIS WINTER
48jc0418 CONSTRUCTION IS TO START IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE PROVIDED THE PROJECT REMAINS ECONOMICALLY ATTRACTIVE
48jc0419 PRODUCTION IS TO START IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX
48jc041a MR. TAYLOR WILL REMAIN PRESIDENT A POST HE HAS HELD SINCE MAY FIRST
48jc041b HE ALSO HAS SERVED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR AS CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER THAT POSITION WILL BE ELIMINATED NEXT TUESDAY

48kc0203 ONE POSSIBLE GOAL A REGIONAL CONSORTIUM TO HELP PROP UP LAND PRICES
48kc0204 VIRTUALLY EVERYBODY IN THE BUSINESS COMPLAINS ABOUT TOO MANY AWARDS AND MOST BIG AGENCIES TRY TO ENTER ONLY THE FIVE OR TEN MOST PRESTIGIOUS CONTESTS
48kc0205 YET EVEN THE MOST VEHEMENT CRITICS KEEP ON COMPETING
48kc0206 IF YOU DON'T IT LOOKS LIKE YOU AREN'T GOOD ENOUGH TO WIN COMPLAINS ROY GRACE THE CHAIRMAN OF THE NEW YORK AGENCY GRACE AND ROTHSCHILD
48kc0207 YOU HAVE TO PLAY THE GAME
48kc0208 CLEVELAND CONFRONTED SCANDALS SWIFTLY AND WITH UNCOMMON CANDOR CONCEDING FROM THE OUTSET FOR EXAMPLE HIS AFFAIR WITH MARIA HALPIN ONCE IT WAS EXPOSED
48kc0209 YET HE WENT TO GREAT LENGTHS TO CONCEAL HIS CANCER SURGERY
48kc020a MR. REAGAN ON THE OTHER HAND EXPOSED HIS MALIGNANT BOWELS TO THE NATION BUT ONLY GRUDGINGLY TOOK RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE IRAN CONTRA FIASCO
48kc020b MEANWHILE THE AGENCY SAID IT WILL CONDUCT A STUDY ON ITS OWN
48kc020c OFFICIALS SAID THE REVIEW MAY LEAD TO NEW REGULATIONS FOR DATA PROCESSING SYSTEMS
48kc020d THE AGENCY MAY ALSO CHALLENGE PAST CHARGES TO THE PENTAGON
48kc020e PENTAGON OFFICIALS SAY THE REVIEW LIKELY WILL TAKE AT LEAST A YEAR
48kc020f WHILE OTHER OPEC MEMBERS RECOGNIZE THE ADVANTAGE OF GOING DOWNSTREAM MOST LACK KUWAIT'S MONEY SMALL POPULATION AND ABILITY TO MOVE FAST

48kc020n THE SURVEY'S COMPOSITE INDEX FELL TO FIFTY EIGHT POINT NINE PERCENT IN NOVEMBER FROM OCTOBER'S SIXTY ONE POINT EIGHT PERCENT
48kc020o A FIGURE ABOVE FIFTY PERCENT INDICATES THAT THE ECONOMY IS GENERALLY EXPANDING
48kc020p NOVEMBER MARKS THE SIXTEENTH CONSECUTIVE MONTH OF EXPANSION
48kc020q TRADING THIS WEEK MAY INDICATE THE MARKET'S DIRECTION WITH THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIALS NEAR THE OCTOBER NINETEENTH LOW
48kc020r LAST WEEK STOCK PRICES WERE SENT TUMBLING BY SKITTISH INVESTORS MANY OF WHOM ARE CONCERNED WITH STAGFLATION
48kc020s BOND PRICES FELL FRIDAY
48kc020t I THINK MR.

48kc020y THE THREE TWO MEN AND A WOMAN REPORTEDLY WERE PLANNING A BOMB ATTACK ON A MILITARY PARADE TODAY IN THE BRITISH COLONY
48kc020z THIS MAY TURN OUT TO BE AN EXTREMELY POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE ALL OF THE TOBACCO MANUFACTURERS WERE INVOLVED IN THE ALLEGED CONSPIRACY MR. DAYNARD SAID
48kc0210 THERE IS A LOT OF DAMNING EVIDENCE
48kc0211 NOW THE JURY CAN CONSIDER ALMOST ALL THE EVIDENCE THAT CAME IN ABOUT DEFENDANTS' ATTEMPTS TO STONEWALL AND DENY
48kc0212 THE FLIPPERS APPARENTLY WAITED THE TWO WEEKS THEN DUMPED THEIR SHARES WHEN TRADING OPENED IN THE STOCK
48kc0213 THE FLIPPERS IN THE INDUSTRY WERE HUNGRIER TO DO THIS THAN EXPECTED AN EXECUTIVE CLOSE TO THE DEAL SAYS
48kc0214 THEY WERE ABLE TO BORROW MONEY
48kc0215 ANALYSTS SAY THERE IS A STRONG CHANCE THAT KAO WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF AN EARLIER U. S. ACQUISITION
48kc0216 LAST YEAR IT BOUGHT HIGH POINT NORTH CAROLINA BASED HIGH POINT CHEMICAL CORPORATION FOR AN UNDISCLOSED SUM
48kc0217 HIGH POINT PRODUCES RAW MATERIALS FOR TOILETRY AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS
48kc0218 I HAVE NEVER SOUGHT EITHER WILLFULLY OR OTHERWISE TO EVADE INCOME TAX MR. SEOW SAID
48kc0219 MR. SEOW SAID IN AN INTERVIEW YESTERDAY THAT IF CONVICTED HE COULD FACE A PRISON SENTENCE
48kc021a HE REPEATED HIS VOW TO STAND FOR PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS EXPECTED LATER THIS YEAR
48kc021b WHY NOT FARMERS RESPOND
48kc021c WE HAVEN'T SEEN THESE PRICES BEFORE SAYS DAVID GUSTAFSON AN EATON COLORADO BEAN GROWER
48kc021d HE STILL HAS HALF OF LAST YEAR'S HARVEST IN STORAGE EVEN THOUGH HE WILL START HARVESTING THIS YEAR'S CROP THIS WEEK
48kc021e I WANTED TO SPECULATE HE EXPLAINS
48kc0301 WHILE ALL WEST GERMAN POLITICAL PARTIES AGREED ON THE NEED FOR TAX CUTS OF ABOUT TWENTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS THEY DIFFER ON WHO SHOULD BENEFIT
48kc0302 THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATS AND THE LEFT WING GREENS WANT THE CUTS TO HELP THE POOR AND THE WORKING CLASS
48kc0303 WITHIN THE RULING COALITION THE LIBERAL FREE DEMOCRATS AND THE BAVARIAN SISTER PARTY OF THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS THE CHRISTIAN SOCIALISTS WANT CUTS SPREAD ACROSS THE BOARD
48kc0304 MR. FUNARO DESCRIBED AS HOT AIR AND NONSENSE FOREIGN BANKERS' LANGUAGE IN THEIR CRITICISM OF BRAZIL'S LACK OF ECONOMIC POLICY
48kc0305 HE SAID NOBODY WORRIED ABOUT BRAZIL'S HIGH INFLATION WHEN THE COUNTRY WAS PRODUCING BIG SURPLUSES TO MEET DEBT PAYMENTS
48kc0306 <NOISE> INSTEAD OF LOOKING FOR EXCUSES HE SAID THESE BANKS SHOULD REALIZE THERE'S A DEBT CRISIS AND IT HAS TO BE RESOLVED BY BOTH SIDES
48kc0307 KIDDER PEABODY WAS FINED TWENTY FIVE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS BY THE S. E. C. TO SETTLE INSIDER TRADING AND OTHER CHARGES
48kc0308 THE PENALTY IS SECOND ONLY TO IVAN BOESKY'S ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR FINE LAST FALL
48kc0309 KIDDER'S SETTLEMENT THE FIRST BY A MAJOR FIRM IN THE INSIDER TRADING SCANDAL WILL ALLOW THE G. E. SUBSIDIARY TO ESCAPE CRIMINAL PROSECUTION
48kc030a EVEN SO GLORIA HAS ALREADY GIVEN UP HOPE
48kc030b I HEAR THAT ONLY PEOPLE WITH MONEY WILL BE APPROVED SHE SAYS
48kc030c MY MOTHER TELLS HER IT ISN'T TRUE TO BE PATIENT
48kc030d THE FIRM DOLLAR ALSO BOOSTED PRICES IN ZURICH AND ENCOURAGED SELECTIVE BUYING BY FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC INVESTORS DEALERS SAID
48kc030e SOME FINANCIAL CHEMICAL AND OTHER INDUSTRIAL STOCKS HAD THE BIGGEST GAINS
48kc030f BANKS ALSO ENDED MOSTLY HIGHER
48kc030g MEANWHILE MR. SILVA HERZOG BORROWED A FRIEND'S UNMARKED OFFICE IN CENTRAL MEXICO CITY AND DISCREETLY RECEIVED VISITORS
48kc030h HE TURNED DOWN JOB OFFERS FROM COMPANIES AND INTERNATIONAL LENDING AGENCIES BUT ACCEPTED LECTURING ENGAGEMENTS ABROAD
48kc030i HE THOUGHT ABOUT OPENING A U. S. LATIN AMERICA STUDIES CENTER IN MEXICO CITY OR SETTING UP A CONSULTING FIRM
48kc030j WHAT HAPPENS NOW
48kc030k THAT DEPENDS ON TWO THINGS WHETHER MANAGEMENT CAN GAIN THE TRUST OF THE WORKERS AND WHETHER UNION LEADERS CAN CONTROL THE RANK AND FILE
48kc030l IT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD ON EITHER COUNT
48kc030m INDEED LABOR EXPERTS SAY THERE IS ONLY A SLIM CHANCE THAT SOUTH KOREA CAN LAY A FOUNDATION FOR LABOR RELATIONS THAT MIGHT CALM WORKER UNREST SOON
48kc030n TURNOUT IS ANOTHER UNKNOWN FACTOR
48kc030o TO CAPITALIZE HERE GOVERNOR DUKAKIS WOULD LIKE TO SEE A HEAVY TURNOUT ESPECIALLY IN SUCH POCKETS OF STRENGTH AS THE CHICAGO LAKEFRONT AND SUBURBS <NOISE>

48kc0312 HE'S VERY OUTSPOKEN
48kc0313 <NOISE> LAWRENCE SUMMERS ECONOMIC ADVISER TO GOVERNOR DUKAKIS URGES THAT EVEN THE BEST FIGURES PROVIDE A DISCOURAGING PICTURE OF THE ECONOMY

48kc0315 BUT THE PACE IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES HAS BEEN NEGATIVE BY MY PREFERRED MEASURE AND GLACIAL BY ANY OTHER
48kc0316 STILL THE NEURAL NETWORK REPRESENTS A REMARKABLE CONCEPTUAL LEAP IN THE COMPUTER WORLD
48kc0317 IT IS A CRITICAL BUILDING BLOCK IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE MUCH AS THE NEURONS IN HUMANS ARE THE VEHICLE FOR BRAIN FUNCTION
48kc0318 THE NETWORK HAS ALLOWED RESEARCHERS TO CREATE THE FIRST CONVINCING LIKENESS OF THE BRAIN IN AREAS SUCH AS MEMORY AND VISION
48kc0319 DESPITE THE PROBLEMS WITH THE CLARIDGE MR. WYNN DIDN'T RULE OUT AN EVENTUAL RETURN TO THE ATLANTIC CITY GAMBLING SCENE
48kc031a IT'S DISAPPOINTING HE SAID OF THE FAILED PROPOSAL
48kc031b BUT THIS IS A VERY LIVELY MARKET AND WE HAVEN'T GIVEN UP YET
48kc031c THE KREMLIN WHICH LONG DENIED THAT THERE WERE POLITICAL PRISONERS HERE NOW CONCEDES THEY DO EXIST
48kc031d THE MOST RECENT OFFICIAL SOVIET ESTIMATES PUT THE TOTAL BETWEEN TWELVE AND TWENTY NINE
48kc031e MOSCOW DEFINES POLITICAL PRISONERS AS PEOPLE SENTENCED UNDER TWO ARTICLES OF THE SOVIET CRIMINAL CODE THAT MAKE BEHAVIOR LOOSELY DEFINED AS ANTI SOVIET A CRIMINAL OFFENSE
48kc031f BOTH ARTICLES OF THE CODE WERE WIDELY USED IN LOCKING UP DISSIDENTS IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES
48kc0401 <NOISE> AD AGENCIES IN THE PAST HAVE TYPICALLY RECEIVED AS COMMISSIONS FIFTEEN PERCENT OF AN ADVERTISER'S BILLINGS THE TOTAL COST OF PLACING ADS

48kc0403 AYER HAD NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE BILLINGS OF EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY SIX POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS
48kc0404 THE DIET IS A ONE HOUSE LEGISLATURE APPORTIONED BY DISTRICT RATHER THAN POPULATION LIKE THE SENATE AS OPPOSED TO THE HOUSE
48kc0405 THIS MEANS THAT JAPANESE FARMERS HAVE TREMENDOUS CONTROL OVER JAPANESE POLITICS
48kc0406 FOOD PRICES IN JAPAN TAKE FORTY PERCENT OR MORE OF THE AVERAGE PERSON'S WAGE
48kc0407 WITH HOUSING TAKING ANOTHER FORTY PERCENT AND THE FACT THAT THE JAPANESE ARE GREAT SAVERS THEY ARE LEFT WITH ALMOST NO DISCRETIONARY INCOME
48kc0408 THIS IS WHY THEY CANNOT DEVELOP A DOMESTIC MARKET
48kc0409 THEY DON'T HAVE MONEY TO SPEND EXCEPT A SMALL AMOUNT OF SAVINGS THAT THEY SPEND ONLY ON SPECIAL OCCASIONS OR FOR UNUSUAL BARGAINS
48kc040a CRAY ALREADY HAS SOLD TWO OF THE NEW COMPUTERS

48kc040h IN RECENT MONTHS THE QUOTA PROGRAM ITSELF HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY CONTROVERSIAL
48kc040i SOME BIG U. S. STEELMAKERS WHICH SELL SEMIFINISHED STEEL IN THE DOMESTIC MARKETPLACE ARE FIGHTING TO CONTINUE QUOTAS AFTER THEIR SCHEDULED EXPIRATION SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH
48kc040j OTHERS THOUGH DEPENDENT ON OUTSIDE SUPPLIES OF SEMIFINISHED ARE PUSHING TO END QUOTAS <NOISE>
48kc040k IF THE EXTRADITION EFFORT FAILS THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT LOSES MORE THAN THE CHANCE TO PROSECUTE A KEY SUSPECT

48lc0205 AGENCIES GENERALLY DON'T USE UNDERCOVER TESTERS POSING AS PROSPECTIVE TENANTS AS THEY DO IN RACE DISCRIMINATION COMPLAINTS THEY FEAR THAT THE TESTER COULD BE ATTACKED
48lc0206 INSTEAD THEY TRY TO BUILD CASES ON THE TESTIMONY OF CURRENT AND FORMER TENANTS
48lc0207 HAD THAT HAPPENED THE FAILED BANKS WOULD HAVE BEEN TURNED OVER TO THE F. D. I. C. FOR DISPOSITION
48lc0208 IN MOST CASES THE AGENCY SELLS THE FAILED BANK TO ANOTHER INSTITUTION ALONG WITH THE GOOD LOANS
48lc0209 THE F. D. I. C. PURCHASES THE BAD LOANS AND TRIES TO SALVAGE WHATEVER IT CAN
48lc020a FOR INVESTORS THE PARTNERSHIPS ARE ONLY AS ATTRACTIVE AS THE UNDERLYING BUYOUTS
48lc020b MANY IN THE FIELD CONTEND THAT THE BUYOUTS BEING PUT TOGETHER THESE DAYS ARE GENERALLY OVERPRICED BECAUSE OF SEVERAL FACTORS
48lc020c AMONG THEM TOO MUCH CAPITAL CHASING TOO FEW GOOD CANDIDATES WHICH HAS PUSHED COSTS UP AND RETURNS DOWN TO WHAT THEY SEE AS UNACCEPTABLE LEVELS
48lc020d THE REVIEW COMMITTEE TRIES TO OFFER A MENU OF SMALL MEDIUM AND LARGE CAPITALIZATION STOCKS
48lc020e SOME OF ITS MOST SUCCESSFUL PICKS WERE QUITE SMALL COMPANIES WHEN FIRST RECOMMENDED
48lc020f MONEY MANAGERS MINDING BILLION DOLLAR PORTFOLIOS ON THE OTHER HAND OFTEN AVOID SM:ALLER STOCKS BECAUSE THEY CAN'T PURCHASE A SIGNIFICANT STAKE WITHOUT AFFECTING THE PRICE
48lc020g THE DOLLAR'S SLIPPAGE CAME DESPITE MORE COMMENTS FROM TREASURY SECRETARY JAMES BAKER AIMED AT SUPPORTING IT
48lc020h IN A TELEVISION INTERVIEW MR. BAKER SAID THE U. S. AND ITS TOP SIX ECONOMIC ALLIES ARE PREPARED TO ACT TO STABILIZE THE DOLLAR AROUND THE CURRENT LEVELS
48lc020i LAST WEEK THE TREASURY SECRETARY WARNED IN A SPEECH THAT A CONTINUED DECLINE IN THE U. S. CURRENCY'S VALUE COULD BE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE
48lc020j THOSE CREDITORS INCLUDE MULTILATERAL AGENCIES LATIN AMERICAN AND SOME EUROPEAN GOVERNMENTS AND SHORT TERM COMMERCIAL BANK CREDITORS AND SUPPLIERS
48lc020k <NOISE> PERU RECENTLY RESUMED DEBT PAYMENTS TO THE INTER AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
48lc020l <NOISE> BUT THERE AREN'T ANY CURRENT PLANS TO RESUME PAYMENTS TO THE WORLD BANK OR THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND THE ADVISER SAID
48lc020m <NOISE> AS A RESULT OF THIS NEW CONTRACT THE PALMDALE FACILITY WILL REOPEN IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT WITH EMPLOYMENT PEAKING AT ONE THOUSAND IN ABOUT NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE
48lc020n ANOTHER ONE THOUSAND EMPLOYEES WILL BE WORKING ON THE SHUTTLE AT ROCKWELL'S DOWNEY CALIFORNIA FACILITY
48lc020o <NOISE> ONLY FIVE HUNDRED NEW JOBS IN TOTAL WILL BE CREATED
48lc020p EDWARD KENNEDY A ROCKWELL SPOKESMAN SAID MANY OF THOSE WORKING ON THE SHUTTLE IN PALMDALE WILL BE THOSE CURRENTLY CONSTRUCTING B. ONE B. AIRCRAFT
48lc020q A DIGITAL SPOKESMAN SAID THE COURT ACTION DOESN'T CHANGE THE <NOISE> STATUS QUO
48lc020r <NOISE> THE PART OF THE RULING THAT WAS OVERTURNED HASN'T BEEN IN EFFECT SINCE LAST JANUARY WHEN EMULEX OBTAINED THE STAY HE SAID
48lc020s <NOISE> HE ADDED THAT THE PARAGRAPHS OF THE ORDER THAT WERE UPHELD CONTINUE TO PROHIBIT EMULEX FROM USING TRADE SECRETS THAT DIGITAL SAYS WERE STOLEN FROM IT
48lc020t MR. PRENDERGAST ALSO ADMIRES NOMURA'S PERSEVERANCE
48lc020u THEY'VE BEEN CALLING ON US FOR ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS AND DIDN'T GENERATE ANY BUSINESS FOR THE FIRST TEN HE SAYS
48lc020v THEIR PERSISTENCE AND THE WEALTH OF JAPAN AND THE FLOWS OF CAPITAL FROM JAPAN HAVE PAID OFF FOR THEM
48lc020w PEOPLE THOUGHT WE'D SIT BACK AND JUST ENJOY THE HOLIDAYS SAID EDWARD P. NICOSKI MARKET STRATEGIST AT PIPER JAFFRAY AND HOPWOOD INC. MINNEAPOLIS
48lc020x BUT WE'RE SEEING SOME STRONG BUYING HERE
48lc020y WE'RE SEEING A WHOLE BUNCH OF STOCKS BREAKING OUT OF THEIR TRADING RANGES
48lc020z THE SOVIETS OBVIOUSLY WANT TO MAKE IT AS DIFFICULT AS POSSIBLE FOR NATO TO CARRY OUT ITS MODERNIZATION SAID ONE WESTERN DIPLOMAT IN BONN
48lc0210 A SENIOR NATO DIPLOMAT ACCUSED THE SOVIETS OF TRYING TO SEDUCE THE GERMANS AWAY FROM US
48lc0211 IT IS NONE TOO SUBTLE WEDGE DRIVING HE TOLD REUTERS
48lc0212 BUT AT ANOTHER OPERATION IN RURAL NORTH ILLINOIS THERE ARE HARDLY ANY MINORITIES TO DRAW FROM
48lc0213 WE PICKED THAT LOCATION BECAUSE WE NEEDED THE RIVER ACCESS THERE TO BE SUCCESSFUL MR. THOMPSON SAYS
48lc0214 I KNOW I HAVE A SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
48lc0215 BUT I ALSO HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO MY SHAREHOLDERS
48lc0216 CHAMPION SAID ABOUT TWENTY ONE HUNDRED WORKERS STRUCK ITS FIVE LUMBER AND PLYWOOD PLANTS IN THE REGION OVER THE WEEKEND
48lc0217 STAMFORD CONNECTICUT BASED CHAMPION HAS FOURTEEN SUCH PLANTS NATIONWIDE THE SPOKESMAN SAID
48lc0218 THE INTERNATIONAL WOODWORKERS OF AMERICA AND THE WESTERN COUNCIL OF INDUSTRIAL WORKERS UNION STRUCK TWO CHAMPION MILLS WHERE THE CONTRACT RECENTLY EXPIRED ACCORDING TO A CHAMPION SPOKESMAN
48lc0219 PICKET LINES ERECTED BY THOSE STRIKERS QUICKLY CLOSED THE OTHERS WHERE CONTRACTS EITHER HAVE EXPIRED OR WILL EXPIRE BY JULY THIRTY FIRST HE ADDED
48lc021a TOBACCO HEIRESS DORIS DUKE AGREED TO POST FIVE MILLION NEEDED BY IMELDA MARCOS TO SECURE BAIL ON RACKETEERING CHARGES
48lc021b DUKE IS THE DAUGHTER OF THE FORMER PRESIDENT OF AMERICAN TOBACCO COMPANY MARCOS AND HER HUSBAND THE DEPOSED PRESIDENT OF THE PHILIPPINES ARE ACCUSED OF LOOTING MANILA'S TREASURY
48lc021c HIS ARRAIGNMENT HAS BEEN DELAYED
48lc021d MR. JORDAN WAS AWARDED DAMAGES OF NEARLY EIGHT THOUSAND AND A PUNITIVE AWARD OF FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND
48lc021e THE JURY ALSO FOUND THAT CLAYTON UNDER MISSOURI COMMON LAW HAD BREACHED ITS FIDUCIARY DUTIES BECAUSE OF SELF DEALING
48lc021f THE APPEALS COURT UPHELD THE LOWER COURT IN OCTOBER NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT
48lc0301 THE STATUTE ALLOWS FOR A GREAT DEAL OF LATITUDE AGREES ARTHUR CHRISTY THE FIRST SPECIAL PROSECUTOR APPOINTED UNDER THE NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT LAW
48lc0302 IN PAST INVESTIGATIONS HE NOTES THE FOCUS HAS BEEN QUITE NARROW
48lc0303 BUT IN EACH CASE HE SUGGESTS IT'S UP TO THE COUNSEL HE CERTAINLY HAS THE POWERS
48lc0304 ALSO THE STRONG RISE IN SHARE PRICES IN RECENT WEEKS APPEARS TO HAVE DISCOUNTED MOST OF THE GOOD NEWS LIKELY IN THE BUDGET ANOTHER DEALER SAID
48lc0305 IT'S GOING TO TAKE QUITE A LOT TO MOVE IT SHARPLY AHEAD FROM THIS LEVEL HE SAID
48lc0306 THE HUNDRED SHARE INDEX IS UP EIGHTEEN POINT SIX PERCENT THIS YEAR
48lc0307 SOME TIRE EXECUTIVES SUCH AS JOHN J. NEVIN CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF FIRESTONE TIRE AND RUBBER COMPANY SAY MR. STONE UNDERSTANDS THE INDUSTRY'S PROBLEMS
48lc0308 BUT MR. STONE'S UNION CRITICS AREN'T SO GENEROUS
48lc0309 THEY SAY HE HAS BEEN LAX ABOUT ORGANIZING NEW MEMBERS FOR EXAMPLE
48lc030a UNDER THE AGREEMENT SUBJECT TO REGULATORY APPROVAL YPSILANTI SHAREHOLDERS WOULD RECEIVE ONE POINT NINE THREE FIVE SHARES OF TRUSTCORP COMMON FOR EACH COMMON SHARE OF YPSILANTI
48lc030b TRUSTCORP SAID IT PLANS TO COMPLETE THE PURCHASE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER
48lc030c YPSILANTI SAVINGS BANK HAS ABOUT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT MILLION IN ASSETS
48lc030d TRUSTCORP INC. IS A HOLDING COMPANY WITH ASSETS OF FOUR POINT SIX BILLION
48lc030e CRITICS OF INDEXING CHARGE THAT THE APPROACH LACKS IMAGINATION AND AMOUNTS TO SETTLING FOR MEDIOCRITY
48lc030f <NOISE> ADVOCATES REPLY THAT INDEXING MEANS LOWER MANAGEMENT FEES THAN THOSE OF ACTIVELY MANAGED BOND FUNDS
48lc030g ALSO INDEXING IN RECENT YEARS OFTEN HAS PRODUCED SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER RESULTS THAN MANY ACTIVE MANAGERS
48lc030h BUT JOHN SMALE P. AND G'S CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE USED THE MEETING TO SPEAK AT LENGTH ABOUT HOSTILE TAKEOVERS IN GENERAL
48lc030i HE MAINTAINED THAT TOO OFTEN THEY LEAVE COMPANIES LOADED WITH DEBT AND SHRUNKEN RESEARCH BUDGETS AND IGNORE THE INTERESTS OF EMPLOYEES AND THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH THE COMPANIES DO BUSINESS
48lc030j <NOISE> HE ALSO ARGUED THAT OVER THE LONG RUN HOSTILE TAKEOVERS DON'T NECESSARILY PROVIDE A GOOD MECHANISM FOR SHAREHOLDERS TO REALIZE FULL VALUE FOR THEIR SHARES
48lc030k A FRENCH PRESS REPORT SAID THE EXPORTS INCLUDE SOPHISTICATED EQUIPMENT FOR MAKING SEMICONDUCTORS
48lc030l IT SAID THE MACHINERY MAY HAVE HELPED THE SOVIETS BUILD ADVANCED COMPUTER MEMORIES FOR SUCH MILITARY PURPOSES AS MISSILE GUIDANCE
48lc030m <NOISE> WESTERN NATIONS HAVE REACHED AGREEMENTS INTENDED TO FORBID EXPORTS OF SUCH EQUIPMENT TO THE SOVIETS
48lc030n <NOISE> WHEN STOCKS ARE RISING PORTFOLIO INSURERS DON'T HEDGE AND INSTEAD RIDE THE MARKET HIGHER
48lc030o WHEN STOCKS ARE FALLING PORTFOLIO INSURERS SELL STOCK INDEX FUTURES IN EFFECT CUSHIONING THE VALUES OF THEIR STOCK PORTFOLIOS FROM THE FULL BRUNT OF A DROPPING MARKET
48lc030p THE IDEA ACCORDING TO WALL STREET PROPONENTS IS TO PROVIDE PROTECTION AT A LOW COST
48lc030q AS A MANAGER MR. O'MALLEY CONCEDES HE PUSHES SUBORDINATES TO WORK LONG AND HARD HOURS IF NECESSARY
48lc030r BUT AS A BOSS I PICK MY SPOTS TO BE TOUGH HE ADDS
48lc030s I ALSO LIKE TO LET PROFESSIONALS SHOW HOW GOOD THEY CAN BE ON THEIR OWN
48lc030t DECEMBER DELIVERY GOLD SETTLED AT FOUR EIGHTY TWO SEVENTY FOR A DECLINE OF TWELVE EIGHTY
48lc030u DECEMBER SILVER FELL THIRTY THREE POINT THREE CENTS TO SIX POINT SIX FOUR FIVE
48lc030v JANUARY PLATINUM WAS DOWN THIRTEEN SIXTY TO FOUR NINETY FORTY
48lc030w YESTERDAY PEOPLE CLOSE TO FEDERATED'S BOARD SAID THAT THE COMPANY WAS STILL OPEN TO YET ANOTHER FRIENDLY MERGER PROPOSAL FROM CAMPEAU
48lc030x <NOISE> IF THEY'VE GOT SOMETHING TO SHOW US WE'LL TAKE A LOOK AT IT
48lc030y THEY KNOW WHERE TO FIND US SAID ONE SOURCE
48lc030z WE'RE NOT STONEWALLING THEM
48lc0310 CAR SALES APPARENTLY HAVE LEVELED OFF AFTER DISAPPOINTING RESULTS EARLY IN THE YEAR FOLLOWED BY A SHARP UPTICK IN LATE JANUARY
48lc0311 BIGGER INCENTIVES FUELED THE REBOUND AND HAVE HELPED SUSTAIN THE SALES PACE
48lc0312 CHRYSLER CORP. FOR EXAMPLE BOOSTED CASH REBATES TO TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS ON SOME MODELS
48lc0313 GIVEN THE NATURE OF OUR OWNERSHIP IT'S OBVIOUSLY A VERY COMPLEX ISSUE MR. ELISH SAID
48lc0314 THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS TO CONSIDER AND WE'RE LOOKING AT IT
48lc0315 <NOISE> BUT NOTHING IS IMMINENT
48lc0316 IT DOES NOT HOWEVER SEEM REASONABLE TO THE GERMANS WHO ARE INSTEAD MULLING A TAX INCREASE TO SHORE UP A LEAKY GOVERNMENT BUDGET
48lc0317 AS FOR THE U. S. COMMENTS ON GERMAN INFLATION A TYPICAL GERMAN MIGHT RESPOND ZERO INFLATION
48lc0318 WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT
48lc0319 GENERALLY THERE'S NO LIMIT ON HOW MUCH OF THEIR FUNDS EMPLOYEES CAN BORROW IF THEIR ACCOUNTS TOTAL TEN THOUSAND OR LESS
48lc031a FOR LARGER ACCOUNTS EMPLOYEES ARE RESTRICTED TO BORROWING HALF THE TOTAL BUT NO MORE THAN FIFTY THOUSAND
48lc031b <NOISE> LOANS MUST BE REPAID WITHIN FIVE YEARS UNLESS THE MONEY GOES TOWARD BUYING A PRINCIPAL RESIDENCE IN WHICH CASE LONGER REPAYMENT TERMS CAN BE ARRANGED
48lc031c BORROWED FUNDS AREN'T TAXED
48lc031d BUT A WITHDRAWAL IS TREATED AS TAXABLE INCOME AND IS SUBJECT TO AN ADDITIONAL TEN PERCENT PENALTY TAX
48lc0401 LIKE DREXEL MR. ICAHN HAS BEEN SUBPOENAED IN CONNECTION WITH THE GOVERNMENT'S CONTINUING INVESTIGATION OF THE BOESKY SCANDAL
48lc0402 <NOISE> A SUBPOENA IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION AND DOESN'T IMPLY ANY WRONGDOING
48lc0403 MR. ICAHN'S LAWYERS AT WEIL GOTSCHAL AND MANGES IN NEW YORK SAID THE INVESTIGATION HAD ABSOLUTELY NO CONNECTION WITH THE WITHDRAWAL OF MR. ICAHN'S BID
48lc0404 BUT MR. GIBBS IS HOPEFUL THAT MANY TAXPAYERS WILL ACCEPT
48lc0405 AMONG OTHER INCENTIVES THE NEW TAX LAW PHASES OUT THE DEDUCTIBILITY OF INTEREST PAYMENTS TO THE I. R. S.
48lc0406 <NOISE> THE I. R. S. ALSO HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN TAX COURT CHALLENGES TO PEOPLE INVOLVED IN TAX SHELTERS
48lc0407 WE'RE WINNING MORE THAN WE'RE LOSING THE I. R. S. CHIEF POINTS OUT
48lc0408 DOUBLEDAY ALSO PROVIDED BERTELSMANN WITH MUCH NEEDED U. S. BOOK MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS
48lc0409 MOREOVER MR. VITALE SAYS IT'S WORTH A PREMIUM TO GET A FOOTHOLD IN THE U. S. MARKET
48lc040a IF YOU ARE IN PUBLISHING THE ONLY MARKET WITH LARGE NUMBERS IS THE ENGLISH SPEAKING MARKET HE SAYS
48lc040b MANY PEOPLE HOWEVER CLAIM THAT IRRESPONSIBLE OWNERS NOT THE DOGS THEMSELVES ARE TO BLAME FOR THE HIGH INCIDENCE OF ATTACKS
48lc040c THEY'RE AMORAL SAYS AN OFFICIAL OF THE UNITED KENNEL CLUB A PRESTIGIOUS PEDIGREE ASSOCIATION
48lc040d THEY'LL DO WHAT THE TRAINER ALLOWS THEM TO DO
48lc040e K. MART AND BRUNO'S SAID THEIR HYPERMARKETS WHICH HAVEN'T BEEN NAMED YET WILL INCLUDE SPECIALTY SHOPS
48lc040f THE FACILITIES WILL COVER ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND SQUARE FEET OR THREE TIMES THE SPACE OF THE AVERAGE K. MART DISCOUNT DEPARTMENT STORE
48lc040g LOCATED IN MAJOR METROPOLITAN AREAS THEY WILL BE !TOTALLY DISTINCT FROM THE CURRENT OPERATIONS OF BOTH COMPANIES A PREPARED STATEMENT SAID
48lc040h THE FIRST IS EXPECTED TO OPEN NEXT YEAR
48lc040i WHAT'S MORE A FURTHER DROP IN THE DOLLAR COULD HAVE THE VERY RESULT MR. BAKER SEEKS TO AVOID HIGHER INTEREST RATES
48lc040j IN ORDER TO KEEP PERSUADING FOREIGN INVESTORS TO HOLD CHEAPER DOLLARS THE FEDERAL RESERVE MUST KEEP U. S. INTEREST RATES HIGHER THAN THOSE ABROAD
48lc040k AN EVEN WEAKER DOLLAR COULD REQUIRE HIGHER RATES
48lc040l UNDER TERMS OF THE ORIGINAL AGREEMENT COMPUTER MEMORIES WOULD HAVE ISSUED NEW SHARES OF ITS OWN EXCHANGE FOR SHARES OF CLOSELY HELD HEMDALE
48lc040m CURRENT HEMDALE HOLDERS THEN WOULD HAVE OWNED ABOUT SEVENTY EIGHT PERCENT OF COMPUTER MEMORIES' SHARES
48lc040n THE SURVIVING COMPANY WOULD HAVE BEEN NAMED HEMDALE FILM CORP. AND JOHN DALY HEMDALE'S CURRENT CHAIRMAN WOULD HAVE BECOME CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE SURVIVING COMPANY
48lc040o A SPOKESMAN FOR CRAY DESCRIBED THE M. I. T. DECISION AS GOOD NEWS
48lc040p <NOISE> ASSUMING THE BIDDING DOES OPEN UP AGAIN IT MEANS THERE'S ROOM FOR TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND NOT CONSIDERATIONS BASED PURELY ON PRICE
48lc040q <NOISE> THE SPOKESMAN SAID IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE FOR CRAY TO INSTALL AND OPERATE A COMPLETE SUPERCOMPUTER SYSTEM AT THE PRICES M. I. T. WANTED TO PAY
48lc040r WITH TECHNOLOGY LIKE THIS THE COMPANY THAT INVENTED THE OVERNIGHT EXPRESS BUSINESS FOURTEEN YEARS AGO STILL DOMINATES IT
48lc040s <NOISE> FEDERAL EXPRESS COLLECTS MORE THAN HALF THE REVENUE IN WHAT IS NOW MORE THAN A SIX BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY
48lc040t <NOISE> AND AT A TIME WHEN DETERIORATING SERVICE IS A NATIONAL MALADY THIS COMPANY CLAIMS TO DELIVER MORE THAN NINETY NINE PERCENT OF ITS LETTERS AND PACKAGES ON TIME
48lc040u HOUSING STARTS TOTALED ONE MILLION SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY FOUR THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED UNITS LAST YEAR UP TWENTY TWO POINT SEVEN PERCENT FROM NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
48lc040v IN DECEMBER ALONE STARTS ROSE TWENTY POINT EIGHT PERCENT TO ONE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE UNITS
48lc040w THAT MARKED THE TWENTIETH CONSECUTIVE MONTHLY INCREASE
48lc040x EARLY FEBRUARY NORTH AMERICAN BUILT CAR SALES EDGED UP ZERO POINT THREE PERCENT ACCORDING TO FIGURES REPORTED LAST WEEK
48lc040y THAT TRANSLATES INTO A SEASONALLY ADJUSTED ANNUAL RATE OF EIGHT POINT ONE MILLION VEHICLES COMPARED WITH A SEVEN POINT SEVEN MILLION RATE A YEAR EARLIER
48lc040z THIS WEEK'S MID FEBRUARY REPORT ON CAR SALES WILL TELL WHETHER THAT PACE WAS BEING MAINTAINED
48lc0410 OF COURSE TO A GREAT EXTENT THE STOCK PRICES OF THE VARIOUS COMPANIES THAT WILL BE REPORTING HIGHER EARNINGS ALREADY REFLECT SHAREHOLDER EXPECTATIONS
48lc0411 THAT OBVIOUSLY WILL MUTE THE PRICE MOVEMENT OF ANY PARTICULAR STOCK WHEN THE COMPANY REPORTS ITS EARNINGS UNLESS ANALYSTS' ESTIMATES ARE SERIOUSLY OUT OF KILTER
48lc0412 <NOISE> AS PORTFOLIO STRATEGISTS PUZZLE OVER THE MARKET IMPACT OF THIS WAVE OF GOOD NEWS THEY COME UP WITH SOME SHARPLY DIVERGENT OPINIONS
48lc0413 AFTER LARRY SPEAKES LOST HIS JOB WITH MERRILL LYNCH I WAS A LITTLE RELUCTANT TO JOIN THE POSSE OF CRITICS
48lc0414 YOU HATE TO KICK A GUY WHEN HE'S DOWN
48lc0415 <NOISE> BUT SOMETHING MADE ME CHANGE MY MIND
48lc0416 I READ HIS BOOK
48lc0417 MONARCH CAPITAL ROSE TWO TO FORTY ONE AND THREE QUARTERS
48lc0418 THE COMPANY WHICH IS IN THE PROCESS OF BUYING ONE MILLION OF ITS COMMON SHARES SAID IT WILL PURCHASE ANOTHER ONE MILLION SHARES
48lc0419 MONARCH HAS ABOUT SEVEN POINT TWO MILLION SHARES OUTSTANDING
48lc041a OVERALL CONSUMER SPENDING HAS SLOWED SINCE LAST YEAR'S STOCK MARKET CRASH BUT IT'S STILL AT A LEVEL THAT WORRIES SOME ECONOMISTS
48lc041b CONSUMER CREDIT SLOWED SHARPLY IN JULY REFLECTING SLUGGISH SALES
48lc041c TOO MUCH SPENDING AT HOME COUPLED WITH HEAVY DEMAND FOR EXPORTS COULD OVERLOAD AN INDUSTRIAL SECTOR THAT IS ALREADY RUNNING NEAR CAPACITY
48lc041d THE FRONT PAGE OF THE THIRD SECTION DISPLAYS THE DAY'S TOP NEWS FROM EQUITY CREDIT AND OTHER MARKETS IN THE U. S. AND ABROAD
48lc041e YOUR MONEY MATTERS HAS BEEN MOVED TO THIS PAGE
48lc041f <NOISE> ALSO APPEARING THERE ARE MARKETS DIARY AND INVESTMENT INSIGHTS TWO GRAPHIC SUMMARIES OF MARKET TRENDS
48mc0201 THE INTERNATIONAL SECURITY AND DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION ACT OF NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE DIRECTED THE PRESIDENT TO APPOINT A TASK FORCE ON PROJECT ECONOMIC JUSTICE FOR CENTRAL AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN
48mc0202 CONGRESS CHARGED THE GROUP WITH DEVELOPING A PLAN FOR THE EXPANDED USE OF EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLANS AS A MEANS OF BROADENING THE CAPITAL OWNERSHIP BASE THERE
48mc0203 MR. REAGAN NAMED SENIOR DIPLOMAT AND FINANCIER J. WILLIAM MIDDENDORF THE SECOND THE FORMER U. S. AMBASSADOR TO THE ORGANIZATION OF AMERICAN STATES AS CHAIRMAN
48mc0204 THE SYSTEM ISN'T HUNDRED PERCENT PERFECT BUT IT'S WORKING REASONABLY WELL A FOREIGN MINISTRY OFFICIAL TOLD REPORTERS
48mc0205 THE OFFICIAL SAID THE U. S. HAS BEEN SIMILARLY REASSURED
48mc0206 EVEN SO THE U. S. HAS INDICATED THAT IT WANTS JAPAN TO TAKE BETTER CARE OF HOW JAPANESE TECHNOLOGY IS SOLD AROUND THE WORLD
48mc0207 LAST MONTH AUTO SALES FELL ONE POINT FOUR PERCENT AFTER RISING FIVE POINT SEVEN PERCENT IN AUGUST <NOISE>
48mc0208 SALES OF BUILDING MATERIALS INCREASED ONE POINT TWO PERCENT AFTER A ZERO POINT FOUR PERCENT DROP
48mc0209 OVERALL SALES OF DURABLE GOODS WHICH ARE INTENDED TO LAST THREE YEARS OR MORE FELL ZERO POINT NINE PERCENT AFTER RISING THREE POINT ONE PERCENT IN AUGUST
48mc020a <NOISE> MERRILL'S STOCK ROSE THREE AND THREE EIGHTHS TO TWENTY NINE AND THREE EIGHTHS
48mc020b L. F. ROTHSCHILD HOLDINGS ROSE ONE AND THREE QUARTERS TO EIGHT AND THREE EIGHTHS
48mc020c THE FIRM'S CO CHIEF EXECUTIVE SAID IT IS MEETING ALL OF ITS CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS
48mc020d SALOMON INCORPORATED ROSE THREE TO TWENTY FIVE E. F. HUTTON GAINED ONE AND SEVEN EIGHTHS TO EIGHTEEN AND FIVE EIGHTHS PAINEWEBBER ADDED ONE TO EIGHTEEN AND A QUARTER
48mc020e <NOISE> THE BILL IF IT BECOMES LAW WOULD BAR HOSTILE ACQUIRERS FROM MERGING WITH THEIR TARGETS FOR THREE YEARS AFTER AN OFFER IS LAUNCHED EXCEPT UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS
48mc020f THE DELAWARE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES UNANIMOUSLY PASSED THE LEGISLATION TUESDAY
48mc020g THE SENATE IS EXPECTED TO APPROVE IT TODAY
48mc020h ONE OF THE BEST KNOWN INTERNATIONAL STOCK PICKERS JOHN TEMPLETON NEARLY EQUALED THE INDEX WITHOUT ANY JAPANESE STOCKS IN HIS SMALL TEMPLETON FOREIGN FUND
48mc020i HE DID SO VIA WINNING BETS IN SUCH MARKETS AS MEXICO CANADA AND BRITAIN
48mc020j WE WERE VERY FORTUNATE HE SAID
48mc020k HIS LARGER FUNDS WHICH CAN INCLUDE U. S. STOCKS DIDN'T FARE AS WELL
48mc020l TURNOUT IS ANOTHER UNKNOWN FACTOR
48mc020m TO CAPITALIZE HERE GOVERNOR DUKAKIS WOULD LIKE TO SEE A HEAVY TURNOUT ESPECIALLY IN SUCH POCKETS OF STRENGTH AS THE CHICAGO LAKEFRONT AND SUBURBS
48mc020n BUT THAT MAY NOT HAPPEN ILLINOIS REGISTRATION IS BELOW NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR AND NO PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE HAS YET CAUGHT FIRE <NOISE>
48mc020o <NOISE> THE NETWORKS HAVE BEGUN THE DELICATE CRAFT OF SPINNING THE NUMBERS TO THEIR BENEFIT AND OF PUTTING THE BEST SHINE ON A DISMAL TELEVISION SEASON
48mc020p <NOISE> C. B. S. HELD A NEWS BRIEFING LAST FRIDAY
48mc020q A. B. C. HOSTS ONE TODAY N. B. C. WILL DO SO TOMORROW
48mc020r SOME RULES GOVERNING THE ABILITY TO STAY IN BUSINESS TAKE EFFECT FRIDAY
48mc020s BUT PROFESSOR PENNINGTON SAYS IT WILL BE TWELVE MONTHS BEFORE BUSINESSES BEGIN TO LOSE THEIR AUTHORIZATION
48mc020t REGULATORS HE SAYS CAN'T BE TOO HARD ON PEOPLE WHO JUSTIFIABLY CLAIM THEY HAVEN'T HAD TIME TO COMPLY
48mc020u <NOISE> ANYONE WHO ACCEPTS THE JOB OF INVESTIGATING THE SPEAKER SHOULD BE PREPARED TO TAKE SOME HEAT
48mc020v LAST WEEK COMMON CAUSE CALLED FOR AN INVESTIGATION OF MR. WRIGHT'S FINANCES
48mc020w THE SPEAKER RETALIATED IN A PUBLIC STATEMENT AND HIS MINIONS IN THE LEADERSHIP SAID THE GROUP WAS DEAD ON CAPITOL HILL
48mc020x THE WHOLE ENVIRONMENT HAS CHANGED HE SAYS
48mc020y WE HAVE A LOT MORE OPTIONS THAN WE DID BEFORE
48mc020z HE'S PLANNING ON SPENDING SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS ON ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION THIS YEAR COMPARED WITH A COUPLE OF MILLION DOLLARS IN THE PAST
48mc0210 CONDOM SALES FOR THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY WERE UP TWENTY SEVEN PERCENT FOR THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDED IN APRIL
48mc0211 CARTER WALLACE'S SHARE AMOUNTS TO OVER FIFTY PERCENT OF THE TOTAL MARKET
48mc0212 MR. CHATICHAI'S WEALTHY FAMILY BACKGROUND AND HIS FAMILY'S LARGE PROPERTY INTERESTS GIVE HIM A GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY
48mc0213 FURTHER HE HAS GOOD RELATIONS WITH THE LARGE ETHNIC CHINESE COMMUNITY AND SERVES AS CHAIRMAN OF THE *THAI* CHINESE FRIENDSHIP ASSOCIATION
48mc0214 THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE COUNTRY'S BUSINESS ELITE MANY OF WHOM ARE ETHNIC CHINESE
48mc0215 AS A RESULT THE SEQUOIA WON'T BE GOING BACK TO THE U. S. NAVY THIS YEAR
48mc0216 OR PERHAPS ANY YEAR
48mc0217 AND THE SHIP WHICH WAS USED BY EIGHT U. S. PRESIDENTS MIGHT EVEN GO UNDER
48mc0218 THE TREASURY IS SCHEDULED TO ANNOUNCE DETAILS OF ITS QUARTERLY FINANCING OPERATION NOVEMBER SECOND
48mc0219 <NOISE> IT USUALLY CONSISTS OF THREE YEAR NOTES TEN YEAR NOTES AND THIRTY YEAR BONDS
48mc021a BUT THE DEPARTMENT IS VERY CLOSE TO REACHING ITS LIMITS ON ISSUING LONG TERM DEBT AND THUS HAS ASKED CONGRESS TO INCREASE ITS AUTHORITY
48mc021b CONGRESS STILL HASN'T COMPLETED WORK ON THE ISSUE WHICH IS PART OF THE TAX BILL PASSED LATE TUESDAY BY THE SENATE
48mc021c IN RECENT MONTHS SPICER HAS CUT ITS ONE THOUSAND MEMBER U. S. STAFF BY TEN PERCENT IN AN EFFORT TO CUT COSTS
48mc021d MR. BERNSTEIN SAID THAT A MERGER OF THE TWO FIRMS WORLD WIDE WOULD CREATE AN INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION WITH ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN ANNUAL REVENUE
48mc021e WE BELIEVE SPICER IS A VERY GOOD NICHE FIRM BUT OUR MERGER DISCUSSIONS ARE VERY EARLY AT THIS POINT HE SAID
48mc0301 <NOISE> IN ADDITION TO THE WAR OF NERVES OVER DISCOUNTS RETAIL EXECUTIVES SAID THIS CHRISTMAS SEASON HAS BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY THE ABSENCE OF A BIG HIT IN THE TOY DEPARTMENT
48mc0302 BUT RETAILERS HAVE SEEN STRONG SALES OF BIG TICKET ITEMS TO WELL HEELED CUSTOMERS
48mc0303 THEY ARE BUYING TO BEAT THE NEW TAX LAW WHICH WILL END THE DEDUCTION OF SALES TAXES AND SOME INTEREST EXPENSES
48mc0304 IT'S ABOUT AS INTERESTING AS YESTERDAY'S TUNA FISH SAID MARYANN KELLER AN AUTO ANALYST WITH FURMAN SELZ MAGER DIETZ AND BIRNEY
48mc0305 THE JAPANESE ARE GOING TO HAVE A HECK OF A TIME SELLING TWO POINT THREE MILLION CARS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
48mc0306 I'M NOT SURE HOLDING QUOTAS DOES THEM ANY HARM
48mc0307 MS. BASS WON'T DISCUSS STRATEGY FOR I. MAGNIN
48mc0308 BUT INDUSTRY OBSERVERS SAY I. MAGNIN LIKE OTHER RETAILERS IN TODAY'S SATURATED MARKETS WILL HAVE TO ESTABLISH A MORE FOCUSED IDENTITY
48mc0309 MS. BASS ALSO WILL HAVE TO REASSESS THE VALUE OF SOME OF ITS SCATTERED STORES INCLUDING THOSE IN CHICAGO WASHINGTON AND ARIZONA AND INCREASE SALES VOLUME
48mc030a THAT'S THE ONLY CURE SAYS MARK SHULMAN PRESIDENT OF LIMITED INCORPORATED'S HENRI BENDEL AND A FORMER EXECUTIVE AT I. MAGNIN AND BLOOMINGDALE'S
48mc030b WHILE ALL WEST GERMAN POLITICAL PARTIES AGREED ON THE NEED FOR TAX CUTS OF ABOUT TWENTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS THEY DIFFER ON WHO SHOULD BENEFIT
48mc030c THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATS AND THE LEFT WING GREENS WANT THE CUTS TO HELP THE POOR AND THE WORKING CLASS
48mc030d WITHIN THE RULING COALITION THE LIBERAL FREE DEMOCRATS AND THE BAVARIAN SISTER PARTY OF THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS THE CHRISTIAN SOCIALISTS WANT CUTS SPREAD ACROSS THE BOARD
48mc030e HIS ANSWER RAISE THE TEMPERATURE ARTIFICIALLY IN THE MORNING BY JOGGING OR WITH A HOT DRINK
48mc030f BREAKFAST ALSO HELPS AS DOES JUMPING INTO A HOT SHOWER ON AWAKENING
48mc030g AT THE OPPOSITE END MORNING PEOPLE TAKE NAPS
48mc030h A FIFTEEN TO TWENTY MINUTE NAP AT TWO OR THREE P. M. <NOISE> WILL GIVE THEM MORE ENERGY
48mc030i MR. WALSH'S LEGAL THEORY ABOUT THE FLOW OF FUNDS IS LIKELY TO BE THE LINCHPIN OF AN EFFORT TO BRING BROADER CONSPIRACY AND OTHER CRIMINAL CHARGES
48mc030j CENTRAL TARGETS OF THE INVESTIGATION INCLUDE FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JOHN POINDEXTER FORMER WHITE HOUSE AIDE OLIVER NORTH AND RETIRED AIR FORCE MAJOR GENERAL RICHARD SECORD
48mc030k A FINAL DECISION ON SEEKING CHARGES COULD COME IN SEPTEMBER
48mc030l IN THE TWO SELECTED AREAS THE STATE WILL ALLOW PROCUREMENT AND RETAIL PRICES TO RISE TO WHAT THE OPEN MARKET DEMANDS
48mc030m THE SUBSIDY FOR CONSUMERS IS MEANT TO REDUCE THE STRAIN ON URBAN RESIDENTS
48mc030n FARMERS OF COURSE WILL GET HIGHER PRICES FOR THEIR GRAIN FROM THE MARKET WHICH IN TURN SHOULD INDUCE THEM TO INCREASE PRODUCTION
48mc030o GRAIN PRODUCTION THROUGHOUT CHINA HAS FALTERED IN RECENT YEARS IN PART BECAUSE STATE PROCUREMENT PRICES WERE TOO LOW
48mc030p REMEMBER THE ONE ABOUT THE INVESTMENT BANKER
48mc030q IT WAS WIDELY TOLD CIRCA OCTOBER NINETEENTH *NINETEEN* EIGHTY SEVEN AND WENT LIKE THIS WHAT DO YOU CALL AN INVESTMENT BANKER
48mc030r HEY WAITER
48mc030s HARDLINERS FOR INSTANCE WANT A LAW THAT BANS ALL OBSCENE AND INDECENT SPEECH OVER THE TELEPHONE

48mc030u DIAL A PORN HE SAYS MOVES SEXUALITY FROM THE HUMAN LEVEL TO THE ANIMAL LEVEL
48mc030v THESE ARE VERY INTERESTING TIMES SAID RICHARD SHAFFER AN INDUSTRY CONSULTANT AND ANALYST WHO PUBLISHES TECHNOLOGIC COMPUTER LETTER
48mc030w A YEAR AGO IT SEEMED THAT I. B. M. AND MICROSOFT ALONE WOULD DICTATE THE STANDARDS FOR DESKTOP COMPUTERS IN THE OFFICE
48mc030x NOW AFTER APPLE'S LAWSUIT CHALLENGING MICROSOFT AND SUN COMING UP WITH OPEN LOOK FOR UNIX WE HAVE THE POSSIBILITY OF SEEING THREE VERY COMPETITIVE STANDARDS
48mc030y THE GOVERNMENT'S OFFICIAL ARMED FORCES MAGAZINES TRADITIONALLY HAVE BEEN OFF LIMITS TO ALL ADVERTISERS
48mc030z BUT RECENTLY THE ARMY AND NAVY STARTED CONSIDERING FARMING THEIRS OUT TO COMMERCIAL PUBLISHERS WHO WOULD ACCEPT ADS
48mc0310 <NOISE> WE'RE EXPLORING IT TO SEE HOW MUCH MONEY WE COULD SAVE ON OUR SOLDIERS MAGAZINE AN ARMY SPOKESMAN SAYS
48mc0311 ALL OF THIS REFLECTS A MOVE OF TRANSITION AND UNCERTAINTY THAT HAS GRIPPED BRITAIN'S PUBLICLY SUBSIDIZED THEATER IN RECENT YEARS
48mc0312 FRETTING ABOUT FINANCES MOST COMPANIES ARE TAKING FEWER CREATIVE RISKS
48mc0313 AUDIENCES IN TURN HAVE GROWN MORE CONSERVATIVE
48mc0314 YET THERE'S MORE WORK PERFORMED NOW THAN IN YEARS MAINLY TO KEEP REVENUES FLOWING

48qc020z BUT IF IT SUCCEEDS COMPANIES THAT HAVEN'T DISMANTLED OR SCALED BACK THEIR RESEARCH EFFORTS COULD SUDDENLY BE AHEAD OF THE COMPETITION
48qc0210 BUT EXXON CORPORATION AMOCO CORPORATION AND ATLANTIC RICHFIELD COMPANY POSTED HIGHER PROFIT
48qc0211 NEW YORK BASED EXXON THE NATION'S BIGGEST OIL COMPANY HAD THE SMALLEST PERCENTAGE INCREASE
48qc0212 ITS NET INCOME CLIMBED FIVE POINT ONE PERCENT EVEN THOUGH GAINS FROM ASSET SALES CONTRIBUTED THIRTY FOUR CENTS A SHARE TO YEAR EARLIER PROFIT

48qc0219 THE SENATE PLAN WOULD PROVIDE THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE NATIONAL GUARD TO HELP THE CUSTOMS SERVICE WITH DRUG INSPECTIONS AT U. S. BORDERS
48qc021a BUT ADDITIONAL USE OF MILITARY RADAR PLANES EXPANDED NAVAL PATROLS AND MORE FREQUENT AIRCRAFT INTERCEPTIONS COULD DRAIN THE MILITARY'S ALREADY TIGHT OPERATING BUDGETS
48qc021b THE MEASURE DOESN'T PROVIDE ANY SPECIAL FUNDS FOR THESE OPERATIONS
48qc021c STEPHEN A. DUZAN CHAIRMAN PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER SAID IT'S OBVIOUSLY QUITE A CHANGE FROM A YEAR AGO
48qc021d IT'S OUR THIRD YEAR OF CASH FLOW AND WE'VE BEEN PROFITABLE FOR THREE OUT OF THE LAST FOUR QUARTERS
48qc021e SO WE THINK IN GENERAL THAT THIS REPRESENTS A REAL HEALTHY KIND OF PICTURE FOR A COMPANY WHOSE PRODUCTS AREN'T YET APPROVED
48qc021f THE COMPANY CURRENTLY HAS FOUR OF ITS EXPERIMENTAL PRODUCTS IN HUMAN CLINICAL TRIALS FOR DISEASES SUCH AS CANCER AND ACQUIRED IMMUNE DEFICIENCY SYNDROME
48qc0301 AS EXPECTED THE BUDGET WILL INCLUDE A NUMBER OF PROPOSALS THAT WERE UNSUCCESSFUL LAST YEAR INCLUDING THE SALE OF THE NAVAL PETROLEUM RESERVE AND THE BONNEVILLE POWER ADMINISTRATION
48qc0302 SOME ADMINISTRATION AND CONGRESSIONAL AIDES THINK CONGRESS WILL GO ALONG WITH SELLING THE PETROLEUM RESERVE THIS YEAR
48qc0303 BUT RESISTANCE TO THE BONNEVILLE IDEA WAS SO STRONG THAT LAWMAKERS PASSED A RESOLUTION PROHIBITING THE ADMINISTRATION FROM SPENDING ANY FEDERAL MONEY TO STUDY IT

48qc0307 THE POLITICAL REASONS FOR CHAIRMAN KENNEDY'S SINGLE MINDEDNESS ARE CLEAR ENOUGH
48qc0308 ORGANIZED LABOR A MAJOR DEMOCRATIC CONSTITUENCY HAS FALLEN ON HARD TIMES AS REFLECTED IN A DECLINE IN THE UNIONIZED SHARE OF THE U. S. WORK FORCE

48qc030o FIRST INTERSTATE'S FOURTH QUARTER LOSS RESULTED FROM A PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLION DOLLAR ADDITION TO ITS RESERVES AGAINST POSSIBLE FOREIGN DEBT LOSSES
48qc030p BUT EVEN WITHOUT THE RESERVES THE COMPANY SAID EARNINGS WOULD HAVE BEEN FLAT AT ABOUT EIGHTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS COMPARED WITH THE YEAR EARLIER QUARTER
48qc030q FIRST INTERSTATE HAD A SLIGHT DECLINE IN EARNINGS ASSETS AND NEGLIGIBLE GROWTH IN NET INTEREST INCOME

48qc030y MANY SCHOOLS ARE ENCOURAGING HOLDOUTS RESULTING IN WHAT SOME EDUCATORS CALL THE GRAYING OF KINDERGARTEN
48qc030z MR. AGEE SAID THE LOSSES WERE A DISAPPOINTMENT AND A SURPRISE TO THE BOARD TOO
48qc0310 THAT SUGGESTS THAT MR. AGEE MIGHT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT IN TO SHAKE THINGS UP
48qc0311 IN A TELEPHONE INTERVIEW FRIDAY MR. AGEE DIDN'T RULE ANYTHING OUT
48qc0312 THE GANGS ARE EVEN BECOMING ADEPT AT THEIR OWN SORT OF PUBLIC RELATIONS

48qc0316 NOW IT IS CONCENTRATING ON PROFESSIONALISM AND THE SERVICING OF EXISTING STORES HE SAYS
48qc0317 NEW STORES WILL BE LARGER OUTLETS CALLED UNITED COLORS THAT WILL OFFER A MUCH BROADER RANGE OF MERCHANDISE
48qc0318 BENETTON PLANS TO HAVE TEN UNITED COLORS SHOPS OPERATING IN THE U. S. BY NEXT SPRING

48qc040a A LIMITED STRIKE TARGETED AT KEY PLANTS A STRATEGY THE U. A. W. USED FOR A WEEK AGAINST G. M. IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR WOULD BUFFER THE IMPACT
48qc040b A STRIKE AGAINST A SECOND COMPANY IN CANADA WHERE THE CANADIAN AUTO WORKERS UNION IS BARGAINING INDEPENDENTLY THIS YEAR FOR THE FIRST TIME COULD BROADEN THE DAMAGE

48qc040d <NOISE> CHRYSLER CORPORATION IS NEGOTIATING IN CANADA THIS YEAR ALTHOUGH ITS U. S. CONTRACT DOESN'T EXPIRE UNTIL NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT

48qc040v UNACCEPTABLY AWFUL

48rc021d THE GLOBAL AIRLINE PREMIUMS HAVE DROPPED TO ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FROM ABOUT ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
48rc021e MEANWHILE AIRLINE LOSSES IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT ROSE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE PREVIOUS YEAR

48rc030a WE ARE EVALUATING THE OFFERS FOR THE COMPANY AND FOR THE SHAREHOLDERS BUT WE PROFOUNDLY REGRET THE SITUATION
48rc030b THIS IS THE FIRST TEST FOR MR. RUDER'S ABILITY TO ADJUDICATE BETWEEN THE AGENCY'S PROSECUTORS AND ECONOMISTS WHICH CAN BE A FULL TIME JOB
48rc030c AS USUAL IN THE RECENT PAST THE ECONOMISTS HAVE THE BETTER ARGUMENT HERE
48rc030d THERE IS NO GOOD REASON TO OUTLAW THE OPEN MARKET PURCHASES OF SHARES IN ANY CASE AND ESPECIALLY NOT WHERE NONPROFESSIONAL SHAREHOLDERS ARE THE BIG WINNERS
48rc030e THE AUCTION HOUSE SAID THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT THE TOP TEN ART WORKS ALL SOLD FOR MORE THAN ONE MILLION DOLLARS EACH
48rc030f RECORDS WERE SET FOR SIX ARTISTS INCLUDING MARC CHAGALL CLAUDE MONET AND PIERRE AUGUSTE RENOIR

48rc030l I FIGURE IT WAS WORTH SIXTY FIVE DOLLARS AND EIGHTY FIVE CENTS A SHARE ON THURSDAY
48rc030m WITH FRIDAY'S REVISION IT'S WORTH SIXTY EIGHT DOLLARS A SHARE
48rc030n THE REVISED TERMS ARE NO LESS ATTRACTIVE THAN THE ORIGINAL TERMS IN THE POST CRASH MARKET
48rc030o NEVERTHELESS FIRST OPTIONS STILL LETS CUSTOMERS SUCH AS JAMES F. HART TRADE IN NAKED OUT OF THE MONEY PUTS AND CALLS

48rc030u SINCE THEN THE COMPOSITE HAS FALLEN WITH LITTLE INTERRUPTION
48rc030v COMPUTERVISION THE PIONEER IN THE COMPUTERIZED DESIGN MARKET HAS HAD POOR FINANCIAL RESULTS IN RECENT YEARS AS IT REVAMPED ITS AGED PROJECT LINE

48rc030x ALTHOUGH IT HAS SLIPPED FROM FIRST TO THIRD IN SIZE IN THE INDUSTRY IT RETAINS A SUBSTANTIAL BASE OF CUSTOMERS
48rc030y NINETEEN NINETY NINE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN WRITTEN BY A SERVING PRESIDENT
48rc030z IT IS ALL A PRESIDENT CAN DO TO KEEP UP WITH EVENTS TIME FOR REFLECTION IS A LUXURY BEYOND REACH
48rc0310 NOR IS THERE TIME FOR A PRESIDENT TO LEARN MUCH BEYOND THE KNOWLEDGE <NOISE> WITH WHICH HE COMES TO OFFICE
48rc0311 THAT'S WORTH REMEMBERING WHEN WE THINK NOT ABOUT NINETEEN NINETY NINE BUT ABOUT NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT

48rc0316 BUT THE COST OF MANUFACTURING THE NA:TURAL PLASTIC IS PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE FIFTEEN DOLLARS A POUND COMPARED WITH ROUGHLY SIXTY FIVE CENTS A POUND FOR CONVENTIONAL PLASTIC
48rc0317 HOWEVER THE COMPANY SAYS IT HOPES TO REDUCE MANUFACTURING COSTS ENOUGH TO BEGIN MARKETING THE PLASTIC IN TWO TO FIVE YEARS

48rc031c THESE MIXED FEELINGS OF FRUSTRATION WITH AND GRATITUDE TOWARD THE AUTHORITIES ARE PART OF THE EVERYDAY LIFE OF A FOREIGNER DOING BUSINESS IN KOREA

48rc0401 THE TRASH
48rc0402 PROOFS OF PURCHASE AND SALES RECEIPTS THAT HAD BEEN TURNED IN FOR CONSUMER PRODUCT REBATES AND ALREADY PAID
48rc0403 THE WOMEN RESUBMITTED THOUSANDS OF THE REBATES AND CAMOUFLAGED THEIR TRAIL BY VARYING THEIR NAMES AND USING POSTAL BOXES ALL OVER THE COUNTRY
48rc0404 UNLIKE MORE ECLECTIC RAIDERS MR. TRUMP HAS SO FAR STUCK TO REAL ESTATE

48rc0407 HUMANA TRIED TO DEFEND ITSELF THROUGH DIVERSIFICATION AS DID THE OTHER LARGE CHAINS HOSPITAL CORPORATION OF AMERICA AMERICAN MEDICAL INTERNATIONAL INCORPORATED AND NATIONAL MEDICAL ENTERPRISES INCORPORATED
48rc0408 THE IDEA WAS THAT IF A HOSPITAL OWNER ALSO HAD AN INSURANCE PLAN IT COULD STEER PATIENTS TO ITS INSTITUTIONS THROUGH FINANCIAL INCENTIVES
48rc0409 THE PATIENT POOL MIGHT SHRINK BUT THE COMPANY COULD GRAB A BIGGER PART OF IT
48rc040a LAST MONTH AUTO SALES FELL ONE POINT FOUR PERCENT AFTER RISING FIVE POINT SEVEN PERCENT IN AUGUST

48rc040z THE DECLINE IN CRUDE PRICES EVENTUALLY WILL END HOWEVER
48rc0410 OR PRODUCT PRICES COULD AGAIN BECOME LINKED TO THOSE FOR CRUDE
48rc0411 AND GASOLINE DEMAND USUALLY DROPS AFTER LABOR DAY
48rc0412 BUT MR. RANDOL SUGGESTS THAT A TREND TOWARD PERMANENTLY IMPROVED REFINER MARGINS IS SUSTAINABLE
48rc0413 THROUGH ITS U. S. FINANCE SUBSIDIARY TOYOTA HAS ISSUED COMMERCIAL PAPER IN THE U. S. AND PRIVATELY PLACED MEDIUM TERM NOTES
48rc0414 IT HAS ALSO RAISED MORE THAN TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN THE EUROMARKETS BUT SO FAR HAS AVOIDED ISSUING STRAIGHT DEBT IN THE PUBLIC U. S. MARKET

48sc020b A. Z. T. IS MARKETED UNDER THE NAME RETROVIR BY BURROUGHS WELLCOME COMPANY AT AN ANNUAL RETAIL DOSAGE COST OF ABOUT TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS
48sc020c IT ALSO IS THE MOST EXPENSIVE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PROMPTING FEARS THAT SOME INSURERS WHO NORMALLY PROVIDE PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE WILL BALK AT ITS PRICE
48sc020d MR. BOTHA W- ALSO MUST RULE ON THE FATE OF THE GROUP AREAS ACT
48sc020e VIOLATIONS OF THE ACT ARE RAMPANT BUT THERE WERE ONLY FOUR PROSECUTIONS UNDER IT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX ONE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE AND NONE THE YEAR BEFORE

48sc020h ON THE BIG BOARD VOLUME ROSE TO TWO HUNDRED TWENTY POINT FIVE MILLION SHARES FROM ONE HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT POINT SIX MILLION THURSDAY
48sc020i BUT THE ACTIVITY WAS LESS THAN ON THE PREVIOUS TRIPLE WITCHING DAYS AND MUCH OF THE TRADING WAS PACKED INTO THE OPENING AND CLOSING MINUTES OF THE SESSION

48sc020p THE FRENCH WERE SO IMPRESSED BY THE CELEBRATION THEY THANKED THE U. S. IN AN AD IN A NEW YORK NEWSPAPER
48sc020q IN THE END THERE IS LITTLE THE U. S. CAN DO TO CONTROL EVENTS IN SOUTH AFRICA
48sc020r THE ADMINISTRATION'S SIX YEAR CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT POLICY DESIGNED TO COAX PRETORIA TOWARD DISMANTLING APARTHEID DIDN'T SUCCEED
48sc020s AND SANCTIONS IN THE SHORT RUN WON'T DAMAGE SOUTH AFRICA'S SELF RELIANT ECONOMY

48sc030a DEFENDERS OF THE FOOTNOTE ARGUE THAT IT MAKES SENSE AS TAX POLICY
48sc030b WHY THEY ASK SHOULD WEALTHY BEST SELLING AUTHORS GET SUBSTANTIAL TAX DEFERRALS WHILE MOM AND POP MANUFACTURERS FOR EXAMPLE CAN'T
48sc030c AS A RULE OF TAXES IT'S A GOOD RULE BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT PEOPLE TAKING DEDUCTIONS BEFORE THEY GET THE INCOME SAYS ONE CONGRESSIONAL AIDE

48sc030e MR. AMMAN FORTY NINE YEARS OLD SAID HE BELIEVES WESTERN UNION'S DEBT AND EQUITY HOLDERS WILL SUPPORT THE RESTRUCTURING
48sc030f HE ADDED THAT THE RESTRUCTURING MUST BE COMPLETED IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS BECAUSE THE COMPANY IS RUNNING SHORT OF CASH
48sc030g WESTERN UNION HAS SAID THAT IF ITS PLANS ARE DEFEATED IT WILL FILE FOR REORGANIZATION UNDER CHAPTER ELEVEN OF THE FEDERAL BANKRUPTCY LAWS
48sc030h THE CONFRONTATION IN FEDERAL COURT MAY BREAK NEW GROUND IN BANKRUPTCY LAW

48tc0210 SWITZERLAND HAS ALREADY ATTRACTED ONE MILLION RESIDENT ALIENS A PORTION OF ITS POPULATION GREATER THAN ANY E. C. STATE EXCEPT LUXEMBOURG
48tc0211 MOST SWISS THINK THAT THAT IS ENOUGH AND THE COUNTRY HAS IMPOSED FOREIGN WORKER QUOTAS SO STRICT THAT THE SKILLED LABOR IS IN SHORT SUPPLY
48tc0212 YET IF SWITZERLAND CLOSES ITS DOOR TO MORE E. C. NATIONALS SWISS WHO WORK IN THE E. C. MAY FIND THEMSELVES LESS WELCOME
48tc0213 HE IS STRIKING NOW AT A TIME WHEN FINANCING FOR BIG DEALS IS READILY AVAILABLE AND THE STOCK PRICE IS DOWN

48tc0306 BUT THEY ARE CONSIDERED BETTER THAN A MERE PROMISE TO THE EXECUTIVE
48tc0307 THE DIET IS A ONE HOUSE LEGISLATURE APPOINTED BY DISTRICT RATHER THAN POPULATION LIKE THE SENATE AS OPPOSED TO THE HOUSE
48tc0308 THIS MEANS THAT JAPANESE FARMERS HAVE TREMENDOUS CONTROL OVER JAPANESE POLITICS
48tc0309 FOOD PRICES IN JAPAN TAKE FORTY PERCENT OR MORE OF THE AVERAGE PERSON'S WAGE
48tc030a WITH HOUSING TAKING ANOTHER FORTY PERCENT AND THE FACT THAT THE JAPANESE ARE GREAT SAVERS THEY ARE LEFT WITH ALMOST NO DISCRETIONARY INCOME
48tc030b THIS IS WHY THEY CANNOT DEVELOP A DOMESTIC MARKET
48tc030c THEY DON'T HAVE MONEY TO SPEND EXCEPT A SMALL AMOUNT OF SAVINGS THAT THEY SPEND ONLY ON SPECIAL OCCASIONS OR FOR UNUSUAL BARGAINS
48tc030d CONSEQUENTLY LLOYD'S AND SOME BROKERS MAY BE FORCED TO INCREASE THEIR SHARE OF THE SETTLEMENT PAYMENT

48tc0313 STILL MS. FREEDMAN NOTED THAT A BRIGHT FORECAST FOR HIRING ISN'T NECESSARILY ALL GOOD NEWS
48tc0314 THE INCREASING USE OF LABOR MAY BE BECAUSE OF A TREMENDOUS BOOM IN THE OUTPUT OF GOODS AND SERVICES SHE SAID
48tc0315 BUT IT ALSO MIGHT BE BECAUSE YOU AREN'T IMPROVING THE EFFICIENCY WITH WHICH YOU USE THE LABOR FORCE THE PRODUCTIVITY
48tc0316 RICHARD ROSLUND A VICE PRESIDENT OF BLOCK TRADING AT KIDDER PEABODY SAID THE FED'S CHAIRMAN'S REMARKS GAVE THE MARKET A REASON TO ADOPT A MORE POSITIVE OUTLOOK
48tc0317 PEOPLE ARE JUST LOOKING FOR ANYTHING TO GRASP ON HE SAID
48tc0318 IT'S BEEN SUCH A PESSIMISTIC ATMOSPHERE IN THE PAST COUPLE OF WEEKS
48tc0319 ANALYSTS SAY THEY EXPECT P. AND G'S MOMENTUM TO CARRY INTO NINETEEN NINETY AND BEYOND AND MANY RAISED THEIR FISCAL NINETEEN NINETY ESTIMATES

48uc021a ONCE YOU GET THAT THEME THE LEVEL OF P. E. RATIO DOESN'T MEAN A DAMN SAYS MR. ROBINS
48uc021b IT'S ALL A BIT OF MIRAGE
48uc021c YET ONE THAT SO FAR HAS WORKED
48uc021d NINE MONTH RESULTS ALSO INCLUDE A TWELVE MILLION DOLLAR NET LOSS FROM THE DISPOSITION OF TRUCKING OPERATIONS
48uc021e ABOUT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS OF THE TRUCKING CHARGE WAS TAKEN IN THE THIRD QUARTER
48uc021f YEAR EARLIER RESULTS WERE RESTATED FOR ACCOUNTING CHANGES
48uc0301 WHEN MS. HIGA TOOK OVER THE BUSINESS IN NINETEEN SIXTY SIX FROZEN PIZZA WAS STILL A LONG SHOT
48uc0302 THE AVERAGE JAPANESE DIDN'T HAVE FREEZER SPACE LET ALONE AN OVEN
48uc0303 AND THE MOST COMMON RESPONSE TO SUPERMARKET TASTE TESTS WAS THAT CHEESE LOOKED AND TASTED LIKE SOAP SHE RECALLS
48uc0304 BUT SHE KEPT GOING PEDDLING HER PIZZAS TO RESTAURANTS AND FANCY HOTELS
48uc0305 <NOISE> SMOKERS ARE FEELING THE HEAT BECAUSE COMPANIES ARE TAKING A HARDER LINE ON SUCH ISSUES AS PRODUCTIVITY RISING MEDICAL COSTS AND THE EFFECTS OF PASSIVE SMOKE
48uc0306 ALTHOUGH THERE ARE CONFLICTING CLAIMS ABOUT WHETHER SMOKERS COST EMPLOYERS MORE IN TERMS OF HIGHER INSURANCE RATES AND ABSENTEEISM COMPANIES OFTEN CITE SUCH CONCERNS TO JUSTIFY RESTRICTIVE SMOKING POLICIES
48uc0307 <NOISE> IN ADDITION NEW STATE AND LOCAL ORDINANCES AND EMPLOYEE COMPLAINTS PUT SIGNIFICANT PRESSURE ON MANY COMPANIES
48uc0308 THE GOVERNMENT CIVIL SUIT ALLEGED THAT A DEFECT COULD CAUSE THE REAR BRAKES TO LOCK SENDING THE CAR SPINNING OUT OF CONTROL
48uc0309 G. M. WHICH NO LONGER MAKES X. CARS DENIED THAT THE BRAKES ARE DEFECTIVE
48uc030a AGREEING WITH G. M. JUDGE JACKSON RULED THAT THE GOVERNMENT CAME TO COURT WITH NOTHING MORE ESSENTIALLY THAN A REASONABLE SUSPICION THAT A DEFECT EXISTED
48uc030b THE SUIT WHICH ALSO NAMES THE COMPANY'S DIRECTORS AS DEFENDANTS SAYS THE DIRECTORS HAVE GIVEN PERSONAL GAIN A PRIORITY OVER THE INTERESTS OF PUBLIC SHAREHOLDERS
48uc030c A SECOND SUIT BY MOSHE J. SCHWARTZ JEFFREY ABRAMS STANLEY HEINEMAN AND JAMES T. CAIN CONTAINS COMPARABLE CHARGES
48uc030d EARLIER AT LEAST TWO OF THOSE SAME PLAINTIFFS FILED A SUIT OVER THE ANTAR STOCK SALES
48uc030e A LOSS WASN'T UNEXPECTED GIVEN CONTINENTAL'S OPERATIONAL DIFFICULTIES THAT DEVELOPED IN THE QUARTER
48uc030f HOWEVER THE RESULTS OF TEXAS AIR'S SUBSIDIARIES ARE THE REVERSE OF WHAT MANY ANALYSTS HAD PREDICTED EARLIER THIS YEAR
48uc030g INSTEAD OF A MODEST PROFIT AT LOW COST CONTINENTAL BY THE SECOND QUARTER THE NEWLY EXPANDED UNIT HAS STRUGGLED WITH LOSSES
48uc030h ITS HIGHER COST SISTER EASTERN AIRLINES HAS SHOWN SIGNS OF FINANCIAL PROGRESS DESPITE CONTINUING CONFRONTATIONS WITH ITS EMPLOYEE UNIONS
48uc030i MR. LAY SAID THE LOSSES OCCURED IN LATE SEPTEMBER AND EARLY THIS MONTH A TIME OF PARTICULAR VOLATILITY IN OIL MARKETS
48uc030j THERE WERE TWO SENIOR PEOPLE COLLUDING AND KEEPING A SEPARATE SET OF BOOKS APART FROM THE OFFICIAL BOOKS FOR A FEW WEEKS MR. LAY SAID
48uc030k THEIR GUESSES WERE WRONG ON BOTH SIDES OF THE MARKET
48uc030l AN F. T. C. SPOKESMAN DECLINED TO COMMENT
48uc030m THE INVESTIGATION WAS FIRST REPORTED IN F. T. C. WATCH A PUBLICATION ABOUT REGULATORY MATTERS
48uc030n REACHED IN NEW YORK LAST NIGHT MR. TRUMP CONFIRMED THAT THE F. T. C. HAD MADE THE REQUEST
48uc030o HE DECLINED TO ELABORATE
48uc030p SEPARATELY WALL STREET SPECULATION GREW THAT MEDIA INVESTOR RUPERT MURDOCH WAS CONSIDERING ACQUIRING A STAKE IN LONDON BASED W. P. P.
48uc030q A MURDOCH AIDE SAID THAT MR. MURDOCH HAS BEEN LOOKING FOR A LONG TIME AT THE COMPANY
48uc030r BUT A W. P. P. SPOKESMAN SAID THAT THERE HAS BEEN NO CONTACT AND THERE HAS BEEN NO ACQUISITION OF W. P. P. SHARES BY MURDOCH
48uc030s YESTERDAY PEOPLE CLOSE TO FEDERATED'S BOARD SAID THAT THE COMPANY WAS STILL OPEN TO YET ANOTHER FRIENDLY MERGER PROPOSAL FROM CAMPEAU
48uc030t IF THEY'VE GOT SOMETHING TO SHOW US WE'LL TAKE A LOOK AT IT
48uc030u THEY KNOW WHERE TO FIND US SAID ONE SOURCE
48uc030v WE'RE NOT STONEWALLING THEM
48uc030w <NOISE> I CAN'T GUARANTEE OUR GROUP IS ONE HUNDRED PERCENT SOLID SAID AN OFFICIAL AT SUEZ A FRENCH HOLDING COMPANY
48uc030x <NOISE> I CAN'T TELL YOU THAT AT THOSE PRICES THERE WON'T BE ANY RENEGING ON AGREEMENTS SIGNED BY THE CONSORTIUM'S MEMBERS
48uc030y BUT HE ADDED SUCH ACTION COULD LEAD TO LEGAL REPRISALS
48uc030z BOTH SIDES HAVE WORKED HARD AND SOME PROGRESS HAS BEEN REALIZED IN A NUMBER OF AREAS SAID MESSRS.
48uc0310 SHULTZ AND SHEVARDNADZE IN A JOINT STATEMENT LAST NIGHT
48uc0311 BUT MUCH MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE
48uc0312 THE UNITED NATIONS WHOSE GARBAGE BILL IS FORTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH IS SERVED BY NATIONAL CARTING COMPANY WHICH WON THE PICKUP RIGHTS EIGHT YEARS AGO
48uc0313 LAST DECEMBER THE U. N. DIDN'T ATTEMPT TO SOLICIT BIDS
48uc0314 IT SIMPLY EXTENDED ITS CONTRACT WITH NATIONAL CARTING
48uc0315 SOLICITING BIDS IN THIS PARTICULAR INDUSTRY IS NOT THE WAY TO GO A U. N. SPOKESMAN SAYS IMPLYING THAT IT IS FUTILE
48uc0316 BUT CRITICS CHARGED THAT THE COLLAR ACTUALLY ADDED TO THE VOLATILITY BY MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR INDEX ARBITRAGERS TO DO THEIR BUSINESS
48uc0317 MANY TRADERS ARGUE THAT SUCH ARBITRAGE HAS THE EFFECT OF SMOOTHING OUT VOLATILITY IN THE MARKETS
48uc0318 INDEX ARBITRAGERS BUY AND SELL LARGE AMOUNTS OF STOCKS AND STOCK INDEX FUTURES TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF BRIEF PRICE DISPARITIES BETWEEN THE TWO RELATED INSTRUMENTS
48uc0319 THE SCENE THE ANNUAL NORMAN MAILER COCKTAIL PARTY AND FIST FIGHT
48uc031a CANDICE BERGEN AND WOODY ALLEN HAD JUST JOINED A GROUP OF PSEUDO INTELLECTUALS AND WERE RAMBLING WITH THE BEST OF THEM
48uc031b I OFTEN THINK OBSERVED MS. BERGEN THAT IF DOSTOEVSKI HAD BEEN A SINGER HE'D HAVE SOUNDED LIKE RAY CHARLES
48uc031c THE OTHER NON WINNERS MOST NOTABLY EXXON WERE IN MANY WAYS AS NOTEWORTHY AS THE WINNERS
48uc031d IT IS BELIEVED THAT EXXON WAS OUTBID FOR SEVERAL RESERVE PACKAGES LEAVING IT WITH A LOT OF CASH THAT COULD STILL BE EARMARKED FOR ACQUISITIONS
48uc031e AT THE HOUSTON PETROLEUM CLUB INDUSTRY OFFICIALS COULDN'T EAT LUNCH OF LATE WITHOUT DISCUSSING SPECULATION THAT EXXON WAS GOING TO WALK AWAY WITH ALL OF THE TENNECO PROPERTIES
48uc031f AN EXXON SPOKESWOMAN SAID IT WAS COMPANY POLICY NOT TO COMMENT ON ANYTHING TO DO WITH ACQUISITIONS
48uc0401 ALSO SELLING WELL WAS A FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR ISSUE OF REVENUE BONDS BY THE FLORIDA DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES
48uc0402 THE UNSOLD BALANCE WAS ABOUT TEN POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS
48uc0403 <NOISE> THE BONDS WERE PRICED AFTER AUCTION TO YIELD FROM FOUR POINT TWO ZERO PERCENT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT TO SEVEN POINT TWO ZERO PERCENT IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE
48uc0404 <NOISE> MOODY'S RATED THE BONDS SINGLE A. WHILE S. AND P. RATED THEM SINGLE A. MINUS
48uc0405 GOLDMAN SACHS AND COMPANY WAS THE LEAD UNDERWRITER
48uc0406 STILL HE WOULD HAVE PREFERRED THERE TO BE NO BIDS AT ALL
48uc0407 THE COMPANY'S POLICY FOR EIGHTY FIVE YEARS HAS BEEN TO BE INDEPENDENT AND GROW AND WE HAVE SUCCEEDED HE SAYS
48uc0408 WE ARE EVALUATING THE OFFERS FOR THE COMPANY AND FOR THE SHAREHOLDERS BUT WE PROFOUNDLY REGRET THE SITUATION
48uc0409 SO STRANGE IS THE SITUATION THAT ONE HOLLY DIRECTOR HAS PROPOSED CHANGING THE COMPANY'S NAME TO FANTASY S- SUGAR COMPANY
48uc040a HE SAYS HE COULD ENTICE SHAMROCK BECAUSE OF ITS DISNEY CONNECTION TO BUY THE COMPANY
48uc040b JUST THINK OF HOW MUCH THEY COULD MAKE ON THE MOVIE RIGHTS HE ADDS
48uc040c DURING THE PAST SEVERAL DAYS CORPORATIONS AND OTHER BIG INVESTORS HAVE REFRAINED FROM LENDING TREASURY BONDS AND NOTES TO SECURITIES DEALERS FOR BRIEF PERIODS
48uc040d THAT IN TURN HAS FORCED MANY DEALERS TO REFRAIN FROM SELLING BORROWED SECURITIES OR AMASSING SO CALLED SHORT POSITIONS
48uc040e IT'S HARD TO SHORT ANYTHING IN THIS MARKET AT THE MOMENT SAID A TRADER AT A LARGE GOVERNMENT SECURITIES DEALER
48uc040f MR. ANTONIU DENIES ANY WRONGDOING
48uc040g I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO WORRY ABOUT THE FORMER INVESTMENT BANKER SAYS
48uc040h I HAVE ALWAYS FOLLOWED THE ADVICE OF MY LAWYER AND ACCOUNTANTS
48uc040i HE SAYS THAT HE HAS COOPERATED IN AN INQUIRY BY FLORIDA OFFICIALS BUT THAT HE ISN'T AWARE THE MATTER HAS BEEN REFERRED TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE
48uc040j IN ANY CASE HE SAYS SPORT ABOUT'S PROBLEMS WILL BE CURED BY THE PUBLIC OFFERING AND ARE COMMONPLACE IN ANY RAPIDLY GROWING FRANCHISE BUSINESS <NOISE>
48uc040k WHERE CAN WE FIND SOME CLUES TO THE ANSWER OR AT LEAST A POSSIBLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION
48uc040l <NOISE> I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WE LOOK AT THE ONE MARXIST *LENINIST* STATE THAT ALREADY HAS GONE QUITE FAR DOWN THE REVISIONIST ROAD
48uc040m I REFER TO THE CURIOUSLY NEGLECTED INSTANCE OF YUGOSLAVIA
48uc040n OUTSIDE OF THE CONGRESSIONAL LEADERSHIP PATIENCE IS WEARING THIN ON PORK BARRELING CONTINUING RESOLUTIONS
48uc040o THERE ARE EVEN CONGRESSMEN WHO SAY THAT THEY WANT TO PASS SEPARATE BUDGET BILLS THIS YEAR
48uc040p WE'LL SEE
48uc040q WHAT SEEMS MORE LIKELY IS THAT EITHER A PRESIDENT OR THE COURTS OR BOTH SOMEDAY WILL HAVE TO RESCUE THE VETO BY FORCING CONGRESS TO GIVE UP ITS ARROGANT WAYS
48uc040r SO FAR WE'VE FOUND THAT FEDERAL EMPLOYEES HAVE DEALT WITH THIS ISSUE WITH A GREAT DEAL OF SENSITIVITY AND COMMON SENSE MRS. HORNER SAID
48uc040s BUT THERE IS A NEED FOR CLARITY
48uc040t THESE GUIDELINES WILL SERVE AS *REASSURANCE* TO OUR MANAGERS
48uc040u SENATOR BENTSEN'S CORPORATE TAX PROPOSAL WOULD REPLACE A PROVISION IN THE COMMITTEE BILL ALLOWING THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE TO WITHHOLD REFUNDS FROM TAXPAYERS WHO HAVE DEFAULTED ON GOVERNMENT LOANS
48uc040v THIS PROVISION WOULDN'T RAISE ANY MONEY IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR AND SENATOR BENTSEN WANTED SOMETHING THAT WOULD ALLOW A QUICKER END TO THE DIESEL TAX COLLECTION
48uc040w THE TEXAS DEMOCRAT PLANS TO OFFER HIS SUBSTITUTION WHEN THE TAX PACKAGE REACHES THE SENATE FLOOR
48uc040x MAKERS WORLD WIDE HAVE BEEN RACING TO DEVELOP COMPACT DISK RECORDERS
48uc040y MANY BIG JAPANESE STEREO MAKERS INCLUDING NAMES LIKE S:ANYO AND SONY HAVE BEEN WORKING FOR YEARS TO DEVELOP SOMETHING AKIN TO TANDY'S NEW TECHNOLOGY
48uc040z LIKE TANDY'S THOSE MACHINES ARE ABOUT TWO YEARS AWAY ANALYSTS SAY
48uc0410 COMPACT DISK RECORDERS THAT STORE COMPUTER DATA RATHER THAN SOUND ARE EXPECTED OUT THIS YEAR
48uc0411 UNION PACIFIC CORPORATION HAS ROLLED TWO CLUB CARS INTO TOWN TO ENTERTAIN DEMOCRATS
48uc0412 THE COMPANY IS HEADED BY DREW LEWIS FREQUENTLY A TROUBLESHOOTER FOR THE REPUBLICANS
48uc0413 THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS IS THROWING SEVERAL PARTIES AND PROUDLY BOASTS THAT EIGHTY NINE OF ITS MEMBERS ARE DELEGATES OR *ALTERNATES* TO THIS CONVENTION
48uc0414 DISCUSSION OF THIS SUBJECT BETTER DESCRIBED AS BROODING ABOUT IT I- IS FILLED WITH MISCONCEPTIONS
48uc0415 ONE OF THESE IS THE GREAT CONCERN WITH THE U. S. HAVING BECOME A NET DEBTOR
48uc0416 WHAT IS MEANT BY THIS IS THAT AMERICANS APPARENTLY OWN FEWER ASSETS ABROAD THAN FOREIGNERS OWN IN THE U. S.
48uc0417 MANY PEOPLE HAVE POINTED OUT THAT THESE CALCULATIONS ARE SPURIOUS BECAUSE THE ASSETS ARE NOT ALL VALUED ON THE SAME BASIS
48uc0418 IF ALL ASSETS WERE VALUED AT TODAY'S PRICES THE NET DEBT OF THE U. S. WOULD CERTAINLY BE SMALLER THAN IT NOW APPEARS AND MIGHT BE A NET ASSET
48uc0419 INVESTORS TAKING PART IN THE FINANCING WILL LEND VENEZUELA ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN EXCHANGE FOR MONTHLY PAYMENTS FROM THE NEW YORK TRUST FUND
48uc041a THOSE PAYMENTS WILL BE SET WHEN THE FINANCING IS COMPLETED WHICH IS EXPECTED IN MID DECEMBER
48uc041b THE INTEREST RATE WILL BE BASED ON THE FIVE YEAR U. S. TREASURY BOND RATE PLUS A STILL UNDECIDED INTEREST RATE MARGIN THE VENEZUELAN OFFICIAL SAID <NOISE>
48uc041c INVESTORS CONTINUE TO FLOCK TO THE MORE CONSERVATIVE STOCK PORTFOLIOS
48uc041d GROWTH AND INCOME FUNDS WHICH COMBINE HEFTY DIVIDENDS WITH THE GOAL OF CAPITAL APPRECIATION LED ALL OTHER STOCK FUND CATEGORIES IN SALES FOR JUNE
48uc041e AMONG BOND FUNDS LONG TERM MUNICIPAL FUNDS CAPTURED THE SPOTLIGHT
48vc0201 I'M VERY NERVOUS BECAUSE MY VIEW ON RATES IS SO CLOSE TO THE CONSENSUS EDWARD HYMAN OF CYRUS J. LAWRENCE INCORPORATED SAYS
48vc0202 REMEMBER THE CONSENSUS USUALLY IS WRONG
48vc0203 THE MARKETS SEEM DETERMINED TO MAKE AS MANY ECONOMISTS LOOK AS STUPID AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN
48vc0204 I WAS STARTLED STARTLED ISN'T THE WORD REACTED ALVIN NOVICK A BIOLOGY PROFESSOR AT YALE UNIVERSITY
48vc0205 HE WARNED THAT FORCED TESTING SUCH AS CONTEMPLATED BY THE CENTERS WOULD DRIVE HOMOSEXUALS UNDERGROUND AND AWAY FROM COOPERATION WITH PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAMS
48vc0206 RATIONAL PEOPLE WON'T COOPERATE IN RUINING THEIR OWN LIVES HE SAID
48vc0207 LOCAL NEWSPAPERS YESTERDAY SAID THE GOVERNMENT MAY QUALIFY THE DECISION TO SIGN THE RESTRUCTURING AGREEMENT
48vc0208 BUT OFFICIAL SOURCES SAID THE SIGNING IS LIKELY TO TAKE PLACE DURING THE LAST WEEK IN SEPTEMBER
48vc0209 THE SIGNING DEADLINE IS OCTOBER FIRST <NOISE>
48vc020a OTHER TOY MAKERS SUCH AS MATTEL INCORPORATED HAVE BEEN BRINGING OUT NEW PRODUCTS EARLIER IN THE YEAR TO INCREASE SALES AT TIMES OTHER THAN CHRISTMAS
48vc020b BUT TYCO'S DAY AFTER CHRISTMAS LAUNCH IS UNUSUAL
48vc020c THE TOY BUSINESS IS RIPE FOR SOME MARKETING INNOVATION AFTER TWO YEARS OF RELATIVELY FLAT SALES SAYS RICK ANGUILLA EDITOR OF TOY AND HOBBY WORLD MAGAZINE
48vc020d IF TYCO SUCCEEDS OTHERS WILL CERTAINLY FOLLOW
48vc020e <NOISE> NO ONE SEEMS QUITE SURE HOW THE PUBLISHER JUGGLES HIS ASSETS AMONG HIS VARIOUS COMPANIES WHICH INCLUDE THE PUBLICLY OWNED MAXWELL COMMUNICATION CORPORATION AND VARIOUS PRIVATE ONES
48vc020f CONTROL OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY AND OF PRIVATE INTERESTS LIKE MIRROR GROUP NEWSPAPERS LIMITED RESTS WITH A FOUNDATION IN LIECHTENSTEIN PERGAMON HOLDING FOUNDATION ABOUT WHICH LITTLE IS DISCLOSED
48vc020g HE SAYS ITS BENEFICIARIES ARE CHARITIES WHICH HE PROMISES TO IDENTIFY SOMEDAY SOON
48vc020h THE BANK OF ITALY ALSO REPORTEDLY SOLD MARKS TO BUY ITALIAN LIRE
48vc020i THE TRANSACTIONS MAY HAVE BEEN DIRECTED MAINLY AT DEFENDING THE SAGGING LIRA IN THE EUROPEAN MONETARY SYSTEM IN WHICH EIGHT EUROPEAN CURRENCIES FLOAT WITHIN SPECIFIED LIMITS
48vc020j BUT THEY ALSO HAD EFFECT OF HELPING THE DOLLAR BY INCREASING THE SUPPLY OF MARKS IN THE MARKET
48vc020k FOR ENVIRONMENTAL TREATMENT WHICH LIKE MR. KIRK RELISHES AN EXTREMELY LOW PROFILE THE OIL SPILL HAS BROUGHT A WAVE OF ATTENTION
48vc020l IN FACT WHEN WALL STREET LEARNED THAT THE PUBLICLY HELD COMPANY WAS HIRED TO HANDLE THE MULTIMILLION DOLLAR CLEANUP <NOISE> THE CONCERN'S STOCK SHOT UP ALMOST TEN PERCENT
48vc020m YESTERDAY IN NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE COMPOSITE TRADING ITS STOCK CLOSED AT TWELVE DOLLARS DOWN TWENTY FIVE CENTS
48vc020n STATE WORKERS ARE ANOTHER CONSTITUENCY
48vc020o ONE IN FOUR WORKING PANAMANIANS OWES HIS LIVELIHOOD TO THE GOVERNMENT AND THE GENERAL EXPECTS HELP FROM ALL OF THEM
48vc020p DOWN THE STREET FROM MR. SANCHEZ'S SHOP CARLOS A GOVERNMENT MECHANIC SAYS HE GOES TO MANY PRO NORIEGA DEMONSTRATIONS
48vc020q THE IMPACT WILL BE ENORMOUS
48vc020r THE REPUBLICANS' STRONGEST CASE AGAINST THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE HIS NAIVETE ON NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUES WILL DISAPPEAR
48vc020s THE SUSPICION OF A SELECTION BASED ENTIRELY ON POLITICAL INSTEAD OF *SUBSTANTIVE* GROUNDS WILL BE UNDERCUT
48vc020t AND A MESSAGE THAT THE CURRENT VICE PRESIDENT IS LARGELY IRRELEVANT WILL BE STRONGLY DELIVERED
48vc020u MR. TUCKER'S HARD HITTING CAMPAIGN HAS IN TURN APPALLED TOP UNION LEADERS WHO SAY HE HAS TARNISHED THEIR REPUTATION AS ONE OF THE LABOR MOVEMENT'S CLEANEST ORGANIZATIONS
48vc020v STATEMENTS OF AN UNDEMOCRATIC UNION BEING IN BED WITH MANAGEMENT HURT THIS UNION SAID MR. BIEBER
48vc020w I RESENT THOSE STATEMENTS
48vc020x <NOISE> MR. DELCHAMPS SAID THIRTY PERCENT OF THE COMPANY'S STOCK OUTSTANDING IS HELD BY PEOPLE WHO HAVE AGREED NOT TO SELL THEIR HOLDINGS BEFORE OCTOBER THIRTY FIRST
48vc020y ANOTHER TWENTY FIVE PERCENT IS HELD UNDER THE COMPANY'S EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN
48vc020z <NOISE> MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN THE FORMER CATEGORY ARE EXPECTED TO EXTEND THE NO SELL AGREEMENT FOR ANOTHER YEAR HE SAID
48vc0210 O. T. C. BROKERS ALSO STRESS THAT THEIR STOCKS OFTEN OUTPERFORM LISTED ONES ON A LONG TERM BASIS
48vc0211 AND OVERALL THE NASDAQ COMPOSITE INDEX IS UP THIRTEEN PERCENT THIS YEAR TWICE AS MUCH AS THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE
48vc0212 ALSO THEY NOTE THE TINY STOCKS THAT GENERALLY TRADE UNDER THREE DOLLARS A SHARE HAVE ALWAYS TAKEN A BIG PERCENTAGE MOVES UP OR DOWN WHEN THEY MOVE AT ALL
48vc0213 THESE MIXED FEELINGS OF FRUSTRATION WITH AND GRATITUDE TOWARD AUTHORITIES ARE PART OF THE EVERYDAY LIFE OF A FOREIGNER DOING BUSINESS IN KOREA
48vc0214 IN FACT SUCH CONTRADICTIONS ARE WHAT SEEM TO MAKE THE KOREAN WORLD GO ROUND
48vc0215 A WESTERN BUSINESSMAN NEEDS TO BE READY FOR THEM
48vc0216 HERE ARE A FEW HARD LEARNED FACTS OF KOREAN BUSINESS LIFE
48vc0217 THERE ARE ALSO BROKER FINDERS THAT GET FEES MERELY FOR MATCHING BORROWERS AND LENDERS OF STOCK
48vc0218 BROKER FINDERS CAN ALSO INCLUDE THE BROKERAGE FIRMS THEMSELVES
48vc0219 THE GOVERNMENT IS INVESTIGATING WHETHER ALL THE PAYMENTS THAT FLY TO AND FROM SUCH BROKER FINDERS ARE LEGITIMATE
48vc021a WE ARE EXTREMELY SELECTIVE SAID PAUL SUCKOW DIRECTOR OF FIXED INCOME AT OPPENHEIMER MANAGEMENT CORPORATION
48vc021b I DON'T THINK SOME ISSUES ARE GOING TO MAKE IT HE SAID
48vc021c EVEN CAUTIOUS MANAGERS SUCH AS MR. SUCKOW ARE SEEING THE IMPACT OF THE CAMPEAU DEBACLE
48vc021d HE SAID HIS FIRM OWNS A SMALL AMOUNT OF THE FEDERATED SENIOR DEBT <NOISE>
48vc021e ALTHOUGH THE BONDS ARE SECURED BY BANK CREDITS THEY HAVE ALSO FALLEN IN PRICE RECENTLY
48vc0301 THE COMPUTER ALSO CAN DISPLAY A PATTERN SHOWING HOW PEOPLE NORMALLY PLACE THE TONGUE TO PRODUCE SAY AN S. SOUND
48vc0302 A DEAF PERSON CAN THEN TRY TO MATCH THE PATTERN BY PLACING THE TONGUE AGAINST THE ELECTRONIC PALATE
48vc0303 <NOISE> WITH CAREFUL COACHING AND TRIAL AND ERROR CHILDREN LIKE MISS GILROY CAN LEARN HOW TO MAKE SOUNDS THAT REQUIRE PLACING THE TONGUE AGAINST THE ROOF OF THE MOUTH
48vc0304 THE TRASH
48vc0305 PROOFS OF PURCHASE AND SALES RECEIPTS THAT HAD BEEN TURNED IN FOR CONSUMER PRODUCT REBATES AND ALREADY PAID
48vc0306 THE WOMEN RESUBMITTED THOUSANDS OF THE REBATES AND CAMOUFLAGED THEIR TRAIL BY VARYING THEIR NAMES AND USING POSTAL BOXES ALL OVER THE COUNTRY
48vc0307 ROADRUNNER ENTERPRISES INCORPORATED SOLD ONE MILLION TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND COMMON SHARES AT TEN DOLLARS TWENTY FIVE CENTS EACH ALEX
48vc0308 BROWN AND SONS INCORPORATED LEAD UNDERWRITER SAID
48vc0309 THE ALBUQUERQUE NEW MEXICO BASED TRUCKING CONCERN SOLD ONE MILLION SHARES AND HOLDERS SOLD THE REST
48vc030a PROCEEDS TO THE COMPANY WILL BE USED TO PAY DEBT
48vc030b IN NATIONAL OVER THE COUNTER TRADING YESTERDAY ITS COMMON CLOSED AT TEN DOLLARS THIRTY SEVEN AND A HALF CENTS A SHARE UP TWELVE AND A HALF CENTS
48vc030c WITHIN TWO HOURS DAYTON HUDSON COMMON HIT FIFTY NINE DOLLARS A SHARE ON THE BIG BOARD AND UP TO SIXTY THREE DOLLARS IN OTHER MARKETS
48vc030d PEOPLE TOOK POSITIONS IN THE STOCK SIMPLY ON THE RUMOR OF A TAKEOVER BY SOMEONE NO ONE HAD EVER HEARD OF
48vc030e SOME OF THE FULL TIME RISK TAKERS DON'T EVEN NEED PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS TO PLUNGE
48vc030f NOR DO THEY REQUIRE INSIDE INFORMATION A LA IVAN *BOESKY* WHO WAS VENAL BUT NOT INSANE
48vc030g THE PEOPLE WHO INVESTED IN DAYTON HUDSON HOWEVER WERE MAD
48vc030h SOMEBODY DANGLED A FANTASY IN FRONT OF THESE SUPPOSEDLY SAVVY GUYS AND THEY WENT FOR IT LIKE TROUT TO THE FLY
48vc030i SELLING THE CANADIAN BUSINESS WILL HELP T. L. C. GROUP COMPLETE ITS FINANCING ON THE REST OF BEATRICE INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS
48vc030j T. L. C. GROUP SAID YESTERDAY THAT IT HAS A FIRM COMMITMENT FROM DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT INCORPORATED <NOISE> <NOISE> ITS INVESTMENT *BANKER* TO FINANCE ITS ACQUISITION
48vc030k A DREXEL SPOKESMAN SAID HE EXPECTS THE FINANCING TO COME THROUGH A COMBINATION OF BANK LOANS AND HIGH YIELD BONDS
48vc030l DREXEL FINANCED THE KOHLBERG KRAVIS BUY OUT OF BEATRICE LAST YEAR
48vc030m <NOISE> MR. LAY SAID THE LOSSES OCCURED IN LATE SEPTEMBER AND EARLY THIS MONTH A TIME OF PARTICULAR VOLATILITY IN OIL MARKETS
48vc030n THERE WERE TWO SENIOR PEOPLE COLLUDING AND KEEPING A SEPARATE SET OF BOOKS APART FROM THE OFFICIAL BOOKS FOR A FEW WEEKS MR. LAY SAID
48vc030o THEIR GUESSES WERE WRONG ON BOTH SIDES OF THE MARKET
48vc030p IN A STATEMENT TIMEPLEX SAID ITS DIRECTORS VOTED TO POSTPONE THE ANNUAL MEETING <NOISE> WHICH WAS SCHEDULED FOR YESTERDAY
48vc030q A NEW DATE HASN'T BEEN SET
48vc030r <NOISE> A UNISYS SPOKESMAN SAID THE COMPANIES HOPE TO COMPLETE THE *ACQUISITION* WHICH REQUIRES *TIMEPLEX* HOLDERS' APPROVAL AND GOVERNMENT CLEARANCE IN ABOUT FOUR MONTHS
48vc030s AT THE MEETING SHAREHOLDERS APPROVED AN INCREASE IN AUTHORIZED COMMON SHARES TO TWENTY MILLION FROM FIFTEEN MILLION
48vc030t THE ADDITIONAL SHARES MAY BE USED FOR BENEFIT PLANS TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING OR TO MAKE ACQUISITIONS
48vc030u THE COMPANY HAS ABOUT TEN POINT EIGHT MILLION COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING
48vc030v THE UNITED STATES OF COURSE HAS A VAST AND IN MANY PLACES EFFICIENT INFRASTRUCTURE
48vc030w THE COUNCIL STUDY PUT A VALUE OF ONE TRILLION DOLLARS ON THE PARTS IT MEASURED
48vc030x <NOISE> BUT GOVERNMENT OWNED FIXED CAPITAL SUFFERS ALONG WITH PRIVATELY OWNED PLANT AND EQUIPMENT WHEN ECONOMIC POLICIES DISCOURAGE LONG TERM INVESTMENT
48vc030y THE GREATEST SCOURGE OF INVESTMENT IS OF COURSE INFLATION WHICH EXPLAINS WHY THE NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE SUFFERED PARTICULARLY DURING THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES
48vc030z USER FEES SIMPLY COULD NOT KEEP UP WITH THE SOARING COSTS OF LOANS AND CONSTRUCTION
48vc0310 HIGHWAY CONSTRUCTION HAD THE ADDED PROBLEM OF REDUCED YIELDS FROM GASOLINE TAXES BROUGHT ABOUT BY ENERGY SHORTAGES AND SHORTAGE ENFORCED CONSERVATION
48vc0311 THE MEASURE WAS A BOLD MOVE FOR A PRESIDENT WHO HAS TO COME TO VIEW INERTIA AS THE BEST FORM OF SECURITY
48vc0312 THE SUSPENSION EFFECTIVELY WILL SLASH SALARIES AND CUT AN ESTIMATED EIGHT POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS FROM FEDERAL SPENDING THIS YEAR
48vc0313 THE AIM IS TO HOLD THE BUDGET DEFICIT TO FOUR POINT NINE PERCENT OF ECONOMIC OUTPUT DOWN FROM A PROJECTED SEVEN PERCENT
48vc0314 THIS IT IS HOPED WILL HELP STOP HIGH INFLATION FROM SPIRALING INTO HYPERINFLATION
48vc0315 THE THINK TANK MEASURED EXPENSE RATIOS WHICH ARE A FUND'S OPERATING COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF ASSETS
48vc0316 FOR INVESTORS HIGH RATIOS ARE CLEARLY OF CONCERN
48vc0317 IT CUTS INTO POTENTIAL RETURN EVEN WHEN A FUND IS DOING WELL
48vc0318 AND IT LEAVES A FUND WITH LESS OF A CUSHION IN CASE PERFORMANCE SOURS
48vc0319 ALMOST UNNOTICED IN THE DISCUSSIONS OF THE PROCUREMENT SCANDAL IS THE FACT THAT THIS ELABORATE INDEED TORTUOUS SYSTEM SEEMS TO HAVE WORKED AT LEAST ON ITS OWN TERMS
48vc031a NOBODY WAS ABLE TO THROW A CONTRACT DIRECTLY
48vc031b INSTEAD WHAT SEEMS CONTRACTORS SEEM TO HAVE DONE IS TO BUY INSIDE INFORMATION THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO PREPARE A BETTER PROPOSAL
48vc031c NINE MONTH RESULTS ALSO INCLUDE A TWELVE MILLION DOLLAR NET LOSS FROM THE DISPOSITION OF TRUCKING OPERATIONS
48vc031d ABOUT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS OF THE TRUCKING CHARGE WAS TAKEN IN THE THIRD QUARTER
48vc031e YEAR EARLIER RESULTS WERE RESTATED FOR ACCOUNTING CHANGES
48vc031f N. E. C. CORPORATION AS ONE EXAMPLE BEGAN DONATING MONEY TO M. I. T. IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES
48vc031g <NOISE> ONE DONATION OF ONE MILLION DOLLARS WENT TO CREATE A C. AND C. SOFTWARE PROFESSORSHIP
48vc031h C. AND C. IS THE N. E. C. CORPORATE SLOGAN IT STANDS FOR COMPUTERS AND COMMUNICATIONS
48vc0401 THE BIG PROBLEM IS THAT DOCTOR THANOS CAN NO LONGER USE SO CALLED PASSIVE LOSSES FROM THESE PROPERTIES TO OFFSET HIS SALARY OR EARNED INCOME
48vc0402 THE DISALLOWANCE OF PASSIVE LOSSES IS BEING PHASED IN OVER FIVE YEARS
48vc0403 REAL ESTATE DEPRECIATION SCHEDULES ALSO HAVE BEEN LENGTHENED REDUCING THEIR VALUE
48vc0404 WHILE THE UNITED STATES FOCUSES ON THE IRAN CONTRA HEARINGS MORE SOVIET ARMS FLOW INTO NICARAGUA
48vc0405 MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF WEAPONS WERE DELIVERED TO THE SANDINISTAS IN THE FIRST HALF OF THIS YEAR ACCORDING TO THE UNITED STATES INTELLIGENCE
48vc0406 THAT'S ABOUT NINE TIMES THE DIRECT UNITED STATES MILITARY AID PROVIDED TO THE CONTRAS IN THAT PERIOD
48vc0407 THE SOVIET EQUIPMENT IS JUST POURING IN ONE RANKING PENTAGON OFFICIAL TOLD THE A. P.
48vc0408 THE NICARAGUANS ARE CONSOLIDATING THEIR MILITARY BUILDUP AND ADDING TO IT EVERYTHING IMAGINABLE
48vc0409 ART COLLECTORS AND DEALERS HEAVED A SIGH OF RELIEF LAST NIGHT
48vc040a AFTER HIGH PRICES AND FRANTIC BIDDING AT ART AUCTIONS LAST SPRING ABOUT ONE IN FOUR WORKS DIDN'T SELL AT THE CONTEMPORARY ART AUCTION AT CHRISTIE'S
48vc040b BUT AT LEAST THE MARKET DIDN'T CRASH
48vc040c CITICORP'S LOSS FOR THE YEAR STEMMED FROM A THREE BILLION DOLLAR ADDITION IN THE SECOND QUARTER TO LOSS RESERVES FOR LOANS TO DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
48vc040d EXCLUDING ONE TIME GAINS AND LOSSES CITICORP'S NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN PROFIT WOULD HAVE BEEN ONE POINT FIFTEEN BILLION DOLLARS
48vc040e EXCLUDED ARE GAINS ON REAL ESTATE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER AND PENSION ASSETS IN THE THIRD QUARTER PLUS THE EFFECT OF THE RESERVE ADDITION
48vc040f SOME REPORTERS WERE MORE ORIGINAL
48vc040g A PAIR FROM A LOCAL PAPER ASKED EDSEL IF HE FAVORED CASINO GAMBLING IN DETROIT A CONCEPT HEAVILY PROMOTED BY MAYOR COLEMAN YOUNG
48vc040h STRANGEST INQUIRY LOBBED AT BILL WAS WHAT ROLE I SAW AT FORD FOR MY DAUGHTERS WHO ARE TWO YEARS OLD AND TWO MONTHS OLD
48vc040i I THOUGHT THAT WAS KIND OF PUTTING THE *CART* BEFORE THE HORSE I WANT TO GET THEM OUT OF KINDERGARTEN FIRST
48vc040j AND WHAT IF THE FOUNDRY CAN'T KEEP UP WITH CUMMINS'S DEMAND
48vc040k MR. PATTERSON SAYS THE ENGINE COMPANY HAS BACKUP SUPPLIERS
48vc040l BUT HE ADDS THAT BACKUP IS ALL OFFSHORE
48vc040m PEOPLE ARE SCARED SAYS RICHARD ROSS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF INVESTOR BEHAVIOR A RESEARCH ORGANIZATION IN CHICAGO
48vc040n WHEN THE MARKET GOES DOWN STOP ORDERS APPEAR LIKE CRAZY HE SAYS
48vc040o AND IN A VOLATILE UNCERTAIN MARKET LIKE THIS INVESTORS USE LIMIT ORDERS TO TRY TO MAKE SHORT TERM GAINS
48vc040p ATTENDANTS IN SEARCH OF OTHER P. S. TWO CLONES HERE HAVE TO SCOUR CAREFULLY
48vc040q ACER INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION OF TAIWAN SHOWS A MACHINE BILLED AS COMPATIBLE WITH THE BOTTOM OF THE LINE P. S. TWO MODEL THIRTY

48vc040v THEY HAVE A STRONG SENSE OF ETHICS <NOISE>
48vc040w BUT THEY SHOWED THAT BEHIND THE STAID *FACADE* THEIR MINDS WERE CLICKING
48vc040x IT DOES NOT HOWEVER SEEM REASONABLE TO THE GERMANS WHO ARE INSTEAD MULLING A TAX INCREASE TO SHORE UP A LEAKY GOVERNMENT BUDGET
48vc040y AS FOR THE UNITED STATES COMMENTS ON GERMAN INFLATION A TYPICAL GERMAN MIGHT RESPOND ZERO INFLATION
48vc040z WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT
48vc0410 BUT FRED MCINTYRE A RAILROAD WORKER IN OMAHA NEBRASKA VOWS THAT HE WILL NEVER INVEST IN THE MARKET AGAIN FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE
48vc0411 WITH GOOD REASON
48vc0412 AS BLACK MONDAY DAWNED HE HELD IN HIS BROKERAGE ACCOUNT A HANDSOME NEST EGG OF MORE THAN FOUR TIMES HIS THIRTY THOUSAND A YEAR PAY
48vc0413 THE NEXT DAY ALL OF IT WAS GONE AND HE OWED HIS BROKER MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND TO BOOT
48vc0414 DAVID MEISTER F. N. N.'S PRESIDENT ACKNOWLEDGED THE COMPANY HAS BEEN IN DISCUSSIONS WITH OTHER MEDIA CONCERNS BUT HE DECLINED TO IDENTIFY THEM
48vc0415 WE'VE SPOKEN TO VIRTUALLY EVERY COMPANY THAT YOU CAN IMAGINE PLUS A HALF DOZEN MORE YOU WOULDN'T THINK OF MR. MEISTER SAID
48vc0416 HE *DENIED* INDUSTRY SPECULATION THAT F. N. N. IS LOOKING TO SELL THE COMPANY
48vc0417 WE'RE NOT INTERESTED IN SELLING AND WE'RE NOT SOLICITING ANYTHING HE SAID <NOISE>
48vc0418 HOWEVER HE SAID THAT'S NOT TO SAY WE WOULDN'T ENTERTAIN ANY REASONABLE OFFER FOR AT LEAST A PIECE OF F. N. N.
48vc0419 <NOISE> IN A RELATED MATTER A REVIEW COMMISSION ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE ON OCTOBER EIGHTEENTH THREW OUT OSHA CITATIONS AGAINST MORRELL
48vc041a THE CITATIONS ISSUED IN APRIL NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN CHARGED RECORD KEEPING VIOLATIONS
48vc041b THE OFFICIAL DISALLOWED OSHA'S INSTANCE BY INSTANCE CITATION WHICH PROPOSED A TOTAL FINE OF SIX HUNDRED AND NINETY THOUSAND DOLLARS
48vc041c THE OFFICIAL ALSO SAID OSHA DIDN'T ISSUE THE CITATION WITHIN THE SIX MONTHS SPECIFIED BY LAW FROM THE TIME AN OFFICIAL INSPECTION BEGINS
48wc0201 TO CURB DOMESTIC CONSUMPTION AND SALVAGE THE TRADE SURPLUS BRAZIL'S ECONOMIC PLANNERS RECENTLY IMPOSED A TOUGH PACKAGE OF TAX AND PRICE INCREASES
48wc0202 THE RESULT BRAZILIANS LAST WEEK RIOTED IN THE STREETS OF BRASILIA IN THE WORST VIOLENCE IN THE COUNTRY'S CAPITAL IN ITS TWENTY SIX YEAR HISTORY
48wc0203 AND A GENERAL STRIKE HAS BEEN TENTATIVELY SET FOR DECEMBER TWELVE
48wc0204 RATES ARE DETERMINED BY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PURCHASE PRICE AND FACE VALUE
48wc0205 THUS HIGHER BIDDING NARROWS THE INVESTOR'S RETURN WHILE LOWER BIDDING WIDENS IT
48wc0206 THE PERCENTAGE RATES ARE CALCULATED ON A THREE SIXTY DAY YEAR WHILE THE COUPON EQUIVALENT YIELD IS BASED ON A THREE SIXTY FIVE DAY YEAR
48wc0207 THE LASTEST DISCLOSURES ARE AN OUTGROWTH OF THAT PROBE
48wc0208 ALREADY THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION HAS ACCUSED DELTA AIRLINES AND EASTERN AIRLINES OF ENGAGING IN UNREALISTIC SCHEDULING AT ATLANTA'S HARTSFIELD AIRPORT
48wc0209 THE CARRIERS DENY THIS BUT THE GOVERNMENT HAS EXPANDED ITS PROBE
48wc020a IT HAS ASKED SEVERAL OTHER AIRLINES TO TURN OVER THEIR ON TIME RECORDS AT DALLAS FORT WORTH CHICAGO'S O'HARE AND BOSTON'S LOGAN AIRPORTS
48wc020b IT WAS A WONDERFUL DAY FOR THE BOND MARKETS SAID MICHAEL J. CONNERY A SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF THE FINANCIAL FUTURES AT CHICAGO BASED REFCO INCORPORATED
48wc020c ALL THE APPARENT SIGNS OF INFLATION WERE DEFLATED
48wc020d AND THAT'S LED TO A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF SHORT COVERING OR TRADERS AND INVESTORS BUYING BACK SECURITIES THAT THEY BORROWED AND SOLD
48wc020e STILL WHATEVER THE RISK OF GARBAGE BURNING THE ALTERNATIVE LANDFILL IS WORSE SAYS MR. MCMANUS THE PUBLISHER OF RESOURCE RECOVERY REPORT
48wc020f INDEED MANY OLDER LANDFILLS WEREN'T PROPERLY CONSTRUCTED TO CONTAIN THE TOXIC SUBSTANCES NOW LEACHING FROM DECAYING TRASH
48wc020g IN MANY STATES WATER AND AIR QUALITY IS THREATENED
48wc020h NEW YORK CITY'S FRESH KILLS LANDFILL ON STATEN ISLAND FOR ONE DUMPS FOUR MILLION GALLONS OF TOXIC LIQUID INTO NEARBY FRESHWATER STREAMS EVERY DAY
48wc020i EVEN THE TRADITIONAL GREEN STAMP MIGHT BECOME A THING OF THE PAST
48wc020j IN RESPONSE TO CONSUMERS' COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE TASK OF PASTING IN TRADING STAMPS SPERRY AND HUTCHINSON COMPANY IS TESTING ELECTRONIC GREEN STAMPS IN SUPERMARKETS IN CONNECTICUT
48wc020k INSTEAD OF RECEIVING PAPER STAMPS CONSUMERS HAND THE CASHIER A PLASTIC CARD
48wc020l THE CARD IS INSERTED INTO A TERMINAL THAT AUTOMATICALLY RECORDS THE NUMBER OF STAMPS ACCRUED
48wc020m RORER GROUP WHOSE STOCK EASED THREE EIGHTHS TO THIRTY FIVE AND THREE QUARTERS SAID IT SIGNED A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE A. H. ROBINS
48wc020n THE AGREEMENT IS A KEY PART OF ROBINS'S BANKRUPTCY REORGANIZATION PLAN
48wc020o ROBINS JUMPED ONE AND A HALF TO TWENTY ONE
48wc020p BUT WHILE NICKEL AND ESPECIALLY COPPER QUOTES HAVE SINCE REBOUNDED ALUMINUM PRICES HAVE CONTINUED TO TUMBLE
48wc020q IT SEEMS TO BE IN PEOPLE'S INTEREST TO KEEP THE PRICE DOWN RIGHT NOW SAYS ONE LONDON EXCHANGE TRADER
48wc020r THIS WILL ULTIMATELY GIVE THEM MORE BUYING OPPORTUNITIES DOWN THE LINE
48wc020s SOURCES SAID AN ANNOUNCEMENT WILL BE MADE THIS MORNING IN TORONTO FOLLOWED BY A NEWS CONFERENCE
48wc020t BURNS FRY'S ABOUT SEVENTY MEMBER BOARD YESTERDAY WAS PRESENTED WITH THE PROPOSAL BY ITS ELEVEN MEMBER EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE WHICH ALREADY HAS APPROVED THE TRANSACTION <NOISE>
48wc020u SECURITY PACIFIC'S BOARD APPROVED THE TRANSACTION AT A MEETING A FEW DAYS AGO THE SOURCES SAID
48wc020v THE EXPECTED FOURTH QUARTER RESULT WOULD GIVE THE COMPANY A PROFIT OF TEN TO TWELVE CENTS A SHARE FOR ALL OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
48wc020w IT POSTED A PROFIT OF TWENTY SEVEN CENTS A SHARE FOR NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX INCLUDING ABOUT FOURTEEN CENTS A SHARE FOR AN ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENT
48wc020x THE COMPANY DIDN'T MAKE ESTIMATES FOR NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN NET INCOME
48wc020y AT SCHWAB THE NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT CAPITAL BUDGET IS ABOUT TWENTY PERCENT LESS THAN THE AMOUNT BEING SPENT THIS YEAR ACCORDING TO LAWRENCE STUPSKI SCHWAB'S PRESIDENT
48wc020z BEFORE THE CRASH SCHWAB EXPECTED TO OPEN THIRTY NEW OFFICES IN THE NEXT TWO YEARS
48wc0210 BUT MR. STUPSKI SAID THAT NUMBER HAS BEEN CUT ABOUT FIFTY PERCENT BECAUSE OF THE OUTLOOK FOR LOWER VOLUMES
48wc0211 OFF THE HOOK THE RESIGNATION OF JUSTICE DEPARTMENT CRIMINAL DIVISION CHIEF WELD ERASES RHODE ISLAND REPRESENTATIVE SAINT GERMAIN'S RISK OF INDICTMENT FOR TAKING MEALS FROM LOBBYISTS
48wc0212 AGENCY LAWYERS WHO RAN A GRAND JURY INVESTIGATION URGED NO ACTION CITING HOUSE RULES ALLOWING NEARLY UNLIMITED ENTERTAINMENT
48wc0213 WELD WAS RELUCTANT TO DROP THE CASE
48wc0214 <NOISE> ROBERT RAVITZ A GREY SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT SAYS THE AGENCY DID THE BEST IT COULD BASED ON DRAWINGS OF THE COIN
48wc0215 RESPONDING TO MISS JONES'S COMMENTS HE SAYS I DON'T KNOW WHAT HER PROBLEM IS WITH THE ARTWORK
48wc0216 IT WAS AN INCREDIBLE TIME CRUNCH
48wc0217 IF WE HAD LONGER TIME I'M SURE WE COULD HAVE MASSAGED THE ARTWORK TO DEATH
48wc0218 SO FAR THE ADMINISTRATION HAS IGNORED THESE APPEALS AND SO HAVE MR. REED AND OTHER BANKERS
48wc0219 IT SEEMS THAT THE PRINCIPLES ENUNCIATED AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS DECADE BY MESSRS.
48wc021a WRISTON AND THEOBALD STILL PREVAIL IF NOT IN LENDING OF THE BANK'S MONEY AT LEAST IN SUGGESTING THAT OTHER INVESTORS PUT UP THE CASH
48wc021b BUT EXPERIENCE SHOWS THAT ONCE AN UPSCALE PRODUCT PUTS ITS NAME ON LOWER PRICED GOODS IT CAN NEVER GO BACK UP
48wc021c REVLON GROUP INCORPORATED FOR EXAMPLE IS MAKING A LONG SHOT ATTEMPT TO REKINDLE THE HALSTON FLAME
48wc021d <NOISE> REVLON OWNER OF HALSTON ENTERPRISES INCORPORATED HAS VISIONS OF SEEING HALSTON LABEL CLOTHES BACK IN THE BETTER DRESS DEPARTMENTS
48wc021e BUT *MARKETERS* BELIEVE THE COMPANY HAS A CREDIBILITY PROBLEM AFTER ITS SIX YEAR ASSOCIATION WITH THE RETAILER J. C. PENNEY COMPANY WHICH ENDED LAST YEAR
48wc0301 BUT WHEN L. B. O. COMPANIES SELL STOCK THE BIG WINNERS USUALLY ARE A TIGHT CIRCLE OF EXECUTIVES AND INVESTMENT BANKERS WHO EARLIER BOUGHT CONTROL
48wc0302 PROFITS OFTEN EXCEED TEN TIMES THESE INVESTORS' ORIGINAL STAKE
48wc0303 THESE GIANT CONCENTRATED PAYOFFS FROM L. B. O.S ARE STARTING TO ANGER MAINSTREAM INVESTORS AND WORRY ACADEMICS
48wc0304 <NOISE> IT'S INCONCEIVABLE THAT THE DIRECTORATE DIDN'T KNOW (BRACE ABOUT MR. RODRIGUEZ )CLOSE-BRACE COMMENTS ONE INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS WORKER WHO HAS STUDIED THE LOCAL REFUGEE SITUATION
48wc0305 THE PEOPLE OF EL BARILLO ARE UNDER THE BOOT
48wc0306 THEY'VE BEEN SMART ENOUGH TO SURVIVE
48wc0307 THEY'VE ADAPTED
48wc0308 THE NEW TAX LAW'S LIMITS ON RETIREMENT BENEFITS FOR EXECUTIVES SPUR GREATER INTEREST IN CERTAIN TRUSTS THAT HELP SAFEGUARD DEFERRED COMPENSATION UNTIL RETIREMENT TIME
48wc0309 SUCH TRUSTS AREN'T COMPLETELY INVIOLATE CREDITORS CAN CLAIM THE MONEY AFTER A BANKRUPTCY FOR INSTANCE
48wc030a BUT THEY ARE CONSIDERED BETTER THAN A MERE PROMISE TO THE EXECUTIVE
48wc030b THE DRUG AZIDOTHYMIDINE OR A. Z. T. IS THE FIRST PRESCRIPTION DRUG FOR ACQUIRED IMMUNE DEFICIENCY SYNDROME TO GET FEDERAL FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION APPROVAL
48wc030c A. Z. T. IS MARKETED UNDER THE NAME RETROVIR BY BURROUGHS WELLCOME COMPANY AT AN ANNUAL RETAIL DOSAGE COST OF ABOUT TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS
48wc030d IT IS ALSO THE MOST EXPENSIVE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PROMPTING FEARS THAT SOME INSURERS WHO NORMALLY PROVIDE PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE WILL BALK AT ITS PRICE
48wc030e NOW THE ISSUE IS IN THE HOUSE'S LAP
48wc030f THE TEMPORARY BAN ON NEW BANKING POWERS IS A PROVISION IN THE SENATE VERSION OF A BILL TO RECAPITALIZE THE INSOLVENT FEDERAL SAVINGS AND LOAN INSURANCE CORPORATION
48wc030g THE HOUSE F. S. L. I. C. MEASURE DOESN'T HAVE ANY OTHER PROVISIONS
48wc030h IN ADDITION BY CONSENTING TO RORER'S BID ROBINS MAY HAVE PUT ITSELF UP FOR SALE
48wc030i THE WHOLE THING COULD STILL DETERIORATE INTO AN AUCTION SAID A LAWYER WHO WAS INVOLVED IN THE MANVILLE CORP. BANKRUPTCY LAW CASE
48wc030j OTHER BIDDERS COULD COME IN
48wc030k CALIFORNIANS WERE ASKED HOW THE STATE SHOULD GET RID OF ITS HEFTY BUDGET SURPLUS NOW ESTIMATED AT ONE POINT ONE BILLION
48wc030l BY A TWO TO ONE MARGIN REGISTERED DEMOCRATS SURVEYED BY THE FIELD INSTITUTE FAVORED GIVING THE MONEY TO PUBLIC SCHOOLS
48wc030m BUT THE STATE CONSTITUTION MAY REQUIRE THE MONEY TO BE RETURNED DIRECTLY TO TAXPAYERS
48wc030n THAT APPEARS MORE IN LINE WITH REPUBLICAN THINKING
48wc030o REPUBLICANS ASKED HOW TO DISBURSE THE SURPLUS SPLIT FIFTY FIFTY BETWEEN SCHOOLS AND PERSONAL TAX REBATES
48wc030p HARRY TRUMAN WHISTLE STOPPED THE COUNTRY IN NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT CAMPAIGNING AGAINST A PAROCHIAL DO NOTHING CONGRESS THAT WOULD NOT ENACT HIS LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM
48wc030q HE STRUCK A CHORD IN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NOT ONLY WINNING A STUNNING UPSET BUT ALSO DEFEATING SCORES OF REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMEN IN THE PROCESS
48wc030r TRUMAN RECOGNIZED THAT PRESIDENTIAL CONTEST IS NOT JUST A RACE AMONG CANDIDATES BUT ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY TO DEBATE GREAT ISSUES SUCH AS THE PROPER SEPARATION OF POWERS
48wc030s THE CONTEST THEN ISN'T IDEOLOGICAL
48wc030t IT'S CHARACTER PERSONALITY EXPERIENCE
48wc030u IT'S CULTURAL AS MUCH AS ANYTHING ELSE
48wc030v PRESIDENT REAGAN WHO WAS IN DURHAM NORTH CAROLINA WAS CAUTIOUS ABOUT THE SOVIET OFFER
48wc030w I'M WAITING TO SEE WHAT THE CONDITIONS ARE HE SAID
48wc030x A SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL HOWEVER CALLED THE GORBACHEV STATEMENT A WATERSHED EVENT BECAUSE IT WILL INCREASE EXPECTATIONS AMONG SOVIET PEOPLE FOR WITHDRAWAL
48wc030y COMPLETION OF THE TRANSACTION WHICH ALSO REQUIRES APPROVAL BY THE REGULATORY AGENCIES AND HOLDERS OF OTHER SECURITIES MUST BE COMPLETED NO LATER THAN NOVEMBER THIRTY UNDER THE AGREEMENT
48wc030z IF IT DOESN'T CLOSE AS EXPECTED BY SEPTEMBER THIRTY THE CASH PRICE PAID BY NOVA FOR EACH POLYSAR COMMON SHARE WOULD RISE TEN CANADIAN CENTS
48wc0310 THE CASH PRICE WOULD RISE FIFTEEN MORE CENTS TO CANADIAN FOURTEEN SEVENTY FIVE A SHARE IF THE TRANSACTION CLOSES IN NOVEMBER THE SIDES SAID
48wc0311 TRANSAMERICA SAID ITS CONSUMER LENDING BUSINESS ACHIEVED RECORD RESULTS IN THE QUARTER WITH CONSUMER LOANS SECURED BY REAL ESTATE GROWING TO TWO POINT FIVE BILLION
48wc0312 ITS LEASING BUSINESS ALSO POSTED RECORD RESULTS
48wc0313 DEMAND FOR STANDARD CONTAINERS WAS HIGH BECAUSE OF STRONG WORLD TRADE TRANSAMERICA SAID
48wc0314 HOWEVER THE SAN FRANCISCO BASED COMPANY SAID ITS REAL ESTATE OPERATIONS REPORTED LOWER EARNINGS
48wc0315 THAT LEAVES THE OPTION OF A MILITARY STRIKE AT TERRORISTS OR THEIR BASES WHICH ARE MAINLY IN LEBANON'S BEKAA VALLEY AN AREA UNDER SYRIAN CONTROL
48wc0316 U. S. INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES HAVE IDENTIFIED AS POTENTIAL TARGETS THERE BUILDINGS KNOWN TO HAVE BEEN USED BY HEZBOLLAH FORCES AND THEIR MENTORS THE IRANIAN REVOLUTIONARY GUARDS
48wc0317 BUT THEY AREN'T CERTAIN WHICH FACTIONS USE WHICH BUILDINGS OR WHEN THEY ARE PRESENT
48wc0318 QUITE POSSIBLY A RECENT PROFIT SHARING BONUS HELPED
48wc0319 WE DON'T HAVE AN ELEGANT FORMULA SAYS MR. BARRON
48wc031a WE SAID WE THINK EVERYONE'S ENTITLED TO A SHARE SO HERE'S A CHECK
48wc031b NEXT YEAR IF WE DO WELL THERE MAY BE A BIGGER CHECK
48wc031c IS THIS ANY WAY TO RUN A RAILROAD
48wc031d COULD BE
48wc031e CONSUMERS MAY ALSO BE WORRIED ABOUT WHETHER AUTO MAKERS WILL CONTINUE THE GENEROUS INCENTIVE THEY'VE USED ALMOST CONTINUOUSLY OVER THE PAST YEAR TO BUOY SALES
48wc031f WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IS THE GOOD OLD BUY IN ADVANCE SYNDROME SAID JOHN QUALLS OF MICRO ECONOMICS LIMITED IN SAINT LOUIS
48wc031g MR. QUALLS EXPECTS SALES TO SAG *BADLY* IN THE FOURTH QUARTER CAUSING SUPPLIES OF UNSOLD VEHICLES TO RISE UNLESS AUTO MAKERS SHOW CONTINUED RESTRAINT IN PRODUCTION
48wc0401 THE IRANIAN CRISIS AND THE ADMINISTRATION'S UNCERTAIN GRIP ON IT HAS *REAWAKENED* THIS CYNICISM
48wc0402 THE POLLS SHOW MUCH OF THE PUBLIC DOES NOT BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT WHEN HE DENIES KNOWING THAT PROFITS FROM IRANIAN ARMS SALES HAD BEEN USED TO AID THE CONTRAS
48wc0403 ON THIS THE MATTER IS LIKELY TO TURN <NOISE>
48wc0404 NOT ON WHETHER THE SHIPMENTS WERE A GOOD IDEA OR ON WHETHER LAWYERS CAN FIND SOME LAW THAT HAS BEEN BROKEN
48wc0405 BUT ON WHETHER PRESIDENT REAGAN TOLD THE TRUTH WHEN HE DENIED KNOWING
48wc0406 <NOISE> INTERCO SAID THAT BECAUSE OF THE DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT ITS INTERCO SUBSIDIARY INCORPORATED UNIT TERMINATED ITS TENDER OFFER FOR ALL LANE COMMON SHARES AT FIFTY FIVE DOLLARS A SHARE
48wc0407 THE OFFER WAS SET TO EXPIRE MONDAY
48wc0408 ANY SHARES TENDERED TO INTERCO UNDER THE OFFER WILL BE RETURNED TO LANE SHAREHOLDERS INTERCO SAID
48wc0409 NEVERTHELESS FIRST OPTIONS STILL LETS CUSTOMERS SUCH AS JAMES F. HART TRADE IN NAKED OUT OF THE MONEY PUTS AND CALLS
48wc040a MR. HART SAYS FIRST OPTIONS HASN'T SOUGHT TO REIN HIM IN
48wc040b OTHER BROKERAGE FIRMS HOWEVER HAVE CURBED OR HALTED UNHEDGED OPTIONS TRADING SINCE THE CRASH
48wc040c PET OWNERS OFTEN CALL A PET PSYCHIC BECAUSE A PET IS SICK AND THEY WANT A DETAILED ACCOUNT OF HOW IT'S FEELING
48wc040d AND SOME PET PSYCHICS CLAIM THEY CAN CHAT WITH PETS FROM A DISTANCE
48wc040e FOR EXAMPLE GAY TRAVERS A FORMER PUBLICIST CALLED PET PSYCHIC PENELOPE SMITH WHEN HER CAT SEBASTIAN WAS VERY ILL
48wc040f MS. SMITH TOLD HER TO HANG UP WHILE THE PSYCHIC TALKED TO SEBASTIAN
48wc040g THREE MINUTES LATER SHE CALLED BACK WITH SOME BAD NEWS
48wc040h <NOISE> DOES THAT MEAN A CABINET POST
48wc040i YEAH SAID MR. *IACOCCA*
48wc040j MAYBE
48wc040k MORE LIKELY THOUGH MR. *IACOCCA* WOULD PREFER TO BE PART OF AN INFORMAL GROUP OF PRESIDENTIAL ADVISERS
48wc040l EARLIER THIS YEAR THE SIXTY THREE YEAR OLD EXECUTIVE SIGNED A NEW FOUR YEAR CONTRACT WITH CHRYSLER
48wc040m AND IN TUESDAY'S INTERVIEW MR. *IACOCCA* MAINTAINED THAT HE WANTS TO LEAD THE COMPANY INTO THE NINETEEN NINETIES
48wc040n NEITHER THE VOLUNTEER DOCTORS NOR THE SCIENTISTS CONDUCTING THE EXPERIMENT KNEW WHICH VOLUNTEERS WERE TAKING ACTIVE ASPIRIN AND WHICH WERE TAKING PLACEBOS
48wc040o HOWEVER A SEPARATE COMMITTEE WAS SET UP TO MONITOR THE RESULTS OF THE EXPERIMENT AS IT PROCEEDED
48wc040p IT WAS THIS COMMITTEE THAT IN DECEMBER DECIDED THAT THE BENEFITS OF THE ASPIRIN IN REDUCING HEART ATTACKS WERE SO CLEAR THAT THERE WASN'T ANY NEED TO CONTINUE THE EXPERIMENT
48wc040q IT'S A WELCOME DEVELOPMENT IN THE FACE OF VERY SIGNIFICANT INVENTORY OVERHANG SAYS MORGAN STANLEY'S MR. ROACH
48wc040r A SLOWING OF GROWTH IN PRODUCTION GIVES COMPANIES THE ABILITY TO WORK OFF SOME INVENTORY
48wc040s AND ECONOMISTS NOTE THAT THE STEADY OPERATING RATE INDICATES CONTINUED STRENGTH IN THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR
48wc040t THE FOLLOWING DAY MR. LI MARCHED TO CITY HALL HIS AGING PASTRIES IN HAND AND DUMPED THEM ON THE DESK OF THE SURPRISED MAYOR
48wc040u THE MARKETS ARE FULL OF POOR QUALITY PASTRIES MR. LI PROCLAIMED
48wc040v WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT
48wc040w IN MY ORIGINAL SQUAD I'M THE ONLY ONE LEFT UNHARMED
48wc040x IN MY PLATOON THERE'S ONLY THIRTEEN OF US
48wc040y IT SEEMS EVERYDAY ANOTHER YOUNG GUY EIGHTEEN TO NINETEEN YEARS OLD LIKE MYSELF IS KILLED IN ACTION
48wc040z AS FOR PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS WALL STREET'S EUPHEMISM FOR TRIGGER HAPPY TRADING IT'S A BIT HARDER TO GAUGE THE RISK
48wc0410 THE FIRM IS A BIG GOVERNMENT BOND TRADER AND HAS GROWN A LOT IN FOREIGN CURRENCY TRADING
48wc0411 AND AMONG MORGAN STANLEY'S BIGGEST PERCENTAGE GAINS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN WAS EQUITY PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS WHICH NEARLY TRIPLED TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY NINE MILLION IN REVENUE
48wc0412 IT'S PRETTY REASONABLE FOR PEOPLE TO TAKE A DIVE ON THIS ONE HE SAYS
48wc0413 I'M A LITTLE SCARED
48wc0414 I DON'T BLAME PEOPLE FOR NOT BEING HEROES
48wc0415 JONES INTERCABLE ALSO BOUGHT SEVERAL SYSTEMS SERVING TWELVE THOUSAND SUBSCRIBERS IN THE SOUTHWESTERN MICHIGAN AREA
48wc0416 IT MADE THE ACQUISITION ON BEHALF OF JONES CABLE INCOME FUND ONE B. C. VENTURE A JOINT VENTURE OF TWO INTERCABLE MANAGED LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS
48wc0417 THE PURCHASE WAS FROM OMEGA AFFILIATES
48wc0418 DANIEL J. GILMARTIN WAS NAMED PRESIDENT AND CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER OF FRANK'S NURSERY AND CRAFTS DETROIT A UNIT OF THIS SPECIALTY RETAILER
48wc0419 THE POSTS HAD BEEN VACANT SINCE EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
48wc041a MR. GILMARTIN HAD BEEN DIRECTOR CORPORATE PLANNING FOR THE PARENT COMPANY
48wc041b ECONOMISTS SEEK NEW METAPHORS TO REPLACE SOFT LANDING
48wc041c STEPHEN ROACH OF MORGAN STANLEY SAYS THE WHEELS HAVEN'T HIT THE RUNWAY
48wc041d KEMPER FINANCIAL SERVICES' DAVID HALE REFERS TO A SOFT TAKEOFF
48wc041e THE LATEST DATA FUEL FED WORRIES ABOUT REIGNITING INFLATION
48xc0201 <NOISE> THE DELAY IS A VICTORY ALBEIT TEMPORARY FOR MR. TRUMP WHO OWNS TWO ATLANTIC CITY CASINO HOTELS
48xc0202 BALLY'S AGREEMENT TO BUY THE GOLDEN NUGGET IS WIDELY PERCEIVED AS AN EFFORT TO SCUTTLE A TAKEOVER ATTEMPT BY MR. TRUMP
48xc0203 MR. TRUMP'S DEMAND THAT THE GOLDEN NUGGET PURCHASE BE BLOCKED CAME AS A PART OF A COUNTERSUIT HE FILED AGAINST BALLY IN DECEMBER CHALLENGING A BALLY FINANCIAL RESTRUCTURING PLAN
48xc0204 BALLY HAD EARLIER SUED MR. TRUMP ALLEGING VARIOUS SECURITIES LAW VIOLATIONS
48xc0205 THE OUTLOOK IN THE SENATE IS STILL CLOUDY AS LONG AS PRESIDENT REAGAN CONTINUES TO OPPOSE A TAX BOOST
48xc0206 STILL SENATE BUDGET WRITERS ARE INCLUDING A SIGNIFICANT REVENUE INCREASE IN THEIR DEFICIT REDUCTION PACKAGE
48xc0207 SUCH A BUDGET ITEM WOULD FORCE THE SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE TO COME UP WITH A TAX INCREASE OF SOME KIND
48xc0208 THE HYUNDAI THAT NIFTY AND CHEAP LITTLE KOREAN CAR HAS CAUGHT ON IN THE U. S. AND NO DOUBT COULD COMPETE IN ANY MARKET IN THE WORLD
48xc0209 SO OUR WILLIAM MCGURN INQUIRED INTO HOW MANY HAVE BEEN EXPORTED <NOISE> FROM KOREA TO JAPAN
48xc020a HE FOUND THAT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX THE NUMBER WAS ZERO
48xc020b THIS WAS DOWN FROM NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE WHEN EXPORTS REACHED ONE SOLD TO MITSUBISHI
48xc020c <NOISE> EXPORTS LOST TO TOUGHER COMPETITION ABROAD AND MORE IMPORTS INTO THE U. S. MARKET HAVE CAUSED MANY FARMERS TO ABANDON THEIR TRADITIONAL FAITH IN FREE TRADE
48xc020d FROM SUGAR LONG PROTECTED TO WHEAT TO FLOWERS FARMERS ARE DEMANDING THAT BORDERS BE CLOSED
48xc020e THE LOSERS PARTICULARLY IN SUGAR ARE MANY OF THE LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES WHOSE DESPERATE ECONOMIES THE U. S. GOVERNMENT IS OTHERWISE TRYING TO SALVAGE
48xc020f TOTAL PRIVATE CONSTRUCTION INCREASED ONE POINT SEVEN PERCENT IN AUGUST AFTER A ZERO POINT FOUR PERCENT DROP IN JULY
48xc020g <NOISE> OUTLAYS FOR PUBLIC BUILDING INCREASED ZERO POINT NINE PERCENT AFTER A ONE POINT TWO PERCENT RISE
48xc020h OVERALL AUGUST OUTLAYS WERE ONE POINT ONE PERCENT ABOVE A YEAR EARLIER
48xc020i THE HUGE GAP TO A LARGE EXTENT IS A PRICE PHENOMENON
48xc020j THE DOLLAR'S FALL HAS PUSHED UP THE PRICE OF IMPORTS CAUSING THE DEFICIT TO SWELL EVEN AS THE VOLUME OF NON OIL IMPORTS HAS RECEDED
48xc020k BUT LONG BEFORE NOW THESE HIGHER PRICES WERE SUPPOSED TO LEAD TO IMPROVEMENT IN THE MONTHLY MERCHANDISE TRADE DEFICIT AS WELL
48xc020l THE JOURNAL CAN NEVER BE ALL THINGS TO ALL READERS
48xc020m <NOISE> IT DOESN'T TRY TO BE
48xc020n WE ARE NOT PLANNING SPORTS SECTIONS OR LOCAL NEWS COVERAGE COLORED WEATHER MAPS OR STORIES ON EVERY MINOR CRISIS IN THE WORLD
48xc020o WE DO INTEND TO REMAIN AMERICA'S NATIONAL BUSINESS DAILY <NOISE> AND WITH OUR EXPANDING ASIAN AND EUROPEAN EDITIONS THE GLOBAL BUSINESS DAILY AS WELL
48xc020p THAT MEANS FOCUSING FIRMLY ON NEWS THAT BUSY BUSINESS PEOPLE TRULY NEED
48xc020q STILL COMPANY INSIDERS SAID THE RESTRUCTURING WAS ENTIRELY MR. AKERS'S PLAN AND WASN'T FORCED ON HIM BY THE I. B. M. BOARD
48xc020r A DIRECTOR SAID THE BOARD LEARNED OF THE PLAN AT ITS MEETING LAST TUESDAY
48xc020s JOHN FOUND EVERYTHING WAS COMING ONTO HIS DESK AND HE HAD MORE THAN HE COULD COPE WITH ANOTHER DIRECTOR SAID
48xc020t HE WANTED AN ORGANIZATION WHICH RESOLVED MORE PROBLEMS BEFORE THEY GOT TO HIM
48xc020u <NOISE> FARM FUTURES PRICES HAVE FALLEN SEVERAL TIMES IN THE PAST TWO WEEKS FOLLOWING SEVERAL WEEKS OF A DROUGHT INSPIRED RALLY
48xc020v YESTERDAY'S TRADING SEEMED TO SUPPORT THE NOTION AMONG SOME ANALYSTS THAT CORN AND WHEAT FUTURES ARE TOP HEAVY
48xc020w THE MARKET HAS BEEN OVERDONE SIGNIFICANTLY ON THE UPSIDE SAID RICHARD LOEWY SENIOR GRAIN AND OIL SEED ANALYST WITH PRUDENTIAL BACHE SECURITIES INCORPORATED
48xc020x THE PIPER HAS TO BE PAID ON THE OTHER SIDE
48xc020y MR. PEROT TOLD TEXAS OFFICIALS LAST MONTH THAT HIS NEW COMPANY WOULD BID AGAINST E. D. S. TO PROCESS ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION A YEAR IN MEDICAID CLAIMS
48xc020z THUS MR. PEROT PUT INTO PLAY A CONTRACT THAT E. D. S. HAS HELD EXCLUSIVELY SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN
48xc0210 <NOISE> THE CONTRACT EXPIRES NEXT YEAR
48xc0211 THE INDICTMENTS ALLEGE THAT MESSRS.
48xc0212 MARTINO AND ORLOFF APPROVED MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND FOR WORK DONE LARGELY BY HANLEY WORLDWIDE
48xc0213 THEY RECEIVED PAYMENTS IN CASH AND IN THE FORM OF CLOTHES CLUB MEMBERSHIPS AND PAYMENT OF PERSONAL BILLS ACCORDING TO THE CHARGES
48xc0214 N. B. C.'S T. V. COVERAGE ALSO GETS ITS SHARE OF THE BLAME
48xc0215 MARKETERS SAY IT WAS SO BLAND AND SKIPPED SO FREQUENTLY FROM ONE EVENT TO ANOTHER THAT THERE WAS LITTLE CHANCE FOR EXCITEMENT TO BUILD
48xc0216 THE CONSTANT COMMERCIAL INTERRUPTIONS WHICH LED TO RATINGS THAT WERE MUCH LOWER THAN EXPECTED DIDN'T HELP EITHER
48xc0217 THE REHABILITATION PROCESS IS CERTAINLY FURTHER ALONG
48xc0218 THERE'S LESS LOOKING BACK AND MORE LOOKING FORWARD NOW MR. LEFEVRE SAID
48xc0219 PEOPLE ARE FOCUSING MORE ON THE ELECTION AND THE POST ELECTION PERIOD WHAT IT MIGHT MEAN FOR THE ECONOMY
48xc021a ONE OF THE AFFINITY CARDS THAT CHEMICAL BANK DROPPED <NOISE> WAS MARKETED TO ALUMNI OF NEW YORK UNIVERSITY
48xc021b <NOISE> WE ARE SATISFIED WITH THE PROGRAM WHILE IT WAS RUNNING SAYS ROBERT CUNNINGHAM DIRECTOR OF ALUMNI RELATIONS AT N. Y. U.
48xc021c BUT IT ENDED AT CHEMICAL'S SUGGESTION
48xc021d WE ARE EXTREMELY SELECTIVE SAID PAUL SUCKOW DIRECTOR OF FIXED INCOME AT OPPENHEIMER MANAGEMENT CORPORATION
48xc021e <NOISE> I DON'T THINK SOME ISSUES ARE GOING TO MAKE IT HE SAID
48xc021f EVEN CAUTIOUS MANAGERS SUCH AS MR. SUCKOW ARE SEEING THE IMPACT OF THE CAMPEAU DEBACLE
48xc021g HE SAID HIS FIRM OWNS A SMALL AMOUNT OF THE FEDERATED SENIOR DEBT
48xc021h ALTHOUGH THE BONDS ARE SECURED BY BANK CREDITS THEY HAVE ALSO FALLEN IN PRICE RECENTLY
48xc0301 ANY SUCH AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE AIRLINES AND AIRPORT OPERATORS COULD BE WRITTEN INTO THE CONGRESSIONAL LEGISLATION REAUTHORIZING THE AVIATION TRUST FUND
48xc0302 THE TRUST FUND WHICH IS FINANCED BY TICKET AND FUEL TAXES HELPS PAY FOR F. A. A. OPERATIONS <NOISE> AND PROVIDES GRANTS TO AIRPORTS
48xc0303 SOME HAVE SUGGESTED THAT AIRPORT OPERATORS AS A CONDITION OF ACCEPTING THE GRANTS AGREE TO GIVE UP SOME AUTHORITY IN MAKING NOISE RULES
48xc0304 RAYTHEON DENIED THAT IT IS FREELY GIVING AWAY JOBS
48xc0305 WE AREN'T CRAZY ABOUT OFFSETS BUT WE ENTER INTO THEM AS A COMPROMISE BUSINESS ARRANGEMENT IF IT'S THE BEST THAT'S AVAILABLE SAID RAYTHEON SPOKESMAN LAWRENCE MCCRACKEN
48xc0306 HE ADDED THAT THERE WERE ALSO SOME POLITICAL AND NATIONAL SECURITY S- CONSIDERATIONS BEHIND THE DECISION TO SHARE THE PATRIOT BUSINESS WITH THE THREE U. S. ALLIES
48xc0307 TANDY MADE THE INFORMAL PRODUCT ANNOUNCEMENT AT A REGULAR GATHERING OF ABOUT TWO HUNDRED BUSINESS COMPUTER USERS <NOISE> AT THE COMPANY HEADQUARTERS
48xc0308 THE COMPANY ALSO SAID IT WOULD INTRODUCE ITS FIRST LASER PRINTER THIS YEAR
48xc0309 THE HIGH QUALITY PRINTERS ARE BECOMING A MUST COMPUTING ACCESSORY FOR BUSINESSES
48xc030a FLOATING FAILS WHEN GOVERNMENTS TRY TO ESCAPE FROM THE VERDICT OF THE EXCHANGE MARKETS <NOISE> ON THEIR POLICIES BY RESORTING TO DIRECT CONTROLS OVER TRADE AND CAPITAL FLOWS
48xc030b BECAUSE THIS LATTER THREAT IS NOW SO SEVERE THE WORLD IS RIGHT TO TALK ABOUT INTERNATIONAL MONETARY REFORM IF ONLY AS A DELAYING GAME
48xc030c BUT REALISTIC TALK SHOULD NOT DECEIVE STABILIZING EXCHANGE RATES REQUIRES DEPENDENCE AND SUBORDINATION NOT THE FREEDOM FOR EVERYBODY TO DO THEIR OWN THING
48xc030d THERE'S BEEN A COMPLETE TURNAROUND IN SHORT TERM SENTIMENT SAID THOMAS G. GIBBON A SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT AT NOMURA SECURITIES INTERNATIONAL INC.
48xc030e FOR WEEKS PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TRADING BEARISHLY ON DOLLAR WEAKNESS AND A RISE IN THE C. R. B. INDEX
48xc030f DESPITE THE REVERSAL INVESTORS STILL ARE TAKING A CAUTIOUS STANCE AND USING THE LATEST RALLY AS A SELLING OPPORTUNITY HE ADDED

490c030x HE ADDED THAT A. T. AND T. PLANS TO INCORPORATE INTO ITS UNIX ANY USEFUL FEATURES FROM ITS RIVALS' VERSION
490c030y AND MR. WATT IS ECSTATIC
490c030z YOU CAN TEACH WHOLE HISTORY LESSONS FROM THIS VILLAGE INCLUDING ARCHITECTURE SOCIOLOGY AND ART HE SAYS
490c0310 THESE WEALTHY LANDLORDS GOT BIGGER AND MORE POWERFUL AND THAT LED TO THE BREAKDOWN OF THE HAN EMPIRE
490c0311 THE OWNERS BECAME POWERFUL LORDS AND THE GUARDS IN THE TOWERS BECAME PRIVATE ARMIES
490c0312 RICK BRIGGS PRESIDENT OF THE UNION SAID FALCONBRIDGE'S LATEST PROPOSALS ON *CONTRACTING* OUT ARE NOT ENCOURAGING
490c0313 THE PROPOSALS WERE PRESENTED YESTERDAY AFTER A TWO DAY RECESS IN THE TALKS
490c0314 ABOUT FORTY PERCENT OF FALCONBRIDGE'S NICKEL OUTPUT COMES FROM ITS SUDBURY OPERATIONS
490c0315 DETAILS ARE STILL MURKY ABOUT THE REST OF THE CREDITS
490c0316 ITALIAN OFFICIALS SAY THAT ROME'S DECISION TO GRANT ABOUT A SEVEN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR GUARANTEE OF EXPORT CREDITS WAS PRIMARILY A POLITICAL RATHER THAN A BANKING DECISION
490c0317 BRITAIN'S MIDLAND BANK HAS ANNOUNCED PLANS FOR A NUMBER ONE BILLION CREDIT LINE THOUGH SOME BRITISH BANKS MAY BE GETTING COLD FEET ABOUT PARTICIPATING
490c0318 FRENCH BANKS HAVE YET TO ANNOUNCE THEIR PLANS OFFICIALLY BUT ARE SAID TO BE CONSIDERING LOANS OF TWO BILLION DOLLARS

490c031c OUTPUT OF INDUSTRIAL MATERIALS ALSO REBOUNDED IN JULY AFTER DROPPING FOR TWO MONTHS
490c031d IT'S KIND OF LIKE EATING PEANUTS ISN'T IT SAID MR. MURPHY
490c031e ONCE YOU START IT'S TOUGH TO STOP
490c031f THE UMPTEENTH SOUNDS OF LEAD SMACKING METAL AND A RIFLE BEING COCKED SERVED AS A QUICK ANSWER TO HIS QUESTION
490c0401 THEY HAVE PUT IN A LOT OF MONEY BUT IS THAT ENOUGH
490c0402 NOBODY KNOWS SAID MR. BRAY
490c0403 IN OCTOBER WE THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE ENOUGH BUT BETWEEN OCTOBER AND NOW IT'S PROVEN TO BE NOT ENOUGH
490c0404 WHO KNOWS HOW MUCH IT WILL BE
490c0405 WITH THE SPEAKER BEHIND IT GEPHARDT WILL PASS ON THE HOUSE FLOOR SAID REPRESENTATIVE DONALD PEASE DEMOCRAT FOR OHIO
490c0406 ADDED REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN DONNELLY DEMOCRAT FOR MASSACHUSETTS ON THE SPEAKER'S REMARKS IT COMES AS NO SURPRISE
490c0407 HE FEELS STRONGLY THAT OUR TRADING PARTNERS WON'T TAKE US SERIOUSLY UNLESS HIT OVER THE HEAD WITH A PROVISION LIKE GEPHARDT
490c0408 ENERGY EXPERTS CONSIDER AMOCO AND EXXON AMONG THE INDUSTRY'S HEALTHIEST COMPANIES FINANCIALLY WITH STRONG CREDIT RATINGS AND LOW DEBT
490c0409 AMOCO'S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHOW IT HAD FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN CASH AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES ON HAND AT THE CLOSE OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
490c040a IN RECENT TALKS WITH ANALYSTS AMOCO OFFICIALS HAVE SAID THE COMPANY IS WELL POSITIONED FINANCIALLY IF IT DECIDES TO MAKE AN ACQUISITION
490c040b IF THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION IS COMPLETED COCA COLA WILL BE LEFT WITH HUGE BORROWING CAPACITY
490c040c COCA COLA SAID ITS PRO FORMA DEBT WOULD BE REDUCED TO ABOUT NINE PERCENT OF TOTAL CAPITAL
490c040d THE COMPANY'S DEBT WAS TWENTY SIX PERCENT OF CAPITAL AT THE END OF THE SECOND QUARTER ITS TARGET RATIO IS THIRTY FIVE PERCENT
490c040e THE UNION SAID THE ENGINEERS WERE LEAVING THEIR VESSELS WHEN THEY DOCKED

490c040g THE UNION WHICH REPRESENTS ENGINEERS ON ABOUT EIGHTY GREAT LAKES SHIPS HAS BEEN WITHOUT A CONTRACT SINCE MAY THIRTY FIRST
490c040h THE FORECAST IS A BIT ROSIER THAN THAT OF MOST PRIVATE ANALYSTS
490c040i IN ITS LATEST SURVEY BLUE CHIP ECONOMIC INDICATORS CONSENSUS FORECAST PUTS GROWTH AT ONE POINT EIGHT PERCENT THIS YEAR
490c040j MORE THAN THREE FOURTHS OF THE ECONOMISTS POLLED EXPECT A RECESSION TO START BEFORE THE END OF NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE
490c040k AS OF APRIL FIRST ALL INTEREST INCOME WILL BE TAXED AT TWENTY PERCENT
490c040l EXEMPTIONS INCLUDE SINGLE MOTHERS THE HANDICAPPED AND THOSE OVER SIXTY FIVE YEARS OLD
490c040m OTHER EXCEPTIONS INCLUDE FUNDS SET ASIDE FOR HOUSING AND PENSIONS
490c040n THE POINT A POINT MR. CAMPBELL KEEPS RETURNING TO IS THAT EVERY RELIGION IS TRUE
490c040o IT'S TRUE AS A *METAPHOR* FOR THE HUMAN AND COSMIC MYSTERIES
490c040p IT'S ONLY WHEN YOU'RE STUCK ON THE METAPHOR THAT YOU GET IN TROUBLE
490c040q MR. HOWARD NOT ONLY HELPED THE FLEDGLING PUBLIC COMPANIES DRUM UP INTEREST IN THEIR SHARES HE HELPED INVEST THE CAPITAL THEY RAISED IN THE PUBLIC OFFERINGS
490c040r IN MANY CASES THE BANKS HE ADVISED INVESTED LARGE AMOUNTS IN EACH OTHER
490c040s AND THEY LENT FUNDS TO OTHER CLIENTS OF MR. HOWARD WHO SOMETIMES INVESTED IN THE SAME STOCKS
490c040t <NOISE> ACQUIRED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE FRIENDLY REPORTED MODEST GROWTH UNTIL LAST YEAR WHEN LABOR SHORTAGES AND LOWER CUSTOMER TRAFFIC HURT THE CHAIN
490c040u THE UNIT IMPROVED SALES WITH HIGHER PRICES NEW STORE OPENINGS AND THE ACQUISITION OF TWO SMALL RESTAURANT CHAINS DURING THE SECOND HALF OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
490c040v HOWEVER FRIENDLY'S NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN PRETAX OPERATING PROFIT OF FORTY FIVE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS WAS BELOW THE PREVIOUS YEAR'S FIFTY POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS

490c040y DIPLOMATS SAID AT LEAST EIGHT PEOPLE WERE KILLED IN THE PROTESTS
490c040z STUDENTS BUDDHIST MONKS AND OTHERS PARTICIPATED IN THE DEMONSTRATIONS
490c0410 WE'VE ALWAYS WONDERED HOW TO SQUARE NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA'S ROUGH WORDS WITH HIS SOFT TREATMENT IN THE DEMOCRATIC CONTROLLED U. S. CONGRESS
490c0411 MAYBE HE HAS TOO BECAUSE HE'S UPPED THE ANTE
490c0412 HE HAS NOW BRANDED NOT ONLY THE REPUBLICANS BUT ALSO THE DEMOCRATS AS IMPERIALISTS BECAUSE BOTH PARTIES HAVE TALKED RECENTLY ABOUT HELPING THE CONTRAS
490c0413 WHAT DO THE DEMOCRATS BECOME IF THEY ACTUALLY VOTE THE BANDAGES
490c0414 THE TREASURY IS SCHEDULED TO ANNOUNCE DETAILS OF ITS QUARTERLY FINANCING OPERATION NOVEMBER SECOND
490c0415 IT USUALLY CONSISTS OF THREE YEAR NOTES TEN YEAR NOTES AND THIRTY YEAR BONDS
490c0416 BUT THE DEPARTMENT IS VERY CLOSE TO REACHING ITS LIMIT ON ISSUING LONG TERM DEBT AND THUS HAS ASKED CONGRESS TO INCREASE ITS AUTHORITY
490c0417 CONGRESS STILL HASN'T COMPLETED WORK ON THE ISSUE WHICH IS PART OF THE TAX BILL PASSED LATE TUESDAY BY THE SENATE
490c0418 <NOISE> CLARKE SWANSON NOTING THAT NINETEEN MILLION WOMEN HAD STAYED IN THE WORK FORCE AFTER WORLD WAR TWO THOUGHT THEY COULD USE HELP IN WHIPPING UP QUICK MEALS
490c0419 SO IN NINETEEN FIFTY ONE THE SWANSON COMPANY BEGAN SELLING FROZEN POT PIES TURKEY CHICKEN AND MEAT
490c041a THE FIRST PRODUCTION ORDER CALLED FOR TWENTY THOUSAND PIES
490c041b SOON IT WAS TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND A DAY
490c041c BY NINETEEN FIFTY THREE CLARKE AND HIS BROTHER WERE READY FOR THE NEXT STEP COMPLETE FROZEN DINNERS
490c041d THOUSANDS OF AZERBAIJAN WORKERS RALLIED IN THE SOVIET REPUBLIC'S CAPITAL BAKU AFTER A DAY OF WORK STOPPAGES TO BACK DEMANDS FOR GREATER LOCAL AUTONOMY
490c041e IN ESTONIA THE COMMUNIST PARTY CHIEF URGED ETHNIC RUSSIAN WORKERS TO END A SIX DAY STRIKE OVER A NEW LAW TIGHTENING RESIDENCY REQUIREMENTS
490c041f STRIKES ALSO WERE THREATENED IN GEORGIA
491c0201 <NOISE> FIRST OF ALL THE POLICY CONSERVATIVES WILL PURSUE THEIR UNFINISHED AGENDA OF DEREGULATION IN AREAS FROM FINANCIAL SERVICES TO REGULATION AS A DRAG ON U. S. INTERNATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS
491c0202 THEY SAY THE ADMINISTRATION MISSED ITS CHANCE AND ALLOWED THE DEREGULATORY CAMPAIGN TO BE ALL BUT ABORTED BY CONTROVERSY OVER ANNE GORSUCH AND JIM WATT
491c0203 THEY THINK THEIR GENERAL CASE IN THIS AREA IS OVERWHELMING
491c0204 THEY WILL GIVE IT NEW APPLICATIONS AND CARRY IT TO NEW FORUMS
491c0205 THE NEW SERVICE DIFFERS FROM THE SHUTTLE IN SEVERAL WAYS
491c0206 IT WON'T HAVE THE BACKUP PLANES THAT THE SHUTTLE USES TO ACCOMMODATE PASSENGER OVERFLOW
491c0207 THE NEW FLIGHTS WILL INCLUDE ADVANCE SEAT SELECTION AND FIRST CLASS AND COACH SERVICE WHICH THE SHUTTLE DOESN'T
491c0208 SHUTTLE FLIGHTS DEPART ON THE HOUR THE NEW SERVICE WILL OPERATE ON THE HALF HOUR
491c0209 MR. GITTIS SAID THE LAWSUITS WOULD HAVE LITTLE INFLUENCE ON THE RESPONSE OF REVLON'S BOARD TO THE TENDER OFFICE
491c020a HE SAID MACANDREWS AND FORBES RATHER THAN REVLON IS BORROWING THE MONEY NEEDED TO ACQUIRE REVLON AND TAKE IT PRIVATE
491c020b WE'RE SELLING EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION OF NOTES IN A PRIVATE PLACEMENT HE SAID
491c020c IF WE WERE USING REVLON ASSETS THE SUITS COULD BE TROUBLESOME
491c020d STILL MR. JOSEPHS AND OTHERS THINK THAT THE CHANGES WILL BE GOOD FOR THE FARM ECONOMY IN GENERAL
491c020e <NOISE> MANY OF THESE GENTLEMEN FARMERS ARE TAX MOTIVATED NOT PROFIT DRIVEN HE SAYS
491c020f SOME ARE UNFAIR COMPETITION AGAINST THE F- REGULAR FARMER WHO'S TRYING TO MAKE A BUCK
491c020g ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO SOUTHLAND ACKNOWLEDGED THAT IT WAS CONSIDERING RESTRUCTURING ALTERNATIVES BUT WOULDN'T ELABORATE
491c020h THE OWNER AND OPERATOR OF EIGHTY TWO HUNDRED SEVEN ELEVEN STORES REPEATEDLY HAS SAID IT DIDN'T KNOW OF REASONS FOR THE HEAVY TRADING IN ITS STOCK
491c020i BUT STOCK TRADERS CONTINUED TO EXPECT SOUTHLAND TO TAKE SOME ACTION EVEN WHILE SEVERAL ANALYSTS AND INDUSTRY EXECUTIVES SAID THEY BELIEVED SOUTHLAND WOULDN'T RESPOND UNLESS A HOSTILE BIDDER EMERGED
491c020j IN KOREA LABOR CONFLICTS HAVE ADDED HEAT TO THE UNSTABLE POLITICAL SITUATION
491c020k THE NEW UNIONS ARE GROWING MORE ADVERSARIAL
491c020l COMPANIES KEEP ASKING THE GOVERNMENT TO SMASH THE UNIONS
491c020m <NOISE> BUT THE RULING PARTY CAN'T RISK ALIENATING WORKERS WHO WILL VOTE IN THE COMING ELECTIONS
491c020n IT REFUSES SO FAR TO BACKTRACK ON ITS JULY FIRST PROMISE OF GREATER DEMOCRACY OR TO RETURN TO THE POLICY OF OVERT UNION BUSTING
491c020o WORLDS OF WONDER NEEDS TO CONVINCE CREDITORS TO EXTEND IT TIME THROUGH THE CHRISTMAS SEASON WHICH IS BY FAR THE BIGGEST SALES PERIOD FOR TOY COMPANIES
491c020p IT'S IN THE CREDITORS' BEST INTEREST TO KEEP THE COMPANY GOING AT LEAST FOR NOW SAID FRED ANSCHEL AN ANALYST WITH DEAN WITTER REYNOLDS INCORPORATED
491c020q AS OF SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH THE COMPANY'S INVENTORY WAS ONE HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS A SPOKESWOMAN SAID
491c020r CONGRESS'S JOINT TAX COMMITTEE NOW IS WITHOUT A STAFF CHIEF
491c020s DAVID BROCKWAY HAS LEFT AS PLANNED TO JOIN THE WASHINGTON LAW OFFICES OF DEWEY BALLANTINE BUSHBY PALMER AND WOOD
491c020t HIS SUCCESSOR HASN'T BEEN NAMED
491c020u <NOISE> BANKAMERICA IS NOW WRITING OFF FEWER OF ITS PROBLEM LOANS THAN MOST OTHER LARGE BANKS
491c020v THE DEVELOPMENT HAS LEFT SOME ANALYSTS WONDERING WHETHER THE BANK IS BEING AGGRESSIVE ENOUGH ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING ITS RECORD OF SURPRISING LOAN PROBLEMS OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS
491c020w BUT BANK OFFICIALS SAID THEY ARE BEING PRUDENT
491c020x THEY SAID LOWER WRITE OFFS REFLECT PREVIOUS HOUSECLEANING AS WELL AS MORE CONSERVATIVE LENDING PRACTICES
491c020y IN ADDITION THE BANK HAS A BEEFED UP TEAM OF SPECIALISTS WHO ARE HAVING INCREASING SUCCESS IN RECOVERING PREVIOUSLY WRITTEN OFF LOANS
491c020z THE ONLY NEW ISSUE PRICED YESTERDAY WAS FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION OF A TWELVE YEAR SENIOR SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES FROM U. S. G. *CORPORATION*
491c0210 THE HIGH RISK HIGH YIELD ISSUE WAS PRICED AT PAR TO YIELD THIRTEEN AND A QUARTER PERCENT BY SALOMON BROTHERS INCORPORATED AND GOLDMAN SACHS AND COMPANY
491c0211 THE OFFERING IS PART OF U. S. G.'S RECAPITALIZATION PLAN
491c0212 MR. ZEHNDER PLAYS DOWN THIS CRITICISM
491c0213 HE POINTS TO THE FACT THAT CREDIT SUISSE LEADS IN THE NUMBER OF PUBLICLY LISTED BONDS LAUNCHED BUT LAGS IN THE NUMBER OF UNLISTED NOTES IT ISSUED
491c0214 THIS IS SIGNIFICANT HE SAYS BECAUSE BOND ISSUES PAY HIGHER COMMISSIONS THAN UNLISTED NOTES
491c0215 IN CONTRAST SENATOR BENTSEN CAMPAIGNED LAST WEEK IN A HALF EMPTY PLANE TO A MEASURED CADENCE
491c0216 HE PORTRAYS GOVERNOR DUKAKIS AS A PRAGMATIC CAN DO EXECUTIVE
491c0217 AND HE OFFERS HIMSELF A BUSINESS ORIENTED SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN AND FORMER INSURANCE EXECUTIVE AS EVIDENCE OF THAT MODERATION
491c0218 THE RECURRING WORDS OF HIS SPEECHES ARE THE WORDS OF THE BOARDROOM COMPETENCE HANDS ON MANAGEMENT ENHANCED RECOVERY
491c0219 MR. KIDDER INSISTS THERE IS CAUSE FOR HOPE
491c021a <NOISE> GOOD TEACHERS PUT SNAGS IN THE RIVER OF CHILDREN PASSING BY AND OVER THE YEARS THEY REDIRECT HUNDREDS OF LIVES
491c021b PERHAPS HE IS RIGHT
491c021c BUT WHAT HE NOTICES AT THE FIFTH GRADE SCIENCE FAIR SEEMS MORE SIGNIFICANT
491c021d THE RESULTS OF THAT PAINFUL CHARADE DON'T REFLECT SOCIAL STATUS ETHNIC BACKGROUND OR TEACHING TECHNIQUE THEY REFLECT THE CONTRIBUTION OF EACH CHILD'S PARENTS
491c021e AVIATION INSURANCE IS UNDER INTENSE PRESSURE
491c021f THE GLOBAL AIRLINE PREMIUMS HAVE DROPPED TO ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED MILLION FROM ABOUT ONE BILLION IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
491c021g MEANWHILE AIRLINE LOSSES IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT ROSE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE PREVIOUS YEAR
491c0301 <NOISE> THE ECONOMIC FALLOUT SHOULDN'T BE IGNORED HOWEVER
491c0302 A PROVISION IN THE SPENDING BILL REQUIRES THAT AT LEAST ONE THIRD OF THE REPAIR AND OVERHAUL WORK ON SHIPS BE DONE LOCALLY AT THEIR HOME PORTS
491c0303 THAT MAKES IT A BIG DEAL FOR TODD AND LOCKHEED MR. DICKS SAYS REFERRING TO TWO PUGET SOUND SHIPYARDS
491c0304 <NOISE> THE GOVERNMENT CIVIL SUIT ALLEGED THAT A DEFECT COULD CAUSE THE REAR BRAKES TO LOCK SENDING THE CAR SPINNING OUT OF CONTROL
491c0305 G. M. WHICH NO LONGER MAKES X. CARS DENIED THAT THE BRAKES ARE DEFECTIVE
491c0306 AGREEING WITH G. M. JUDGE JACKSON RULED THAT THE GOVERNMENT CAME TO COURT WITH NOTHING MORE ESSENTIALLY THAN A REASONABLE SUSPICION THAT A DEFECT EXISTED
491c0307 <NOISE> INCO'S STOCK HAS CAUGHT TECHNICAL ANALYSTS' ATTENTION TOO
491c0308 IT RECENTLY BROKE OUT OF A FIVE YEAR TRADING RANGE SAYS MARTIN PRING EDITOR OF PRING MARKET REVIEW
491c0309 <NOISE> HE THINKS THE STOCK COULD BE POISED FOR BIG GAINS REFLECTING WHAT MAY BE A BULL MARKET IN BASE METALS
491c030a RENT CONTROL IS AS BAD AS THE INCOME TAX DEDUCTION FOR HOME OWNERSHIP
491c030b ALL THE BENEFICIARIES OF THE DEDUCTION ARE HIGH INCOME EARNERS NOT SIMPLY SOME OF THEM
491c030c IT LEADS TO EXTRA LARGE SWIMMING POOLS EXTRA BEDROOMS IN BEVERLY HILLS BUT NO HOUSING FOR THE PEOPLE WHO NEED IT MOST
491c030d STILL WHEN THIS ISSUE WAS LAST VOTED ON IN CONGRESS EIGHTY FIVE OUT OF EIGHTY FIVE SENATORS PRESENT VOTED FOR IT
491c030e <NOISE> THE ONLY SURPRISING THING GIVEN THE NUMBER OF BENEFICIARIES IS THAT SOMEHOW THE OTHER FIFTEEN SENATORS DIDN'T MANAGE TO GET THEIR NAMES ON THE ROLL CALL
491c030f MR. ZINN SAID ENTERTAINMENT MARKETING IS STILL WEIGHING A PROXY FIGHT
491c030g IT'S A BAD FEELING IN YOUR STOMACH WHEN THE CHAIRMAN AND PREVIOUS BIDDER IS SELLING HIS BLOCK HE SAID
491c030h IT DOESN'T MAKE ME AS A SHAREHOLDER COMFORTABLE WITH WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE COMPANY
491c030i UNDER THE PLAN THE EDELMAN GROUP WOULD CONTRIBUTE ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION IN EQUITY TO THE TRANSACTION
491c030j THE REMAINDER WOULD BE FINANCED WITH DEBT AND DEBT SECURITIES
491c030k IF THE PLAN SUCCEEDS SHEARSON WOULD BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE WARRANTS TO BUY TEN TO TWENTY PERCENT OF THE FULLY DILUTED COMMON EQUITY OF THE COMPANY
491c030l FRANK PEREZ A RETIRED DIPLOMAT RECALLS THE DAY HE LEFT FOR A TWO YEAR STINT ON THE DEPUTY CHIEF OF MISSION IN TURKEY
491c030m FIDELITY'S PACKERS HE SAYS SPREAD THE PEREZ FAMILY FURNISHINGS IN THE FRONT YARD THEN LEFT FOR AN EXTENDED LUNCH BREAK
491c030n MINUTES LATER THERE WAS A DRENCHING RAIN
491c030o IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR WHEN HE RETURNED MUCH OF THE FURNITURE WAS SOGGY AND MOLDY
491c030p WHILE CHRONICLING THE DOINGS OF THE HIGHFALUTIN MAY SEEM LIGHT STUFF TO SOME MR. REVSON SAYS HIS OWN APPROACH TO THE SUBJECT MATTER ISN'T
491c030q IT ISN'T JUST THROWING TOGETHER A STRING OF NAMES AND SAYING THEY SIPPED CHAMPAGNE ATE CAVIAR AND WORE BILL BLASS THE COLUMNIST SAYS
491c030r FACTS ARE IMPORTANT
491c030s IF YOU SAY SOMEONE IS WEARING A RED TIE THEN HE SHOULD BE WEARING A RED TIE
491c030t GENLYTE DESIGNS AND MAKES LIGHTING FIXTURES AND ELECTRONIC LIGHTING CONTROLS
491c030u OTHER BAIRNCO UNITS MAKE ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS COMPOSITE MATERIALS AND ELECTROMAGNETIC SHIELDING SYSTEMS
491c030v IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN NEW YORK BASED BAIRNCO EARNED TWENTY EIGHT POINT TWO MILLION OR TWO DOLLARS AND SIXTY EIGHT CENTS A SHARE
491c030w THE KING'S REQUEST LEFT THE DELEGATES IN A TIGHT SPOT
491c030x TO IGNORE JORDAN AND MAKE A SUBSTANTIAL FORMAL CASH PLEDGE TO THE P. L. O. WOULD SIGNAL A SHIFT AWAY FROM MODERATION DIFFICULT FOR THE GULF STATES TO COUNTENANCE
491c030y BUT TO FINANCE BOTH JORDAN AND THE P. L. O. RISKED TRIGGERING A CLAMOR FROM OTHER CASH STRAPPED STATES COVERED UNDER THE BAGHDAD AGREEMENT SUCH AS LEBANON AND SYRIA
491c030z BUT OTHER EVIDENCE ON THE FLAPS IS CONFLICTING
491c0310 ONE OF THE CREW MEMBERS CAN BE HEARD ON THE COCKPIT VOICE RECORDER CALLING OUT FLAPS FIFTEEN FIFTEEN THE CORRECT POSITION FOR THE FLAPS
491c0311 AND THE RECORDER INDICATES THAT A COCKPIT ALARM THAT SHOULD HAVE ALERTED THE CREW TO IMPROPERLY SET FLAPS DIDN'T GO OFF
491c0312 WHEN THE HOUSE AND SENATE APPROVED THE TAX BILL EARLY SATURDAY LAWMAKERS DIDN'T MENTION THE LAST MINUTE PROVISIONS AND CONGRESSIONAL STAFFERS DESCRIBED THEM AS TECHNICAL
491c0313 WHILE THE ESTIMATED REVENUE OF ALMOST A HUNDRED MILLION OVER THREE YEARS IS RELATIVELY SMALL THE PROVISIONS MIGHT BE PERCEIVED AS AN ANTI TAKEOVER PUSH BY CONGRESS
491c0314 THEY COULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF SLOWING CERTAIN TAKEOVER ACTIVITY CONGRESSIONAL SOURCES ACKNOWLEDGED OVER THE WEEKEND
491c0315 <NOISE> TO BE SURE THE DEFICIT HAS DECLINED IN THE PAST FEW YEARS
491c0316 BUT THAT DECLINE IS ENTIRELY THE RESULT OF A RISING SURPLUS IN THE SOCIAL SECURITY TRUST FUND
491c0317 THAT MONEY SHOULD BE INVESTED TO HELP DEFRAY THE FUTURE RETIREMENT COSTS OF THE BABY BOOMERS INSTEAD IT IS BEING USED TO PAPER OVER THE DEFICIT
491c0318 THAT'S YET ANOTHER SYMPTOM OF MR. DARMAN'S NATIONAL NOW NOW ISM
491c0319 THIS YEAR THE SOVIETS HAVE MOVED COMMERCIAL SALES TO THE FRONT BURNER
491c031a THE EXPORT ARM OF THE SOVIET MINISTRY OF AVIATION INDUSTRY HOPES TO DOUBLE ITS REVENUE BY THE MID NINETEEN NINETIES
491c031b BUT SUCH A SHIFT WOULD BRING MAJOR UPHEAVALS TO THE SOVIET SYSTEM
491c031c ORDERS FOR MILITARY AIRCRAFT HAVE FALLEN TWENTY PERCENT IN THE PAST TWO YEARS ACCORDING TO SOME ESTIMATES
491c031d AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN DECADES PRESTIGIOUS MILITARY DESIGN BUREAUS IN THE SOVIET UNION ARE DEVOTING SUBSTANTIAL MANPOWER TO CIVILIAN PROJECTS
491c031e ASHTON TATE HAS BEEN PLAGUED BY OPERATING LOSSES AND MANAGEMENT TURMOIL
491c031f LAST MONTH IT REPORTED A NINETEEN POINT EIGHT MILLION SECOND QUARTER NET LOSS AS WELL AS THE RESIGNATION OF ITS PRESIDENT AND CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER
491c031g ONCE A SOFTWARE INDUSTRY STAR THE COMPANY HAS BEEN BUFFETED BY GROWING COMPETITION IN ITS CORE DATABASE BUSINESS
491c0401 LAST WEEK THERE WERE REPORTS THAT AFTER THE OFFERING SHEARSON LEHMAN HAD A BIG UNSOLD CHUNK OF STOCK
491c0402 IN A NARROWLY DRAWN STATEMENT VICE CHAIRMAN HERBERT FREIMAN DENIED SHEARSON HAD OFFERED A BLOCK TO SALOMON BROTHERS WHICH MANAGED THE SELLING BROKERS' FLOOR OPERATION
491c0403 MR. FREIMAN WOULDN'T ELABORATE
491c0404 THAT MAY BE BUT THERE ARE TOUGH CALLS
491c0405 EMOTIONAL UPSET HEADACHES BACKACHES AND OTHER SUBJECTIVE SYMPTOMS ARE HARD TO QUANTIFY
491c0406 BESIDES SOMEONE WHO TRULY FEELS DISABLED MAY AS A RESULT ACTUALLY BE DISABLED
491c0407 A WELL TIMED PERIOD OF TIME OFF WITH STRESS REDUCTION AND AN EFFORT AT BETTER UNDERSTANDING MAY PREVENT A MUCH WORSE DISABILITY LATER
491c0408 <NOISE> IT MAY ALSO UNCOVER FACTORS AT THE WORKPLACE THAT CAN BE IMPROVED
491c0409 I TRY TO GIVE THE PATIENT THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT WITHIN REASON
491c040a NOT DOING SO IS MORE THAN UNKIND IT RISKS HARM TO THE PATIENT AND LAWSUITS THAT NEITHER THE PHYSICIAN NOR EMPLOYER WOULD WELCOME
491c040b BUT SOME FIND ELECTRONIC INVESTING ISN'T WORTH THE TROUBLE
491c040c MR. JEFFERS ESTIMATES THAT A THIRD OF INVESTMENT SOFTWARE BUYERS EVENTUALLY JUNK THEIR PURCHASES BECAUSE THE TECHNOLOGY BAFFLES THEM
491c040d AND WHILE SOME INVESTORS SAY THAT COMPUTERS HAVE MADE THEM MONEY OTHERS HAVE SQUANDERED SMALL FORTUNES BECAUSE THEY RELIED TOO HEAVILY ON TECHNOLOGY
491c040e BANKERS SAY CHILE MEXICO AND THE PHILIPPINES HAVE ACCOUNTED FOR MOST OF THE ESTIMATED SIX BILLION OF DEBT EQUITY SWAPS TO DATE
491c040f SOME BANKERS HAVE ESTIMATED THAT THE TOTAL MAY RISE AS HIGH AS TEN BILLION DOLLARS THIS YEAR
491c040g SUCH SWAPS ONLY BEGAN ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO
491c040h THE UTILITY WILL BEGIN PAYING INTEREST IN CASH AFTER SEABROOK GOES INTO SERVICE MR. BAYLESS SAID
491c040i MR. HARRISON SAID THE COMPANY DOESN'T KNOW HOW LONG IT WILL TAKE TO LEAP THE POLITICAL HURDLES THAT ARE BLOCKING SEABROOK
491c040j BUT THE FINANCIAL RESTRUCTURING IS INTENDED TO KEEP THE COMPANY GOING WITHOUT ADDITIONAL BORROWING UNTIL NINETEEN NINETY OR NINETEEN NINETY ONE HE SAID
491c040k JUDGE BORK HOWEVER ASKED FOR NONE OF THIS
491c040l BORK DOESN'T WANT A POLITICAL CAMPAIGN MR. GARMENT CONCEDES
491c040m I TOLD HIM I WOULD DO THIS UNLESS HE VIOLENTLY OBJECTED
491c040n HE SAID YOU'RE A FREE AGENT GARMENT
491c040o DO WHAT YOU THINK IS APPROPRIATE
491c040p THE HUGE GAP TO A LARGE EXTENT IS A PRICE PHENOMENON
491c040q THE DOLLAR'S FALL HAS PUSHED UP THE PRICE OF IMPORTS CAUSING THE DEFICIT TO SWELL EVEN AS THE VOLUME OF NON OIL IMPORTS HAS RECEDED
491c040r BUT LONG BEFORE NOW THESE HIGHER PRICES WERE SUPPOSED TO LEAD TO IMPROVEMENT IN THE MONTHLY MERCHANDISE TRADE DEFICIT AS WELL
491c040s OCTOBER THIRTY FIRST WASTE MANAGEMENT'S BOARD MEETS
491c040t CHEMLAWN IS DISCUSSED ONLY BRIEFLY AND IS RULED OUT AS A TAKEOVER TARGET BY MR. BUNTROCK

491c040v <NOISE> I DON'T KNOW IF JESSE JACKSON EVER DREAMED OF BEING PRESIDENT WHILE GROWING UP POOR AND BLACK IN SOUTH CAROLINA
491c040w I DO KNOW HE NEVER DREAMED IT WOULD BE EASY OR QUICK
491c040x I HOPE MR. JACKSON WILL FORGIVE ME IF I ASSUME THAT HE IS WILLING TO WAIT ANOTHER EIGHT WHILE KEEPING HIS EYES ON THE PRIZE
491c040y SOUTHWESTERN BELL HAS THIRTY DAYS TO CONTEST THE COMPLAINT
491c040z THE COMMISSION IS EXPECTED TO ISSUE A FINAL DECISION BY THE END OF THE YEAR

491c0411 WE HAVE FREEDOM IN THIS COUNTRY BUT IT STINKS SAYS ELEVEN YEAR OLD SEAN HOOKS
491c0412 DRUGS ALCOHOL CRIME
491c0413 THERE'S NO GOOD NEWS ANYMORE
491c0414 I'M HOPING WE GET A PRESIDENT WHO CLEANS OUT AMERICA
491c0415 DANIEL J. GILMARTIN WAS NAMED PRESIDENT AND CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER OF FRANK'S NURSERY AND CRAFTS DETROIT A UNIT OF THIS SPECIALTY RETAILER
491c0416 THE POSTS HAD BEEN VACANT SINCE EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
491c0417 MR. GILMARTIN HAD BEEN DIRECTOR OF CORPORATE PLANNING FOR THE PARENT COMPANY
491c0418 THEN IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR NATIONAL UNION JOINED THE MARKET
491c0419 ITS POLICY FOR STATE JUDGES THE BIGGEST CLIENTS COSTS EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR FOR A ONE MILLION POLICY WITH NO DEDUCTIBLE
491c041a THE JUDGES ARE COVERED FOR ACTS ERRORS OR OMISSIONS IN THE PERFORMANCE OF PROFESSIONAL DUTIES MR. BOLEN SAYS
492c0201 MORE TRADITIONAL ACADEMICS SAY MANY OF THE NEWER JOURNALS ARE MERELY PLATFORMS FOR MARGINAL SCHOLARS TO WRITE ON TRIVIAL TOPICS
492c0202 I'M DIMLY AWARE THAT THEY'RE OUT THERE SAYS RICHARD ULLMAN PROFESSOR OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS AT PRINCETON UNIVERSITY AND FORMER EDITOR OF FOREIGN POLICY MAGAZINE
492c0203 BUT I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT PEOPLE WHO PUBLISH SOMETHING THAT'S IMPORTANT WOULDN'T WANT TO PUBLISH IN THE LEADING JOURNALS
492c0204 THE UTILITY WILL BEGIN PAYING INTEREST IN CASH AFTER SEABROOK GOES INTO SERVICE MR. BAYLESS SAID
492c0205 MR. HARRISON SAID THE COMPANY DOESN'T KNOW HOW LONG IT WILL TAKE TO LEAP THE POLITICAL HURDLES THAT ARE BLOCKING SEABROOK
492c0206 BUT THE FINANCIAL RESTRUCTURING IS INTENDED TO KEEP THE COMPANY GOING WITHOUT ADDITIONAL BORROWING UNTIL NINETEEN NINETY OR NINETEEN NINETY ONE HE SAID
492c0207 ANALYSTS ALSO SAID THEY HADN'T EXPECTED LOWER OPERATING PROFITS FOR THE COMPANY'S INDUSTRIES GROUP AND FOR THE BROADCASTING SEGMENT
492c0208 WESTINGHOUSE OFFICIALS TOLD ANALYSTS THAT OPERATING PROFIT IN THE INDUSTRIES GROUP FELL FIFTEEN PERCENT TO TWENTY PERCENT HURT IN PART BY WEAK RESULTS IN CANADIAN OPERATIONS
492c0209 A SHARP DROP IN OPERATING PROFIT FROM THE BROADCASTING GROUP'S PRODUCTION COMPANY CONTRIBUTED TO THE SLIGHTLY LOWER OPERATING EARNINGS OVERALL FOR THAT SEGMENT
492c020a <NOISE> KEMP'S CAMPAIGN TAKES ON AN INCREASINGLY DESPERATE TONE
492c020b IN ONE SURE SIGN OF A CANDIDACY IN TROUBLE HE LASHES OUT AT CRITICISM FROM A LIGHTLY REGARDED T. V. COMMENTATOR
492c020c EVEN SOME SUPPORTERS NOW SAY PRIVATELY THAT HE SHOULD AIM FOR THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION
492c020d BUT HIS LONGTIME HOSTILITIES WITH DOLE LEAVE A SPOT ON A BUSH TICKET AS ABOUT THE ONLY POSSIBILITY
492c020e THOSE LANDS HAVE BECOME WORTH MUCH MORE THAN THE TRANSPORTATION AND ENERGY CONCERN NEEDS FOR THE RAILROAD AND THE COMPANY HAD BEEN TRYING TO FREE ITSELF FROM THE L- LIENS
492c020f LAST SPRING BURLINGTON AGREED TO PAY REMAINING BONDHOLDERS A TOTAL OF THIRTY FIVE POINT FIVE MILLION IN RETURN FOR PERMISSION TO REMOVE THE COVENANTS
492c020g A JUDGE APPROVED THE AGREEMENT IN NOVEMBER AND IT BECAME FINAL JANUARY TWELFTH
492c020h AFTER DEDUCTING NONRECURRING ITEMS THE U. S. X. STEEL UNIT NONETHELESS APPEARED TO TURN IN ONE OF ITS MOST PROFITABLE QUARTERS SINCE THE NINETEEN SIXTIES
492c020i ON A PER TON BASIS PRETAX PROFIT DOUBLED TO ABOUT THIRTY SIX DOLLARS FROM EIGHTEEN DOLLARS IN THE THIRD QUARTER
492c020j HOWEVER THE PERFORMANCE FELL FAR SHORT OF U. S. X. CHAIRMAN DAVID RODERICK'S PREDICTION OF FIFTY DOLLAR PLUS PER TON PROFIT
492c020k TEXAS OF COURSE IS WHERE THE MOST TROUBLE IS TO BE FOUND
492c020l LENDERS THERE LIKE TO BLAME THE SO CALLED OIL PATCH RECESSION
492c020m BUT THE PROBLEM IN FACT IS BAD BANKING IN A FEW CASES EVEN CORRUPT BANKING
492c020n SOME PARTS OF TEXAS THE DALLAS FORT
492c020o WORTH AREA FOR EXAMPLE HAVEN'T HAD ANYTHING THAT LEGITIMATELY COULD BE CALLED A RECESSION
492c020p THE MAIN REASON SO MANY LENDERS ARE IN TROUBLE IS AN OLD FASHIONED FAILING AMONG BANKERS A WEAKNESS FOR REAL ESTATE SPECULATION
492c020q AS A RESULT THE GOVERNMENT IS TALKING OF HIGHER FARM PRICES
492c020r BUT HIGHER FARM PRICES WOULD ADD TO AN ALREADY STEEP INFLATION RATE
492c020s SO BEIJING OFFICIALS REPORTEDLY TALK OF TYING WAGES TO INFLATION AN IDEA REMINISCENT OF THE WAGE INDEXATION TRIED IN SOME LATIN AMERICAN NATIONS SEVERAL YEARS AGO WITH DISASTROUS RESULTS
492c020t SECRETARIES ARE ALSO EASY TARGETS FOR A HUG ESPECIALLY IN HOLLYWOOD
492c020u I'VE SEEN A WRITER WALK INTO AN OFFICE AND PULL A SECRETARY UP AGAINST HIM
492c020v SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO SAYS CHARLES FRIES CHAIRMAN OF FRIES ENTERTAINMENT INCORPORATED
492c020w NOT TO WORRY SAYS H. FLINT RANNEY A LOCAL REAL ESTATE AGENT
492c020x WE HAVE A GREAT SENSE OF HUMOR HE SAYS
492c020y WE'LL TAKE ALMOST ANYTHING
492c020z BESIDES HE ADDS NEW YORKERS COME HERE ALL THE TIME WE JUST WOULDN'T WANT THEM TO LIVE HERE
492c0210 ONE BIG PLAY LAST YEAR WAS LEISURE
492c0211 ANOTHER WAS UNDERVALUED ASSETS EVEN THOUGH NO ONE CAN RECALL A JAPANESE COMPANY BEING BROKEN UP FOR ITS ASSETS
492c0212 ONCE YOU GET THAT THEME THE LEVEL OF THE P. /SLASH E. RATIO DOESN'T MEAN A DAMN SAYS MR. ROBINS
492c0213 IT'S ALL A BIT OF A MIRAGE
492c0214 YET ONE THAT SO FAR HAS WORKED
492c0215 BUT OTHER EVIDENCE ON THE FLAPS IS CONFLICTING
492c0216 ONE OF THE CREW MEMBERS CAN BE HEARD ON THE COCKPIT VOICE RECORDING CALLING OUT FLAPS FIFTEEN FIFTEEN THE CORRECT POSITION FOR THE FLAPS
492c0217 AND THE RECORDER INDICATES THAT A COCKPIT ALARM THAT SHOULD HAVE ALERTED THE CREW TO IMPROPERLY SET FLAPS DIDN'T GO OFF
492c0218 WHAT BOTHERS THESE PEOPLE IS NOT THAT MRS. THATCHER POSES A DANGER TO THE SO CALLED UNIFIED EUROPEAN MARKET
492c0219 MRS. THATCHER IS NOT OPPOSED TO THIS
492c021a BRITAIN'S OWN MARKETS ARE MORE OPEN THAN THOSE OF MOST EUROPEAN COUNTRIES LONDON IS WAY AHEAD OF THEM ON CAPITAL MOVEMENT HAVING ABOLISHED EXCHANGE CONTROLS ALTOGETHER
492c021b THE CAUSE OF THE OUTRAGE IS THAT EUROPEAN UNITY IS THE DEVICE THROUGH WHICH THE REGULATORS AND SOCIALISTS HOPE TO EXPAND THEIR GRIP ON THE CONTINENT
492c021c NOW HIS LAUGHTER IS GONE
492c021d BECAUSE OF DRUGS HE IS DEAD
492c021e AND EVERY DAY MY HEART BREAKS A LITTLE MORE
492c021f ON THE SURFACE THE TRADE REPORT LOOKED ENCOURAGING
492c021g THE NATION'S SEASONALLY ADJUSTED TRADE DEFICIT NARROWED TO EIGHT POINT SEVENTEEN BILLION IN JUNE THE LOWEST MONTHLY DEFICIT SINCE DECEMBER NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR
492c021h WHAT'S MORE THE MAY TRADE DEFICIT WAS REVISED DOWN TO TEN POINT OH TWO BILLION FROM THE TEN POINT TWENTY FOUR BILLION ORIGINALLY REPORTED
492c0301 SO FAR ILLEGAL FOREIGN WORKERS AREN'T TAKEN AS A JOB THREAT BY JAPANESE WORKERS
492c0302 BUT JAPANESE UNEMPLOYMENT IS AT HISTORICALLY HIGH LEVELS BECAUSE OF THE YEN'S STRENGTH POSING A KNOTTY PROBLEM FOR THE GOVERNMENT
492c0303 MANY JAPANESE COMPANIES IN SUCH INDUSTRIES AS STEEL AND SHIPBUILDING ARE CUTTING THEIR LABOR FORCES
492c0304 IN THE PAST FILIPINOS IN MANY RURAL AREAS PREFERRED THE DISCIPLINED TERROR OF THE N. P. A. TO THE RANDOM EXCESSES OF THE COUNTRY'S MILITARY
492c0305 WITH THE CHANGE OF GOVERNMENT LAST YEAR A MILD IMPROVEMENT IN MILITARY BEHAVIOR AND THE DETECTION OF THE MINDANAO SLAUGHTERS SOME FILIPINOS ARE CHANGING THEIR MINDS
492c0306 DIPLOMATS AND POLITICAL ANALYSTS SAY THEY DON'T KNOW IF THE TREND PRESAGES SIGNIFICANT POPULAR RESISTANCE TO THE COMMUNISTS OR JUST ADDITIONAL TURMOIL IN THE PHILIPPINE COUNTRYSIDE
492c0307 THERE IS A WIDE VARIATION IN THINKING ABOUT HOW SICK ONE IS AND HOW IMPORTANT TIME OFF IS IN ORDER TO GET WELL
492c0308 THE PATIENTS' RESPONSIBILITIES OUTSIDE OF WORK ALSO VARY
492c0309 IT'S HARD TO SAY TO WHAT DEGREE THESE FACTORS SHOULD INFLUENCE DISABILITY STATUS
492c030a MOST PHYSICIANS PROBABLY CONSIDER THEM IMPORTANT
492c030b IN CLEVELAND HIGBEE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER ROBERT BROADBENT SAYS THE RETAILER HAS BENEFITED FROM ITS PARENT'S FINANCIAL EXPERTISE
492c030c ALTHOUGH IT WILL RETAIN CONTROL INDUSTRIAL EQUITY IS PLANNING TO TAKE HIGBEE PUBLIC AGAIN PROBABLY IN JUNE
492c030d MEANWHILE SAYS MR. BROADBENT THEY'VE MADE US MORE INQUISITIVE ABOUT ACQUISITIONS OURSELVES
492c030e THE LOAN IS PART OF A SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR PLAN TO EXPAND THE MINE'S RESERVES AND ALLOW IT TO KEEP OPERATING UNTIL NINETEEN NINETY FOUR
492c030f WITHOUT THE EXPANSION THE MINE WAS THREATENED WITH CLOSURE NEXT YEAR
492c030g CLOSURE WOULD MEAN THE LOSS OF SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN JOBS
492c030h ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS ARE CONCERNED BY INTELLIGENCE REPORTS THAT SUGGEST IRAN IS THINKING ABOUT ORGANIZING TERRORIST STRIKES AGAINST AMERICAN WEST EUROPEAN AND ARAB TARGETS
492c030i THE ADMINISTRATION HAS ALERTED EMBASSIES AND MILITARY BASES OF AN INCREASED THREAT
492c030j ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS SAY INTELLIGENCE ALSO SHOWS THAT IRAN HAS LAID THE GROUNDWORK FOR TERRORISM IN THE UNITED STATES
492c030k WITHIN AN HOUR BARCLAYS P. L. C. LLOYDS BANK P. L. C. AND THE LONDON UNIT OF CITICORP INCREASED THEIR BASE RATES
492c030l THE BARCLAYS BOOST TOOK EFFECT IMMEDIATELY WHILE THE OTHER TWO BANKS' MOVES WERE EFFECTIVE AT THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS
492c030m SIMILAR INCREASES BY NATIONAL WESTMINSTER BANK P. L. C. AND MIDLAND BANK P. L. C. GO INTO EFFECT TODAY
492c030n BASE RATES ARE THE BENCHMARK FOR COMMERCIAL LENDING IN BRITAIN
492c030o THE FOLLOWING OFFICERS DIRECTORS AND LARGE STOCKHOLDERS OF COMPANIES REPORTED CHANGES IN HOLDINGS UNDE(R)- UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF NINETEEN THIRTY FOUR
492c030p THOSE IDENTIFIED AS BENEFICIAL OWNERS HOLD AT LEAST TEN PERCENT OF A COMPANY'S EQUITY SECURITIES
492c030q UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED CHANGES INVOLVED DIRECT HOLDINGS OF COMMON STOCK AND TOOK PLACE IN MAY NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT
492c030r COMPANIES ARE LISTED WHERE TRANSACTIONS GENERALLY AGGREGATE TEN THOUSAND SHARES OR A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS
492c030s ANOTHER CONDITION IS THAT TOPEKA GROUP A UNIT OF DULUTH MINNESOTA BASED MINNESOTA POWER AND LIGHT COMPANY EXERCISE ITS OPTION TO BUY DELTONA'S UTILITY SUBSIDIARIES
492c030t BASED ON CURRENT BOOK VALUE THE SUBSIDIARIES WOULD FETCH THIRTY TWO POINT FIVE MILLION IN CASH PLUS PREFERRED STOCK IN ONE OF THE UTILITY UNITS
492c030u TOPEKA SAID IT INTENDS TO EXERCISE THE OPTION
492c030v THE BIGGEST HURDLE WAS TO FIND THE FUNDS TO MEET THE COST OF RECONSTRUCTION INCLUSIVE OF THE ISSUE OF STAMPS
492c030w HOWEVER THE RESPONSE TO THE GOVERNMENT'S INTERNATIONAL APPEAL FOR ASSISTANCE HAS BEEN EXTREMELY HEARTWARMING
492c030x THE FUNDS REQUIRED FOR PUBLIC SECTOR ASSISTANCE HAVE BEEN REALIZED AND THE FURTHER AMOUNT REQUIRED IS EXPECTED TO FLOW FROM THE PROCEEDS OF THE OVERSEAS REINSURANCE OF PROPERTY DAMAGE
492c030y TO BEGIN WITH COMPANIES HAVE BEEN DOING A GOOD JOB OF MANAGING INVENTORIES
492c030z IN THE PAST BUSINESSES HAVE TENDED TO BECOME INCREASINGLY OPTIMISTIC AS EXPANSIONS PERSISTED
492c0310 WHEN SALES EVENTUALLY SLOWED INVENTORIES QUICKLY REACHED EXCESSIVE LEVELS
492c0311 COMPANIES THEREUPON CUT THEIR BUYING INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION DECLINED AND A RECESSION WAS UNDER WAY
492c0312 THIRTY ONE TEAMS OF NINETEEN REPRESENTING BUSINESSES SCHOOLS AND ASSORTED OTHER GROUPS SIGNED UP FOR THE FIRST LOCAL COMPETITION
492c0313 FOR WEEKS DRUMS WERE HEARD ALONG THE WILLAMETTE AS THE TEAMS PRACTICED
492c0314 BOATS FULL OF MEN AND WOMEN IN BUSINESS SUITS FRESH FROM WORK OR HAPPY HOUR WERE NOT AN UNCOMMON SIGHT
492c0315 THESE MIXED FEELINGS OF FRUSTRATION WITH AND GRATITUDE TOWARD THE AUTHORITIES ARE PART OF THE EVERYDAY LIFE OF A FOREIGNER DOING BUSINESS IN KOREA
492c0316 IN FACT SUCH CONTRADICTIONS ARE WHAT SEEM TO MAKE THE KOREAN WORLD GO ROUND
492c0317 A WESTERN BUSINESSMAN NEEDS TO BE READY FOR THEM
492c0318 HERE ARE A FEW HARD LEARNED FACTS OF KOREAN BUSINESS LIFE
492c0319 BUT MANY LOCAL BUSINESSES THAT DEPEND ON TOURISM AREN'T CONVINCED
492c031a THEY ARGUE THAT A COMMERCIAL MINE MIGHT GET PLAYED OUT IN A FEW YEARS
492c031b AND THEY FEAR THAT MANY TOURISTS WHO TREK HERE FOR THE TANTALIZING PROSPECT OF FINDING A DIAMOND IN THE FIELD WILL TAKE THEIR VACATIONS ELSEWHERE
492c0401 THE COURT WAS SPLIT ON BOTH THE WILLIAMS ACT AND COMMERCE CLAUSE
492c0402 JUSTICE LEWIS POWELL ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO CASE OF EDWARD VERSUS
492c0403 MITE SUGGESTED THAT ANY STATE LAW THAT FAVORED TARGETS MORE THAN DID THE WILLIAMS ACT WOULD BE INVALID BECAUSE CONGRESS HAD PREEMPTED LOCAL REGULATIONS
492c0404 THE COURT BACKTRACKED HERE TO SAY STATE LAWS MIGHT BE O. K. IF THEY HELP THE WILLIAMS ACT'S PURPOSE BY HEAPING EVEN MORE BURDENS ON ACQUIRERS
492c0405 IT HAS RELIEVED AT LEAST SOME OF THE FRUSTRATION FELT BY THE FARMERS SAYS PETER BRENT A MEMBER OF A FARM ACTIVIST GROUP
492c0406 IF THEY GO TO MEDIATION AT LEAST THE LENDER HAS TO LISTEN
492c0407 NEARLY A DOZEN OTHER STATES HAVE INQUIRED INTO IOWA'S PROGRAM
492c0408 AND MANDATORY MEDIATION MODELED ON IOWA'S PROGRAM IS CURRENTLY BEING CONSIDERED BY THE CALIFORNIA AND MISSOURI LEGISLATURES
492c0409 OGILVY IS THE NATION'S FIFTH LARGEST ADVERTISING AGENCY WITH NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX BILLINGS OF THREE POINT TWO BILLION
492c040a ROUGHLY HALF OF THOSE BILLINGS COME FROM OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES MR. ROMAN SAID
492c040b AGENCIES TRADITIONALLY HAVE TAKEN FIFTEEN PERCENT OF BILLINGS AS A COMMISSION
492c040c L. T. V. HAS SAID REPEATEDLY SINCE ITS FILING THAT IT WOULD FIGHT ANY CREDITOR MOVE TO EITHER REORGANIZE THE UNIT SEPARATELY OR FORCE ITS SALE
492c040d CREDITORS ON THE OTHER HAND HAVE DISCUSSED THE IDEA ALMOST SINCE THE DAY OF L. T. V.'S FILING
492c040e AND THE PENSION AGENCY THE BANKS AND THE COMMITTEE REPRESENTING UNSECURED CREDITORS HAVE RECENTLY BEEN HOLDING SERIOUS DISCUSSIONS ON THE ISSUE
492c040f IN REACTION TO THE NEWS INTEREST RATES PLUNGED THE AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR FIRMED AND ANALYSTS PREDICTED STOCKS WOULD MOVE HIGHER
492c040g BUT WHILE THE BUDGET GAVE A BOOST TO THE MARKETS IT ALSO PRESAGED GREATER AUSTERITY FOR THE NATION AS A WHOLE
492c040h TO MR. HAWKE THAT IS AS IT SHOULD BE
492c040i AUSTRALIANS HAVE GOT TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE AREN'T OUT OF THE WOODS YET HE SAYS
492c040j WE'VE GOT ENORMOUS PROBLEMS AND WE HAVE TO LEARN TO LIVE WITHIN OUR RESOURCES
492c040k DESPITE ALL THE UNCERTAINTY THAT SURROUNDED BRITISH PETROLEUM'S JUMBO OFFERING THERE WASN'T THAT MUCH TURMOIL IN THE MARKET WHEN SHARES BEGAN TO TRADE FRIDAY
492c040l B. P.'S PARTIALLY PAID AMERICAN DEPOSITARY SHARES CLOSED UNCHANGED AT SEVENTEEN AND A FOURTH WITH THIRTEEN POINT TWO MILLION TRADED
492c040m IT WAS THE BIG BOARD'S MOST ACTIVE ISSUE
492c040n THE ROLLBACKS COULD BE UNEXPECTEDLY PAINFUL FOR SOME HOURLY WORKERS
492c040o CHRYSLER'S UNEMPLOYMENT FUND HAS BEEN DRAINED TO THE POINT THAT BENEFITS ARE ALREADY BEING REDUCED A U. A. V. SPOKESMAN SAID
492c040p THE FUND HAS AT LEAST IN PART BEEN DRAINED BY WORKERS TEMPORARILY LAID OFF WHEN PLANTS WERE CLOSED DOWN FOR RETOOLING
492c040q HERE ARE PRICE TRENDS ON THE WORLD'S MAJOR STOCK MARKETS AS CALCULATED BY MORGAN STANLEY CAPITAL INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE GENEVA
492c040r TO MAKE THEM DIRECTLY COMPARABLE EACH INDEX IS BASED ON THE CLOSE OF NINETEEN SIXTY NINE EQUALING ONE HUNDRED
492c040s THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE IS SINCE YEAR END
492c040t WE WANT MORE INSTITUTIONAL ASSETS SAYS A KEMPER SPOKESWOMAN
492c040u WE THINK THE BUSINESS HOLDS CONSIDERABLE PROMISE FOR THE FUTURE SHE ADDS AND WE THINK CITICORP IS A CAPABLE ORGANIZATION
492c040v OTHERS SAY INSTITUTIONAL ASSET MANAGEMENT STILL IS CONSIDERED A GOOD BUSINESS DESPITE RELATIVELY LOW FEES AND SIGNS OF SLOWING GROWTH
492c040w FIRST BOSTON AND XEROX HAD NO COMMENT
492c040x THE CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER WOULD HAVE BOTH THE FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL BUSINESSES REPORTING TO HIM
492c040y MR. SHELTON HAD LED AN IMPROVED PERFORMANCE OF THE LATTER DURING THE PAST TWO YEARS
492c040z HE ALSO HAS A LONGER TERM RELATIONSHIP WITH COMPANY CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER WILLIAM S. WIRE THE SECOND WORKING FOR GENESCO SINCE NINETEEN FIFTY SIX
492c0410 FARM FUTURES PRICES HAVE FALLEN SEVERAL TIMES IN THE PAST TWO WEEKS FOLLOWING SEVERAL WEEKS OF A DROUGHT INSPIRED RALLY
492c0411 YESTERDAY'S TRADING SEEMED TO SUPPORT THE NOTION AMONG SOME ANALYSTS THAT CORN AND WHEAT FUTURES ARE TOP HEAVY
492c0412 THE MARKET HAS BEEN OVERDONE SIGNIFICANTLY ON THE UPSIDE SAID RICHARD LOEWY SENIOR GRAIN AND OIL SEED ANALYST WITH PRUDENTIAL BACHE SECURITIES INCORPORATED
492c0413 THE PIPER HAS TO BE PAID ON THE OTHER SIDE
492c0414 ONE OF THE FOUR BUSINESSES INCLUDED IN THE LOCKUP OPTION GRANTED TO K. K. R. IS MACMILLAN'S DIRECTORY DIVISION WHICH CONSISTS OF WHO'S WHO AND NATIONAL REGISTER PUBLISHING
492c0415 THUS IT WASN'T IMMEDIATELY CLEAR WHY INTERNATIONAL THOMSON MIGHT BE LOOKING AT THE OPERATION EVEN THOUGH IT IS INCLUDED IN THE LOCKUP OPTION
492c0416 A SPOKESMAN FOR K. K. R. ALSO DECLINED COMMENT
492c0417 THE DECISION FREES INTERIOR OFFICIALS TO FORMALLY OPEN OIL COMPANY BIDS TO LEASE UP TO FIVE POINT SIX MILLION ACRES IN A SALMON RICH AREA NEAR THE BERING SEA
492c0418 THE GOVERNMENT SOLICITED BIDS FOR THE SALE IN JANUARY NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX BUT UNTIL NOW HAS BEEN BARRED BY COURT ORDER FROM OPENING THEM
492c0419 OFFICIALS SAID THE BIDS WOULD BE OPENED IN ANCHORAGE ALASKA TUESDAY
492c041a TO BE SURE ON A LOT OF SCORES THE SUMMIT WAS A SUCCESS
492c041b ECONOMIC COOPERATION WAS ADVANCED WITH BUSINESSMEN SIGNING AGREEMENTS FOR ABOUT THIRTY CONTRACTS AND SEVERAL JOINT VENTURES
492c041c HUMAN RIGHTS TOO MAY HAVE TAKEN A STEP FORWARD IF MR. GORBACHEV LIVES UP TO HIS PROMISE TO RELEASE ALL POLITICAL PRISONERS BY YEAR'S END
492c041d IN EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT THE POLITICAL SETTLEMENT ENVISAGED BY THE NON COMMUNISTS SEEMED PLAUSIBLE
492c041e SOVIET LEADER MIKHAIL GORBACHEV WAS A MAJOR REASON
492c041f MR. GORBACHEV SAW THE EXPANSIONIST AMBITIONS OF HIS PREDECESSORS *STYMIED* BY THE RESOLUTE CONTAINMENT POLICY OF BOTH CHINA AND THE PRO WESTERN A. S. E. A. N. POWERS
492c041g SUPPORT FOR THE VIETNAMESE OCCUPATION OF CAMBODIA COST THE SOVIET UNION ECONOMICALLY AND DIPLOMATICALLY
492c041h SO THE SOVIETS TRYING TO ELIMINATE THE MILITARY QUAGMIRE IN CAMBODIA PERSUADED HANOI'S LEADERS TO NEGOTIATE A MILITARY WITHDRAWAL FROM CAMBODIA
493c0201 LAST WEEK THERE WERE REPORTS THAT AFTER THE OFFERING SHEARSON LEHMAN HAD A BIG UNSOLD CHUNK OF STOCK
493c0202 IN A NARROWLY DRAWN STATEMENT VICE CHAIRMAN HERBERT FREIMAN DENIED SHEARSON HAD OFFERED A BLOCK TO SALOMON BROTHERS WHICH MANAGED THE SELLING BROKERS' FLOOR OPERATION
493c0203 MR. FREIMAN WOULDN'T ELABORATE
493c0204 THE SWISS FRANC BOND MARKET MEANWHILE REMAINED LISTLESS DESPITE A SHARP FALL IN THE DOLLAR
493c0205 MOST PRICES WERE UNCHANGED WITH AVERAGE TURNOVER TRADERS SAID
493c0206 ONE GENEVA TRADER SAID INVESTORS WERE STAYING OUT OF THE MARKET BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE THE BOTTOM IS IN THE DOLLAR'S CURRENT DECLINE
493c0207 CLOSELY HELD TRANSAMERICAN SAID IT ALSO AGREED TO SETTLE A DISPUTE WITH ANOTHER CREDITOR MEDALLION OIL COMPANY
493c0208 THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENTS WHICH MUST BE APPROVED BY THE BANKRUPTCY COURT WOULD REMOVE TWO MAJOR HURDLES IN TRANSAMERICAN'S LONG STRUGGLE TO GET OUT OF CHAPTER ELEVEN PROCEEDINGS
493c0209 TRANSAMERICAN FILED FOR COURT PROTECTION FROM CREDITORS IN JANUARY NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE WHEN IT WAS MIRED IN ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS OF DEBT
493c020a I RECEIVED WELFARE FOR EIGHT MONTHS AFTER MY SECOND CHILD WAS BORN
493c020b LUCKILY I WAS ABLE WITH THE HELP OF MY FAMILY TO GET A GOOD JOB AND RELIABLE CHILD CARE
493c020c BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF WELFARE MOTHERS OUT THERE WHO AREN'T THIS FORTUNATE
493c020d A LOT OF WOMEN DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET JOBS OR THE TRAINING NEEDED TO GET ONE AND SOMEONE TO WATCH THEIR CHILDREN
493c020e WHEN THAT SITUATION IS RESOLVED THEN YOU WILL SEE A LOT OF FORMER WELFARE RECIPIENTS BECOMING PRODUCTIVE MEMBERS OF SOCIETY
493c020f THE SUN BELT FORECAST PARTLY CLOUDY
493c020g ECONOMISTS EXPECT THE SOUTHEAST BUFFERED BY ITS BIG SERVICE ECONOMY TO CONTINUE TO OUTPERFORM THE NATION
493c020h BUT SOME OVERBUILT REAL ESTATE MARKETS COULD GET BASHED AND FLORIDA'S INFLUX OF RETIREES JOB SEEKERS AND TOURISTS COULD DWINDLE
493c020i <NOISE> THE SHAREHOLDER DAVID F. LAROCHE A PROVIDENCE RHODE ISLAND INVESTOR FILED THE SUIT IN A STATE SUPERIOR COURT IN NEWPORT
493c020j THE SUIT REQUESTS THE COURT TO ISSUE ORDERS PROHIBITING THE PROPOSED ACQUISITION AND REQUIRING NECO TO HOLD ITS ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS TO ELECT FOUR DIRECTORS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
493c020k A SUPERIOR COURT JUDGE DECLINED TO ISSUE A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER REQUESTED BY THE SUIT TO BLOCK THE ACQUISITION SAID A COURT CLERK
493c020l IN ADDITION LAURENTIAN SAID BERNHARD M. KOCH THIRTY THREE WAS NAMED VICE PRESIDENT AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER
493c020m HE SUCCEEDS JOHN STROM WHO TRANSFERRED TO A LAURENTIAN CAPITAL UNIT
493c020n PREVIOUSLY MR. KOCH WAS DIRECTOR OF INTERNAL AUDIT AT LAURENTIAN GROUP CORPORATION AND IMPERIAL LIFE ASSURANCE COMPANY OF CANADA MAJORITY SHAREHOLDERS OF LAURENTIAN CAPITAL
493c020o EL SALVADOR'S DUARTE TRAVELED TO THE U. S. FOR TREATMENT OF WHAT HE DESCRIBED AS A MALIGNANT STOMACH DISEASE

493c020q A SPOKESMAN SAID TESTS WOULD BE CONDUCTED AT WALTER REED ARMY MEDICAL CENTER IN WASHINGTON
493c020r HOW SERIOUS AND PATIENT INVESTOR INTEREST IS WILL BE TESTED NEXT MONTH
493c020s A GOVERNMENT OWNED INSURANCE AGENCY IS SET TO AUCTION OFF THE HYATT REGENCY MANILA
493c020t THE AGENCY HOPES TO REALIZE ITS TARGET PRICE OF THIRTEEN MILLION DOLLARS
493c020u THUS INSTEAD OF CALMAT'S BEING ACQUIRED SELECT ASSETS WOULD BE OPTIONED AND A HUNK OF STOCK WOULD BE IN RELATIVELY SAFE HANDS
493c020v CALMAT WOULD BE RID OF MR. BRIERLEY WHO APPEARS TO HAVE TRIED TO PUT THE COMPANY IN PLAY
493c020w INDUSTRIAL EQUITY EXECUTIVES IN CALIFORNIA DIDN'T RETURN CALLS SEEKING COMMENT <NOISE>
493c020x MR. CHATICHAI'S WEALTHY FAMILY BACKGROUND AND HIS FAMILY'S LARGE PROPERTY INTERESTS GIVE HIM A GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY
493c020y FURTHER HE HAS GOOD RELATIONS WITH THE LARGE ETHNIC CHINESE COMMUNITY AND SERVES AS CHAIRMAN OF THE THAI CHINESE FRIENDSHIP ASSOCIATION
493c020z THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE COUNTRY'S BUSINESS ELITE MANY OF WHOM ARE ETHNIC CHINESE
493c0210 HOWEVER CONVENTIONAL FILM WILL BE MARGINALLY PROFITABLE AT BEST FOR POLAROID BECAUSE INITIALLY POLAROID WON'T BE MANUFACTURING THE FILM CONTENDS ELLIOTT NOVAK AN INDUSTRY CONSULTANT
493c0211 INSTEAD IT WILL BUY THE FILM FROM ANOTHER COMPANY AND PUT ITS NAME ON IT JUST AS IT DOES WITH VIDEOTAPE
493c0212 SINCE IT BEGAN SELLING VIDEOTAPE A FEW YEARS AGO POLAROID HAS BUILT UP AN IMPRESSIVE TWELVE PERCENT MARKET SHARE MAKING IT THE LEADER IN THE U. S.
493c0213 BUT FIERCE COMPETITION HAS KEPT VIDEOTAPE PROFITS SLIM AND THE CONVENTIONAL FILM BUSINESS ISN'T LIKELY TO PROVE ANY BONANZA EITHER
493c0214 PETER DAPUZZO HEAD OF RETAIL TRADING AT SHEARSON LEHMAN HUTTON ALSO LOOKS FOR A SHARP UPWARD MOVE IN STOCK PRICES GIVEN A FEW IFS
493c0215 ONE IS IF INVESTORS DON'T GET SPOOKED AT THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE CRASH
493c0216 ANOTHER IS IF THE FEDERAL RESERVE EASES INTEREST RATES
493c0217 AND A THIRD IS IF GEORGE BUSH WINS THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION
493c0218 I DON'T KNOW IF THE PARENTS UNDERSTAND HOW SUBTLE THIS NEW AGE MOVEMENT REALLY IS SHE SAYS
493c0219 THEY DRAW THE KIDS IN WITH FAIRY TALES AND SORCERY
493c021a THEIR ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO DO AWAY WITH ANYBODY WHO BELIEVES THERE'S SUCH A THING AS EVIL
493c021b BUT YAMAICHI DENIED THE RUMORS
493c021c THIS MAKES A DOZEN CALLS I'VE HAD ON THIS TODAY SAID AN ANNOYED TRADING OFFICIAL AT YAMAICHI'S NEW YORK BASED U. S. SUBSIDIARY
493c021d HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE FIRM ACTIVELY SOLD S. AND P. FIVE HUNDRED FUTURES LAST WEEK AND THAT DEAN WITTER HANDLED SOME OF THE SALES
493c021e BUT HE ADDED THAT WE HAVEN'T BEEN A HEAVY SELLER AT ALL THIS WEEK
493c0301 THE BROADCASTING PROPERTIES HAVE LONG BEEN REGARDED AS GENCORP'S BEST DEFENSE AGAINST A HOSTILE TAKEOVER
493c0302 LICENSES FOR TWO OF THE TELEVISION STATIONS AND ALL THE RADIO STATIONS ARE BEING CHALLENGED BY GROUPS WHO CHARGE THAT GENCORP IS AN UNFIT OPERATOR
493c0303 THE DISPUTE INCLUDES ALLEGATIONS THAT GENCORP FAILED TO ADEQUATELY INFORM THE F. C. C. OF ALLEGEDLY IMPROPER CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS AND FOREIGN PAYMENTS
493c0304 THE NEW TAX LAW'S LIMITS ON RETIREMENT BENEFITS FOR EXECUTIVES SPUR GREATER INTEREST IN CERTAIN TRUSTS THAT HELP SAFEGUARD DEFERRED COMPENSATION UNTIL RETIREMENT TIME
493c0305 SUCH TRUSTS AREN'T COMPLETELY INVIOLATE CREDITORS CAN CLAIM THE MONEY AFTER A BANKRUPTCY FOR INSTANCE
493c0306 BUT THEY ARE CONSIDERED BETTER THAN A MERE PROMISE TO THE EXECUTIVE
493c0307 J. W. T. HADN'T YET RESPONDED TO W. P. P.'S WEDNESDAY BID OF FORTY FIVE DOLLARS A SHARE OR ABOUT FOUR AND HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS
493c0308 ON FRIDAY W. P. P. LAUNCHED A HOSTILE FORTY FIVE DOLLAR A SHARE TENDER OFFER FOR J. W. T.'S APPROXIMATELY TEN MILLION T- SHARES OUTSTANDING
493c0309 THAT HOSTILE OFFER FORMALLY REMAINED IN EFFECT DESPITE W. P. P.'S LATEST MOVE
493c030a AT A MEETING WITH ANALYSTS ROBERT M. KAVNER A. T. AND T.'S CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER SAID IT APPEARS WE WILL HAVE A GOOD YEAR
493c030b BUT IN RESPONSE TO AN ANALYST'S QUESTION HE SAID EARNINGS OF TWO DOLLARS A SHARE SOUNDS STRONG
493c030c HE ALSO WARNED ANALYSTS AGAINST LOOKING AT A PARTICULAR QUARTER AND ISOLATING IT ADDING WE ARE LOOKING FOR THE ANNUAL TREND LINE
493c030d THERE'S SOME PAPER OUT FOR BIDS YOU HAVEN'T HEARD ABOUT CADWALLADER BECAUSE YOU DO ONLY DOMESTIC
493c030e COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT BONDS WITH THE COUPON INDEXED TO THE STREET PRICE OF COCAINE
493c030f SOLID INVESTMENT BUT INTRIGUING
493c030g I THINK WE'RE GOING TO SPRING FOR THAT
493c030h WITH A REBOUND IN THE STOCK MARKET INVESTORS' FEARS ABOUT A RECESSION COOLED AND THE BOND MARKET SLUMPED
493c030i A SLIDE IN THE U. S. DOLLAR ALSO ADDED SOME DOWNWARD PRESSURE TO BOND PRICES
493c030j DESPITE THE DECLINE IN BONDS THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM STILL CONTINUED TO MAKE GOOD ON ITS PROMISE TO PROVIDE AMPLE LIQUIDITY THROUGH ITS OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS
493c030k DESPITE I- ALL THE UNCERTAINTY THAT SURROUNDED BRITISH PETROLEUM'S JUMBO OFFERING THERE WASN'T THAT MUCH TURMOIL IN THE MARKET WHEN SHARES BEGAN TO TRADE FRIDAY
493c030l B. P.'S PARTIALLY PAID AMERICAN DEPOSITARY SHARES CLOSED UNCHANGED AT SEVENTEEN AND A QUARTER WITH THIRTEEN POINT TWO MILLION SHARES TRADED
493c030m IT WAS THE BIG BOARD'S MOST ACTIVE ISSUE
493c030n UNTIL NOW NASDAQ OR THE N. A. S. D.'S AUTOMATED QUOTATION SYSTEM HAS PROVIDED COMPUTER TERMINALS WITH PRICE QUOTATIONS ON ALL ISSUES
493c030o MOST BIG TRADES HOWEVER ARE NEGOTIATED BY TELEPHONE AND THEN RECORDED IN THE SYSTEM'S COMPUTERS
493c030p ONLY THE SMALL ORDER SYSTEM HAS PROVIDED TRADERS WITH THE ABILITY TO EXECUTE TRADES BY COMPUTER RATHER THAN BY TELEPHONE
493c030q STILL COMPANY INSIDERS SAID THE RESTRUCTURING WAS ENTIRELY MR. AKERS'S PLAN AND WASN'T FORCED ON HIM BY THE I. B. M. BOARD
493c030r A DIRECTOR SAID THE *BOARD* LEARNED OF THE PLAN AT ITS MEETING LAST TUESDAY
493c030s JOHN FOUND EVERYTHING WAS COMING ONTO HIS DESK AND HE HAD MORE THAN HE COULD COPE WITH ANOTHER DIRECTOR SAID
493c030t HE WANTED AN ORGANIZATION WHICH RESOLVED MORE PROBLEMS BEFORE THEY GOT TO HIM
493c030u THE E. P. A. PROPOSED MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR MUNICIPAL TRASH DUMPS THAT THE AGENCY ESTIMATED WILL COST EIGHT HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR
493c030v THE PROPOSED RULES WOULD A- REQUIRE ABOUT SIX THOUSAND DUMPS TO INSTALL GROUNDWATER MONITORING SYSTEMS
493c030w THEY WOULD ALSO CLOSE SOME DUMPS AND PUT SPECIAL CONDITIONS ON OTHERS IN CERTAIN AREAS
493c030x HOPING TO PREVENT LONG COSTLY DISPUTES OVER WHAT DOCUMENTS DEFENDANTS HAVE TO SURRENDER JUDGES GRANT BLANKET PROTECTIVE ORDERS
493c030y THE ORDERS TYPICALLY BAR PUBLIC DISSEMINATION OF RECORDS AND DEPOSITIONS EVEN AFTER A SETTLEMENT OR VERDICT
493c030z PLAINTIFFS' LAWYERS GENERALLY HAVEN'T BALKED AS LONG AS THEY CAN GET THE INFORMATION THEY NEED TO PREPARE FOR THEIR TRIALS
493c0310 RANDOM HOUSE A SUBSIDIARY OF NEWHOUSE FAMILY'S ADVANCE PUBLICATIONS INCORPORATED SAID THE MOVE WILL TAKE IT OUT OF THE TEXTBOOK PUBLISHING BUSINESS
493c0311 THE TWO DIVISIONS TOGETHER ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS TO NINETY MILLION DOLLARS IN ANNUAL SALES SAID ROBERT L. BERNSTEIN RANDOM HOUSE CHAIRMAN
493c0312 MR. BERNSTEIN NOTED THAT RANDOM HOUSE HAS EXPANDED IN OTHER DIRECTIONS NOTABLY IN TRADE PUBLISHING
493c0313 TRADE BOOKS ARE ALL BOOKS SOLD DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS IN BOOK STORES AND THROUGH MAIL ORDERS
493c0314 ANSWER YES WITHOUT QUESTION
493c0315 IT'S MY SENSE THAT THERE WAS A TIME WHEN PEOPLE THOUGHT THEY COULD TRADE ON INSIDE INFORMATION WITH ABSOLUTE IMPUNITY
493c0316 AND THAT'S NO LONGER TRUE
493c0317 NOW I AM CERTAIN THAT THERE ARE STILL PEOPLE WHO THINK THEY CAN TRADE ON INSIDE INFORMATION AND GET AWAY WITH IT BECAUSE THEY'RE SMARTER THAN THE AVERAGE PERSON
493c0318 THERE WILL ALWAYS BE THOSE PEOPLE
493c0319 BUT I THINK THAT THE ACTIONS HAVE HAD A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON CONDUCT
493c031a THIS GROWING RELIANCE ON THIRD PARTIES TO SELL PRODUCTS COULD HINDER HEWLETT PACKARD'S ABILITY TO MANAGE ITS BUSINESS AND MAKE THE COMPANY'S STOCK LESS ATTRACTIVE TO INVESTORS
493c031b <NOISE> YOU BOUGHT H. P. STOCK IN THE PAST BECAUSE IT HAD MORE CONTROL OVER ITS DESTINY THAN OTHER ELECTRONICS FIRMS MR. WU SAID
493c031c TODAY H. P. HAS LESS CONTROL OVER ITS FUTURE
493c031d SPOKESWOMAN FOR ASHLAND SAID WE HAVE BEEN OUTRAGED BY THIS ENTIRE INCIDENT
493c031e COMPANY OFFICIALS NOTIFIED FEDERAL AUTHORITIES TWO YEARS AGO THAT THE IRANIANS HAD ACCESS TO THE DOCUMENTS AND REQUESTED AN INVESTIGATION
493c031f ASHLAND WAS SHOCKED TO LEARN OF MR. ATKINS'S INVOLVEMENT THE SPOKESWOMAN SAID
493c0401 THE WORD IS TERROR
493c0402 MY FEAR OF FAILURE MAY BE GREATER IN SOME RESPECTS
493c0403 PEOPLE SAY ADVERSITY IS GOOD FOR YOU
493c0404 WELL THAT'S NOT EXACTLY TRUE
493c0405 I'M NOT THE SAME PERSON I WAS
493c0406 TRADING VOLUME HAS BEEN LETHARGIC FOR THE PAST FEW WEEKS PARTLY REFLECTING CONFUSION ABOUT THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK
493c0407 IMPORTANT CLUES ARE EXPECTED TO EMERGE FRIDAY WHEN THE LABOR DEPARTMENT REPORTS EMPLOYMENT FIGURES FOR FEBRUARY
493c0408 MANY ANALYSTS EXPECT THE STATISTICS TO INDICATE THAT THE ECONOMY REMAINS WEAK AND THAT LOWER INTEREST RATES LIE AHEAD
493c0409 BUT THE EMPLOYMENT STATISTICS ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO PREDICT AND INDIVIDUAL ESTIMATES VARY WIDELY
493c040a BUT SOME INDUSTRY ANALYSTS ARE SKEPTICAL *ABOUT* S. H. V.'S INTENTIONS
493c040b THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON THERE SAID HUMPHREY HARRISON AN ANALYST AT COUNTY SECURITIES
493c040c I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE END GAME IS BUT I DOUBT THEY S. H. V. WILL REMAIN AT TWENTY EIGHT PERCENT
493c040d MR. REINHARD REMEMBERS AN INDIAN COMMERCIAL TWO YEARS AGO AT THE PRESTIGIOUS CANNES FESTIVAL NO RELATION TO THE FILM FESTIVAL THERE
493c040e IT SHOWED A CLOSE UP OF A FLATULENT ELEPHANT'S BACKSIDE WHILE THE ANNOUNCER EXPLAINED THE SOUND IN PLAIN LANGUAGE
493c040f THE COMMERCIAL PLUGGED AN ANTACID FOR HUMANS
493c040g IT DIDN'T WIN
493c040h TEXACO FILED FOR CHAPTER ELEVEN PROTECTION CITING THE BURDEN OF ITS TEN POINT THREE BILLION DOLLAR LEGAL BATTLE WITH PENNZOIL
493c040i THE BANKRUPTCY LAW CASE THE LARGEST IN HISTORY CAME AFTER BOTH FIRMS APPARENTLY REMAINED ABOUT TWO BILLION DOLLARS APART IN SETTLEMENT TALKS
493c040j THOUGH THE FILING COMPLICATES THE BATTLE MOST EXPERTS BELIEVE NEITHER COMPANY WILL EMERGE THE WINNER
493c040k BUT THE OIL WORKERS HAD A CANDIDATE TOO AND AS THE PRIMARY DREW NEAR STRANGE THINGS STARTED HAPPENING IN EBANO
493c040l NEIGHBORHOODS WITH TAP WATER SUDDENLY FOUND THEMSELVES CUT OFF
493c040m PHONES RANG WITH DEATH THREATS
493c040n THE WORLD IS MADE UP OF OPTIMISTS AND PESSIMISTS SAYS MR. STONE
493c040o IN THIS INDUSTRY IN THIS STATE THEY'RE MOSTLY PESSIMISTS
493c040p I MAY BE THE LAST OPTIMIST BUT I'M SURE I'M RIGHT
493c040q LOCAL NEWSPAPERS YESTERDAY SAID THE GOVERNMENT MAY QUALIFY THE DECISION TO SIGN THE RESTRUCTURING AGREEMENT
493c040r BUT OFFICIAL SOURCES SAID THE SIGNING IS LIKELY TO TAKE PLACE DURING THE LAST WEEK IN SEPTEMBER
493c040s THE SIGNING DEADLINE IS OCTOBER FIRST
493c040t ART COLLECTORS AND DEALERS HEAVED A SIGH OF RELIEF LAST NIGHT
493c040u AFTER HIGH PRICES AND FRANTIC BIDDING AT ART AUCTIONS LAST SPRING ABOUT ONE IN FOUR WORKS DIDN'T SELL AT A CONTEMPORARY ART AUCTION AT CHRISTIE'S
493c040v BUT AT LEAST THE MARKET DIDN'T CRASH
493c040w NO FINAL BUDGET DECISIONS HAVE BEEN MADE AT THE WHITE HOUSE
493c040x BUDGET DRAFTING IS BEHIND SCHEDULE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES WON'T EVEN SEE O. M. B. RECOMMENDATIONS UNTIL LATER THIS WEEK
493c040y BUT IT'S ALREADY CLEAR THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS INCREASED ITS EMPHASIS ON EDUCATION
493c040z I THINK IT'S A PERFECTLY HONORABLE PROFESSION
493c0410 <NOISE> IF MORE OF US DID IT THE OPPORTUNITIES WOULD GET SMALLER BECAUSE MORE FIRMS WOULD BE COMPETING TO CLOSE THE SAME SPREADS HE SAYS
493c0411 THE PRODUCT IS A LEGITIMATE HEDGING PRODUCT AND A LEGITIMATE WAY TO ADD *LIQUIDITY* TO THE MARKET
493c0412 REAL ESTATE INDUSTRY SOURCES SAID INTENSE FRICTION BETWEEN SALVATORE RANIERI AND MR. DAVIS DEVELOPED DURING THE KIAWAH NEGOTIATIONS
493c0413 SALVATORE RANIERI DIDN'T RETURN A REPORTER'S TELEPHONE CALL
493c0414 A SPOKESMAN FOR MR. DAVIS DIDN'T DISPUTE THE REPORT OF PERSONAL FRICTION
493c0415 BANKS THAT COMMIT TO THE NEW CREDIT BY TODAY GET A FEE EQUAL TO POINT THREE SEVEN FIVE PERCENT OF THE AMOUNT THEY COMMIT
493c0416 IT WON'T BE CLEAR UNTIL AFTER THE WEEKEND HOW MANY COMMITMENTS HAVE BEEN RECEIVED
493c0417 BUT SOME BANKERS CLOSE TO THE TRANSACTION ESTIMATE THAT ABOUT EIGHTY PERCENT OR SLIGHTLY MORE THAN FOUR BILLION DOLLARS WOULD BE COMMITTED BY EARLY NEXT WEEK
493c0418 MR. LENNANE HAD STARTED THE BIDDING IN JUNE BY PROPOSING TO TAKE THE COMPANY PRIVATE FOR SEVEN DOLLARS TWENTY FIVE A SHARE
493c0419 AFTER THE BOARD RETAINED KIDDER PEABODY AND COMPANY TO REVIEW THE BID THE COMPANY MET WITH OTHER POTENTIAL ACQUIRERS
493c041a <NOISE> IN AUGUST MR. LENNANE INCREASED HIS BID TO EIGHT DOLLARS A SHARE
493c041b ASHTON TATE HAS BEEN PLAGUED BY OPERATING LOSSES AND MANAGEMENT TURMOIL
493c041c LAST MONTH IT REPORTED A NINETEEN POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR SECOND QUARTER NET LOSS AS WELL AS THE RESIGNATION OF ITS PRESIDENT AND CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER
493c041d ONCE A SOFTWARE INDUSTRY STAR THE COMPANY HAS BEEN BUFFETED BY GROWING COMPETITION IN ITS CORE DATABASE BUSINESS
494c0201 PALO VERDE IS OWNED BY SEVEN ELECTRICAL UTILITIES INCLUDING PHOENIX BASED A. Z. P. GROUP INCORPORATED'S ARIZONA PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY
494c0202 THE PLANT'S SECOND UNIT IS ALREADY SHUT DOWN FOR ROUTINE MAINTENANCE AND ISN'T SCHEDULED TO RESUME OPERATIONS UNTIL EARLY MARCH A SPOKESMAN FOR THE OPERATORS SAID
494c0203 A THIRD PALO VERDE UNIT IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION
494c0204 CARVING UP THE BOESKY FUND WOULD EFFECTIVELY END MR. BOESKY'S INVOLVEMENT IN THE SECURITIES BUSINESS
494c0205 MR. BOESKY FORMALLY HAS UNTIL APRIL FIRST NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT TO WIND UP HIS AFFAIRS UNDER AN AGREEMENT WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
494c0206 BUT THE BOESKY FUND HAS ALREADY SOLD NEARLY ALL ITS STOCK POSITIONS AND A QUICKER DISSOLUTION HAS APPEARED LIKELY FOR SOME TIME
494c0207 IT'S INCONCEIVABLE THAT THE DIRECTORATE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT MR. RODRIGUEZ COMMENTS ONE INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS WORKER WHO HAS STUDIED THE LOCAL REFUGEE SITUATION
494c0208 THE PEOPLE OF EL BARILLO ARE UNDER THE BOOT
494c0209 THEY'VE BEEN SMART ENOUGH TO SURVIVE

494c020b IN CLEVELAND HIGBEE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER ROBERT BROADBENT SAYS THE RETAILER HAS BENEFITED FROM ITS PARENT'S FINANCIAL EXPERTISE
494c020c ALTHOUGH IT WILL PROBABLY RETAIN CONTROL INDUSTRIAL EQUITY IS PLANNING TO TAKE HIGBEE PUBLIC AGAIN PROBABLY IN JUNE
494c020d MEANWHILE SAYS MR. BROADBENT THEY'VE MADE US MORE INQUISITIVE ABOUT ACQUISITIONS OURSELVES
494c020e BEING ENGLISH AND A WORKING CLASS NORTH LONDONER AT THAT IS A BIG PART OF MISS FOX'S APPEAL IN BRITAIN WHERE CLASS DISTINCTIONS STILL COUNT
494c020f THERE'S NOTHING PATRICIAN ABOUT HER LOOKS WHICH SUITS HER FANS HERE JUST FINE
494c020g A LOT OF YOUNG WOMEN HERE LOOK A LOT LIKE HER
494c020h EVEN MORE SOUND LIKE HER
494c020i AND NO ONE EXPECTS OR WANTS HER TO SUDDENLY DON SNOOTY JASPER CONRAN FROCKS AND POSE ON THE PAGES OF VOGUE
494c020j NEVERTHELESS SOME ANALYSTS SAY THE FED ALREADY MAY BE TIGHTENING CREDIT SLIGHTLY
494c020k THEY POINT TO RECENT INCREASES IN THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE WHICH IS THE RATE ON RESERVES THAT BANKS LEND EACH OTHER OVERNIGHT
494c020l THE FUNDS RATE AVERAGED ABOUT SEVEN AND FIVE EIGHTHS PERCENT YESTERDAY AND TUESDAY UP FROM AN AVERAGE OF SEVEN POINT FOUR THREE PERCENT IN THE WEEK ENDED OCTOBER SEVENTH
494c020m THESE ANALYSTS ARGUE THAT THE INCREASE WAS ENGINEERED BY THE FED
494c020n NEARLY ALL THE GAINERS WERE COMPANIES THAT SELL TO CUSTOMERS OTHER THAN PERSONAL COMPUTER MAKERS
494c020o INTEL THE BIGGEST O. T. C. SEMICONDUCTOR MAKER AND BY FAR THE LARGEST ELECTRONICS ISSUE ON NASDAQ FELL ONE QUARTER TO TWENTY THREE AND THREE QUARTERS
494c020p L. S. I. LOGIC ANOTHER BIG SEMICONDUCTOR CONCERN WITH SOME P. C. MAKING CUSTOMERS WAS UNCHANGED AT SEVEN AND THREE QUARTERS
494c020q BUT A RAFT OF SMALLER ELECTRONICS ISSUES HELPED PUSH THE NASDAQ ELECTRONICS GROUP'S AVERAGE UP MORE THAN ONE PERCENT
494c020r HOURLY COMPENSATION AT NONFINANCIAL FIRMS ROSE AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF THREE PERCENT IN NOMINAL TERMS BUT FELL EIGHT TENTHS OF A PERCENT WHEN ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION

494c020u IN AN AWKWARD REMINDER OF THE BOOM DAYS SHEARSON'S NEW LONDON HEADQUARTERS FACES AN ICE SKATING RINK BUILT JUST TO GIVE THE COMPLEX MORE GRANDEUR
494c020v OUTDOOR ORGAN MUSIC BLARES LAWRENCE WELK TUNES ONE DAY AS TWO BOYS SKATE ALONE ON THE ICE WITH HOCKEY STICKS
494c020w IT LOOKS NICE DOESN'T IT A SHEARSON OFFICIAL BITTERLY REMARKS
494c020x UNDERNEATH THE SKATING RINK IS A GYMNASIUM SHEARSON IS TRYING TO SELL
494c020y MARKET PARTICIPANTS SAY THE DEVELOPMENT DOESN'T BOTHER THEM
494c020z WE GO THROUGH THESE CYCLES SAYS JOHN WATSON PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL SECURITY TRADERS ASSOCIATION MOST OF WHOSE MEMBERS ARE O. T. C. BROKERS
494c0210 THERE ARE CERTAIN TIMES CONDUCIVE TO BRINGING OUT NEW OFFERINGS
494c0211 FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S THE BAFFLING CASE OF A YOUNG CHILD WHO SIMPLY STOPPED GROWING FOR A YEAR AND A HALF
494c0212 DOCTORS COULDN'T IDENTIFY A MEDICAL REASON
494c0213 THE TENTATIVE DIAGNOSIS HERE STRESS
494c0214 SENSING THE FAMILY AS WHOLE UNDER PRESSURE THE CHILD HAS BECOME AN EMOTIONAL CARETAKER TO THE PARENTS
494c0215 THE FINANCIAL TIMES THIRTY SHARE INDEX FELL SEVENTEEN AND A HALF POINTS TO FOURTEEN SEVENTY <NOISE> NINE POINT FOUR
494c0216 VOLUME WAS A LIGHT THREE HUNDRED SIXTY SIX POINT FOUR MILLION SHARES
494c0217 THE ONE HUNDRED SHARE INDEX WAS OFF NINETEEN POINT SIX AT EIGHTEEN FORTY FOUR POINT EIGHT
494c0218 WARNER LAMBERT AND SCHERING PLOUGH ARE COVETED FOR THEIR OVER THE COUNTER DRUGS AS WELL AS FOR PRESCRIPTION SALES
494c0219 OVER THE COUNTER DRUGS SUCH AS WARNER LAMBERT'S LISTERINE MOUTHWASH ARE THOUGHT TO HAVE FRANCHISE VALUE
494c021a THEY AREN'T RESEARCH INTENSIVE THEY'RE MARKETING INTENSIVE ONE ANALYST SAID
494c021b TODAY COLOMBIANS WHO HAVE STOOD UP OVERTLY TO THE COCAINE GANGS REMAIN A MINORITY
494c021c NOTABLE AMONG THEM IS JUSTICE MINISTER MONICA DE GREIFF
494c021d SHE HAS INTENSIFIED THE BATTLE AGAINST DRUG DEALERS DESPITE THEIR THREAT OF TOTAL WAR AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT IF THE CURRENT NARCOTICS CONTROL DRIVE CONTINUES
494c021e LIKE MS. DE GREIFF SOME JUDGES HAVE DEFIED THE GANGSTERS
494c021f MORE THAN A DOZEN JUSTICE DEPARTMENT FUNCTIONARIES HAVE BEEN KILLED THIS YEAR
494c021g THEY INCLUDE HELENA DIAZ THE MEDELLIN JUDGE WHO IN JULY REFUSED TO REVOKE ARREST WARRANTS ISSUED FOR REPUTED MEDELLIN CARTEL BOSSES
494c0301 THE COMPUTER ALSO CAN DISPLAY A PATTERN SHOWING HOW PEOPLE NORMALLY PLACE THE TONGUE TO PRODUCE SAY AN S. SOUND
494c0302 A DEAF PERSON CAN THEN TRY TO MATCH THE PATTERN BY PLACING THE TONGUE AGAINST THE ELECTRONIC PALATE
494c0303 WITH CAREFUL COACHING AND TRIAL AND ERROR CHILDREN LIKE MISS GILROY CAN LEARN HOW TO MAKE SOUNDS THAT REQUIRE PLACING THE TONGUE AGAINST THE ROOF OF THE MOUTH
494c0304 THE BUNDESBANK HAS REFUSED ANY FURTHER ACTION
494c0305 THESE DAYS IT'S POSSIBLE TO PICK UP THE PAPERS AND READ ABOUT WEST GERMAN FEARS OF REIGNITING INFLATION
494c0306 YOU HAVE TO PINCH YOURSELF TO REMEMBER THAT THE INFLATION RUNNING NEAR ZERO IN APRIL IS NOW RUNNING BELOW ZERO
494c0307 THE E. M. S. APPARENTLY MUST NOW BE REALIGNED AND THE FRANC DEVALUED TO ACCOMMODATE THE GERMAN TASTE FOR DEFLATION
494c0308 BUT THE TRADE FIGURES CAN BE AN EVEN MORE IMPORTANT INFLUENCE ON INTEREST RATES MANY ANALYSTS SAY
494c0309 IF THE JANUARY DEFICIT TURNS OUT TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER THAN THE APPROXIMATELY FOURTEEN BILLION DOLLAR GAP THAT MANY ANALYSTS EXPECT THE DOLLAR MIGHT RESUME ITS FALL
494c030a THAT COULD ALARM FOREIGN INVESTORS AND DISCOURAGE THEM FROM ADDING TO THEIR HOLDINGS OF DOLLAR DENOMINATED INVESTMENTS
494c030b THERE'S BEEN A COMPLETE TURNAROUND IN SHORT TERM SENTIMENT SAID THOMAS G. GRIBBON A SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT AT NOMURA SECURITIES INTERNATIONAL INCORPORATED
494c030c FOR WEEKS PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TRADING BEARISHLY ON DOLLAR WEAKNESS AND A RISE IN THE C. R. B. INDEX
494c030d DESPITE THE REVERSAL INVESTORS STILL ARE TAKING A CAUTIOUS STANCE AND USING THE LATEST RALLY AS A SELLING OPPORTUNITY HE ADDED
494c030e AT A MEETING WITH ANALYSTS ROBERT M. KAVNER A. T. AND T.'S CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER SAID IT APPEARS WE WILL HAVE A GOOD YEAR
494c030f BUT IN RESPONSE TO AN ANALYST'S QUESTION HE SAID EARNINGS OF TWO DOLLARS A SHARE SOUNDS STRONG
494c030g HE ALSO WARNED ANALYSTS AGAINST LOOKING AT A PARTICULAR QUARTER AND ISOLATING IT ADDING WE ARE LOOKING FOR THE ANNUAL TREND LINE
494c030h MR. MECHEM WHO HELD LITTLE TAFT STOCK HAD NEVER BEEN AN AGGRESSIVE CHAIRMAN
494c030i BUT HE HAD HIS OWN LONG HIDDEN AGENDA FOR THE COMPANY AND IT BORE A SURPRISING SIMILARITY TO WHAT THE BASS TEAM WANTED
494c030j IN MAY NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX MR. MECHEM INVITED FOUR BASS REPRESENTATIVES ONTO THE TAFT BOARD AND THE BASS TEAM BEGAN TO ENGINEER A REORGANIZATION
494c030k SOURCES SAID THAT IN THE CONTRACT TALKS BEING HELD IN LONDON IRAQI MARKETING OFFICIALS ARE INSISTING THAT TWO MAJOR OIL COMPANIES ALREADY HAVE SIGNED
494c030l BUT U. S. MAJORS KNOWN TO BE IN ON THE NEGOTIATIONS DENIED SIGNING CONTRACTS OR DECLINED TO COMMENT
494c030m WE DON'T SEE ANY JOY IN THIS FOR A U. S. REFINER YET SAID A SUPPLY OFFICIAL FOR ONE U. S. MAJOR
494c030n IN KOREA LABOR CONFLICTS HAVE ADDED HEAT TO THE UNSTABLE POLITICAL SITUATION
494c030o THE NEW UNIONS ARE GROWING MORE ADVERSARIAL
494c030p COMPANIES KEEP ASKING THE GOVERNMENT TO SMASH THE UNIONS
494c030q BUT THE RULING PARTY CAN'T RISK ALIENATING WORKERS WHO WILL VOTE IN THE COMING ELECTIONS
494c030r IT REFUSES SO FAR TO BACKTRACK ON ITS JULY FIRST PROMISE OF GREATER DEMOCRACY OR TO RETURN TO THE POLICY OF OVERT UNION BUSTING
494c030s THE TOKYO FOREIGN STOCK EXCHANGE MARKET IS CLOSED ON SATURDAYS
494c030t EUROPEAN STOCK MARKETS WERE CLOSED FRIDAY AND SATURDAY EXCEPT MILAN WHERE PRICES EDGED UP IN FRIDAY'S SESSION
494c030u THE MILAN STOCK INDEX CLOSED UP SEVEN LIRE AT TEN SIXTY SIX
494c030v THE JAPANESE FIRMS INCLUDING OURSELVES HAVE BEEN GOOD MEMBERS OF THE PRIMARY DEALER COMMUNITY SAID TOSHIO MORI CHAIRMAN OF NIKKO'S U. S. UNIT
494c030w WE ARE NOT A DISTURBING FORCE IN THIS MARKET AND I DON'T SEE ANY ADVANTAGE IN KICKING THREE JAPANESE FIRMS OUT FROM BEING PRIMARY DEALERS
494c030x WHAT IS THE ADVANTAGE FOR U. S. MARKETS AND THE U. S. ECONOMY
494c030y IT HAS NOW BEEN ELEVEN NIGHTS SINCE THE ARREST OF FRANCIS SEOW FORMER SOLICITOR GENERAL AND LAW SOCIETY PRESIDENT IN SINGAPORE
494c030z WHILE PRIME MINISTER LEE KUAN YEW'S GOVERNMENT HAS ADMITTED HOLDING MR. SEOW IT HAS KEPT HIM TOTALLY INCOMMUNICADO
494c0310 IT HAS REFUSED REQUESTS TO SEE HIM FROM BOTH HIS FAMILY AND HIS LAWYER
494c0311 BUT U. S. MANUFACTURERS WHO TOOK A BEATING DURING THE FIRST HALF OF THIS DECADE CONTINUE TO ENJOY A ROARING REVIVAL THAT BEGAN LAST YEAR
494c0312 AS A RESULT THERE IS GROWING EVIDENCE THAT FACTORY WAGE AND PRICE INCREASES ARE ACCELERATING
494c0313 AND THAT COULD LEAD THE FED TO BOOST INTEREST RATES IN AN EFFORT TO COOL DOWN THE ECONOMY IN THE COMING MONTHS
494c0314 ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE GENERAL STRIKE FACTORIES CLOSED BUT BOOKSTORES REMAINED OPEN IN THIS OLD WORLD CULTURAL CENTER
494c0315 MOST SCHOOLS WERE SHUT BUT PUSHKIN STREET NEAR THE SQUARE REVERBERATED AS USUAL WITH THE SOUND OF BADLY PLAYED CHOPIN EMANATING FROM THE OPEN WINDOWS OF THE MUSIC ACADEMY
494c0316 MANY OF THE ARMENIAN DEMANDS ARE CULTURAL
494c0317 THEY WANT THEIR OLD FLAG REINSTATED THEIR CHILDREN SENT TO ARMENIAN SCHOOLS RATHER THAN RUSSIAN ONES THEIR OWN LANGUAGE USED ON OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS
494c0318 THEIR POLITICAL DEMANDS INCLUDE CALLS FOR A SEPARATE ARMY BRIGADE AND THE RIGHT FOR ARMENIA TO HAVE CONSULATES ABROAD
494c0319 OVERALL CONSUMER SPENDING HAS SLOWED SINCE LAST YEAR'S STOCK MARKET CRASH BUT IT'S STILL AT A LEVEL THAT WORRIES SOME ECONOMISTS
494c031a CONSUMER CREDIT SLOWED SHARPLY IN JULY REFLECTING SLUGGISH SALES
494c031b TOO MUCH SPENDING AT HOME COUPLED WITH HEAVY DEMAND FOR EXPORTS COULD OVERLOAD AN INDUSTRIAL SECTOR THAT IS ALREADY RUNNING NEAR CAPACITY
494c031c CLINICAL TESTS OF GENENTECH'S C. D. FOUR IN AIDS PATIENTS WHILE STILL AT AN EARLY STAGE HAVE RUN SMOOTHLY REPORTS ONE RESEARCHER
494c031d WE HAVEN'T IDENTIFIED A CLINICAL PROBLEM WITH THIS PRODUCT SO FAR SAYS SAMUEL BRODER DIRECTOR OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY AT THE NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE
494c031e IF WE DO I'M CONFIDENT THAT THE SCIENTISTS AT GENENTECH CAN FIX IT
494c0401 I THINK THEY'RE WRONG TENNESSEE GOVERNOR LAMAR ALEXANDER THE COMMISSION CHAIRMAN SAID OF THE OPPOSITION
494c0402 HE SAID MOST OF THE PROPOSED LAND USE RESTRICTIONS WOULD BE IMPOSED BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS
494c0403 BUT HE CONCEDED THAT SECTIONS OF THE REPORT ON FEDERAL LANDS ARE BEING REWRITTEN
494c0404 JEWISH ACTIVIST IOSIF BEGUN SAID HE PLANNED TO IMMIGRATE TO ISRAEL
494c0405 BEGUN WAS FREED FRIDAY FROM A SOVIET PRISON WHERE HE HAD BEEN JAILED MORE THAN THREE YEARS AGO FOR ANTI STATE ACTIVITIES
494c0406 SEPARATELY ISRAELI OFFICIALS URGED THE UNITED STATES TO DENY FREE ENTRY TO JEWS WHO LEAVE THE SOVIET UNION SAYING THEY SHOULD SETTLE IN ISRAEL
494c0407 THEY HAVE PUT IN A LOT OF MONEY BUT IS THAT ENOUGH
494c0408 NOBODY KNOWS SAID MR. BRAY
494c0409 IN OCTOBER WE THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE ENOUGH BUT BETWEEN OCTOBER AND NOW IT'S PROVEN TO BE NOT ENOUGH
494c040a WHO KNOWS HOW MUCH IT WILL BE
494c040b AT W. F. I. A. RUNNING THE FORMULA LAST JANUARY THIRTIETH MEANT BUYING MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND SHARES OF REEBOK QUICKLY
494c040c THAT'S BECAUSE W. F. I. A. LIKES TO OWN ALL THE STOCKS IN THE S. AND P. FIVE HUNDRED INDEX IN AMOUNTS SCALED TO THEIR MARKET WEIGHT
494c040d THOSE HOLDINGS RANGE FROM MORE THAN ONE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS OF I. B. M. TO JUST SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS OF ALLIS CHALMERS CORPORATION
494c040e WHAT THIS SHOW REALLY IS THEN IS AN HOMAGE TO THE LATE SPANISH MASTER
494c040f IF ONE ACCEPTS THE SHOW ON THAT BASIS IT IS SUCCESSFUL DESPITE ITS GAPS
494c040g IN FACT THE GREATER WEIGHT GIVEN MIRO'S EARLIER PAINTINGS WORKS TO ADVANTAGE HERE FOR MANY OF HIS BEST PICTURES WERE DONE BEFORE THE MID NINETEEN THIRTIES
494c040h AFTER THAT HIS WORK WAS SOMEWHAT UNEVEN
494c040i BUT JACK CORBETT THE GROUP'S INTERIM PRESIDENT SAYS THE ORGANIZATION PREFERS HAVING POLICY DIRECTORS WITH EXPERTISE IN AVIATION
494c040j THE DUES HE SAYS ENTITLE MEMBERS TO SEVERAL TRAVEL ASSISTANCE SERVICES SUCH AS A HOTLINE FOR HELPING FIND LOST LUGGAGE
494c040k THE GROUP ALSO WILL LOBBY FOR IMPROVEMENTS IN AIRLINE SERVICE
494c040l WE THINK OUR BACKGROUND WILL HELP US COME UP WITH SOLUTIONS HE SAYS
494c040m ASKED ABOUT A NEW PRESIDENTIAL AID REQUEST JIM WRIGHT TALKED ABOUT MORALITY
494c040n IF I SCHEDULE IT THE PRESIDENT WOULD HAVE SOME MORAL RESPONSIBILITY TO HELP PASS IT HE SAID
494c040o I DON'T WANT TO RUN IT OUT THERE AND BE DEFEATED AGAIN
494c040p MR. WRIGHT SHOULD BE LESS TIMID IN HIS CONVICTIONS
494c040q AFTER ALL HE ISN'T THE ONE WHO HAS TO RISK GETTING HIT OVER THE HEAD WITH A METAL PIPE
494c040r PILLSBURY'S LOSS COMPARES WITH EARNINGS OF FORTY EIGHT POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OR FIFTY SIX CENTS A SHARE IN THE YEAR EARLIER QUARTER
494c040s REVENUE FELL TWO PERCENT IN THE LATEST PERIOD TO ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS FROM ONE POINT FIVE THREE BILLION DOLLARS
494c040t THE REVENUE DECLINE CAME FROM PILLSBURY'S RESTAURANT BUSINESS
494c040u IF DOCTOR HAMMER WERE TO DIE TOMORROW THE CHECK TO HIS FOUNDATION WOULD BE MORE THAN NINETEEN MILLION DOLLARS
494c040v BUT OCCIDENTAL AND DOCTOR HAMMER APPARENTLY DON'T FORESEE AN IMMEDIATE USE OF THE CLAUSE THAT WILL BENEFIT THE FOUNDATION
494c040w THE CHAIRMAN'S EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT RUNS AT LEAST TO FEBRUARY FIRST NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT AT WHICH TIME DOCTOR HAMMER WILL BE NINETY NINE
494c040x AFTER THAT THE CONTRACT AUTOMATICALLY EXTENDS INDEFINITELY
494c040y BUT THE GENERAL PINOCHET IS MORE LIKELY TO SUPPORT WHICHEVER CIVILIAN CANDIDATE PLEDGES TO RETAIN HIS ANTI COMMUNIST POLICIES AND SUCH A PERSON HAS A GOOD CHANCE OF WINNING
494c040z CHILE A PROTECTIONIST BACKWATER IN THE EARLY NINETEEN SEVENTIES NOW HAS A DYNAMIC AND OPEN EXPORT CAPABLE ECONOMY
494c0410 MOST VOTERS APPROVE OF THIS TRANSFORMATION AS SHOWN BY THE FACT THAT ALMOST NONE OF THE SIXTEEN CURRENT OPPOSITION PARTIES CALL FOR A REVERSAL OF CURRENT ECONOMIC POLICIES
494c0411 THE ALLENDE CHAOS IS STILL VIVIDLY REMEMBERED
494c0412 DETAILS ARE STILL MURKY ABOUT THE REST OF THE CREDITS
494c0413 ITALIAN OFFICIALS SAY THAT ROME'S DECISION TO GRANT ABOUT A SEVEN HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR GUARANTEE OF EXPORT CREDITS WAS PRIMARILY A POLITICAL RATHER THAN A BANKING DECISION
494c0414 BRITAIN'S MIDLAND BANK HAS ANNOUNCED PLANS FOR A ONE BILLION DOLLAR CREDIT LINE THOUGH SOME BRITISH BANKS MAY BE GETTING COLD FEET ABOUT PARTICIPATING
494c0415 FRENCH BANKS HAVE YET TO ANNOUNCE THEIR PLANS OFFICIALLY BUT ARE SAID TO BE CONSIDERING LOANS OF TWO BILLION DOLLARS
494c0416 WITH THE U. S. GOVERNMENT AS ITS PRIME CUSTOMER TRACOR WAS HELPLESS WHEN DEFENSE SPENDING SLOWED
494c0417 <NOISE> INTERNALLY MR. INMAN SAYS HE DISCOVERED THAT EXPENSES COULDN'T BE CUT AS EASILY AS BANKERS HAD FORECAST
494c0418 AND FEES WERE HIGHER THAN EXPECTED
494c0419 MR. INMAN CALLS IT ALL PART OF MY EDUCATION
494c041a THE CRACK EPIDEMIC HAS JUST ABOUT SILENCED LIBERAL OPPOSITION TO TOUGH LAW AND ORDER POLICIES
494c041b IT IS OBVIOUSLY RIDICULOUS TO TALK ABOUT REHABILITATING AN UZI TOTING DRUG PUSHER WHO MAKES FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A WEEK
494c041c HIS PROBLEM IS NOT LACK OF SELF ESTEEM
494c041d THERE IS NOTHING A SOCIAL WORKER IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO FOR HIM ESPECIALLY SINCE THE SOCIAL WORKER IS TOO AFRAID TO VENTURE INTO HIS NEIGHBORHOOD
495c0201 AT W. F. I. A. RUNNING THE FORMULA LAST JANUARY THIRTIETH MEANT BUYING MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND SHARES OF REEBOK QUICKLY
495c0202 THAT'S BECAUSE W. F. I. A. LIKES TO OWN ALL THE STOCKS IN THE S. AND P. FIVE HUNDRED INDEX IN AMOUNTS SCALED TO THEIR MARKET WEIGHT
495c0203 THOSE HOLDINGS RANGE FROM MORE THAN ONE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS OF I. B. M. TO JUST SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS OF ALLIS CHALMERS CORPORATION
495c0204 CONTINENTAL'S SPOKESMAN CONCEDED THE AIRLINE WAS SLOW IN SOME REFUNDS BUT HE SAID THE PROBLEM STEMMED FROM ITS MERGER WITH PEOPLE EXPRESS EARLIER THIS YEAR
495c0205 THAT CARRIER HAD MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND TICKETS THAT NEEDED TO BE REFUNDED WHEN ITS OPERATIONS WERE JOINED WITH CONTINENTAL'S THE SPOKESMAN SAID
495c0206 HE INSISTED THAT MOST OF THE REFUNDS WERE COMPLETED
495c0207 GENERAL RAMOS ALSO CONFIRMED FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT PHILIPPINE AUTHORITIES WERE LOOKING INTO POSSIBLE FOREIGN INVOLVEMENT IN THE COUP ATTEMPT THE ASSOCIATED PRESS REPORTED
495c0208 GENERAL RAMOS SAID THE MILITARY WAS INVESTIGATING THE PRESENCE OF SOME FOREIGN PERSONNEL NEAR ARMED FORCES HEADQUARTERS DURING THE UPRISING
495c0209 HE DECLINED TO ELABORATE
495c020a A DIGITAL SPOKESMAN SAID THE COURT ACTION DOESN'T CHANGE THE STATUS QUO
495c020b THE PART OF THE RULING THAT WAS OVERTURNED HASN'T BEEN IN EFFECT SINCE LAST JANUARY WHEN EMULEX OBTAINED THE STAY HE SAID
495c020c HE ADDED THAT THE PARAGRAPHS OF THE ORDER THAT WERE UPHELD CONTINUE TO PROHIBIT EMULEX FROM USING TRADE SECRETS THAT DIGITAL SAYS WERE STOLEN FROM IT
495c020d THE HUGE GAP TO A LARGE EXTENT IS A PRICE PHENOMENON
495c020e THE DOLLAR'S FALL HAS PUSHED UP THE PRICE OF IMPORTS CAUSING THE DEFICIT TO SWELL EVEN AS THE VOLUME OF NON OIL IMPORTS HAS RECEDED
495c020f BUT LONG BEFORE NOW THESE HIGHER PRICES WERE SUPPOSED TO LEAD TO IMPROVEMENT IN THE MONTHLY MERCHANDISE TRADE DEFICIT AS WELL
495c020g BIDS TOTALING THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS WERE SUBMITTED
495c020h ACCEPTED BIDS RANGED FROM SEVEN POINT ONE FIVE PERCENT TO SEVEN POINT ONE SEVEN THREE PERCENT
495c020i THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY SLATED ANOTHER FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR SALE NEXT TUESDAY
495c020j BUT FOR MOST MUTUAL FUND INVESTORS THE TAX BITE THIS YEAR WILL BE BIGGER THAN EVER
495c020k HOLDERS ARE TAXED ON A HUNDRED PERCENT OF REALIZED CAPITAL GAINS UNDER THE NEW TAX LAW FOR INSTANCE
495c020l PREVIOUSLY SIXTY PERCENT WAS EXCLUDED FROM TAXATION
495c020m ANY GAIN CREDITED TO INVESTORS BY THEIR FUND IS CONSIDERED REALIZED WHETHER THE HOLDER ACTUALLY SELLS ANY FUND SHARES OR NOT
495c020n ARTICLES BEGAN APPEARING ABOUT THE RISE OF THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT A GROUP THAT SEEMED TO BE DEALT WITH MORE AS ANTHROPOLOGY THAN JOURNALISM
495c020o AFTER WATCHING EVANGELICAL T. V. MINISTERS NORMAN LEAR BEGAN SPENDING HIS FORTUNE ON A GROUP CALLED PEOPLE FOR THE AMERICAN WAY

499c040n THESE TRENDS HE SAID ARE REDRESSING THE TRADE IMBALANCES THAT HELPED PROVOKE THE DOLLAR'S FALL <NOISE>
499c040o I DON'T WANT TO BE EUPHORIC YOU KNOW BUT I THINK IT'S UNDER WAY
499c040p MR. POEHL ADDED
499c040q WHILE MR. ARROYO WORKED IN PRESIDENT AQUINO'S OFFICE AND SAW HER EVERY DAY MR. ONGPIN WAS STILL HALFWAY AROUND THE WORLD BARGAINING WITH THE BANKERS <NOISE>
499c040r TO CHEER ON HIS EXHAUSTED TEAM MEMBERS HE OUTFITTED THEM ONE DAY IN YELLOW NECKTIES THE COLOR OF THE AQUINO REVOLUTION
499c040s ON MARCH TWENTY SEVENTH MR. ONGPIN REACHED A DEAL
499c040t THE SUIT WAS FILED LAST MONTH ONLY TWO DAYS AFTER A SENATE BANKING COMMITTEE HEARING ON DUAL STOCK CLASSES HELD BY SENATORS
499c040u RICHARD C. SHELBY D- DEMOCRAT ALABAMA AND WILLIAM ARMSTRONG REPUBLICAN COLORADO OPPONENTS OF THE TWO TIER STOCKS
499c040v COMMITTEE STAFFERS SAY THE TWO MAY BE LAYING THE GROUNDWORK TO AMEND PENDING LEGISLATION TO OUTLAW DUAL STOCK CLASSES
499c040w JAMES L. WINOKUR OF PITTSBURGH IS AN ART EXPERT AND TRUSTEE OF CARNEGIE INSTITUTE
499c040x IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN AND AGAIN IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT HE DONATED TEN PERCENT INTERESTS IN FORTY FOUR ART WORKS TO CARNEGIE'S MUSEUM
499c040y EACH GIFT ENTITLED IT TO POSSESSION FOR A PROPORTIONAL PART OF A YEAR BUT THE MUSEUM DIDN'T EXERCISE ITS RIGHT
499c040z IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE WINOKUR DONATED HIS REMAINING EIGHTY PERCENT INTEREST IN FIVE WORKS THE MUSEUM THEN TOOK THOSE FIVE
499c0410 WINOKUR VALUED THE ART HIMSELF AND TOOK PROPORTIONAL CHARITABLE DEDUCTIONS FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS
499c0411 THE DISPUTE IS A CLASSIC CONFRONTATION BETWEEN MARKET PHILOSOPHIES
499c0412 WASHINGTON BELIEVES THAT JAPAN PROFITS FROM FREE U. S. MARKETS AND SHOULD RECIPROCATE WITH COMPLETELY FREE JAPANESE MARKETS
499c0413 TOKYO GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRATS CLAIM TO FAVOR FREE MARKETS IN PRACTICE THEY OFTEN ARE LOATH TO RELINQUISH COMPLETE CONTROL ESPECIALLY IN PROMISING INDUSTRIES
499c0414 INVESTORS ALSO PREFER REMICS BACKED BY SWAP TEN PERCENT SECURITIES BECAUSE PREPAYMENTS ARE LESS VOLATILE
499c0415 FREDDIE MAC PASSES THROUGH ACTUAL PREPAYMENTS ON SWAP MORTGAGE ISSUES WHILE IT ESTIMATES PREPAYMENTS ON THE CASH ISSUES
499c0416 PREPAYMENTS ON FREDDIE MAC CASH ISSUES ARE MUCH MORE VOLATILE FROM MONTH TO MONTH THAN PREPAYMENTS ON THE SWAP ISSUES
499c0417 THE IMPROVEMENT IN SEPTEMBER'S TRADE DEFICIT MOSTLY CAME ON THE EXPORT SIDE
499c0418 BUT BECAUSE OF THE POSTAL STRIKE THE DEADLINE FOR REPORTING EXPORTS WAS EXTENDED BY TWO DAYS
499c0419 THAT DATA WAS ALSO AFFECTED BY THE UNUSUAL AMOUNT OF PRECIOUS STONES AND AIRCRAFT RELATED ITEMS REPORTED IN SEPTEMBER
499c041a NOW QUICK RECOGNITION OF LOSSES IS NOT ONLY GOOD INVESTMENT STRATEGY BUT GOOD ECONOMIC STRATEGY
499c041b FULL DEDUCTIBILITY WOULD PROMOTE MOBILITY OF CAPITAL AND EFFICIENT PRICING OF ASSETS
499c041c IT WOULD OBVIOUSLY PROMOTE MORE VENTURE CAPITAL WITH HIGH GAINS AND HIGH RISKS
499c041d MERE INDEXING BY CONTRAST WOULD HELP THE BIG AND DULL INVESTMENTS WITH LOW RISKS AND HUMDRUM REWARDS
499c041e BUT IF FULL DEDUCTIBILITY OF LOSSES WOULD BE GOOD FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH IT WOULD BE BAD IN TWO OTHER WAYS
49ac0201 THE OPERATING RATE IS STILL KIND OF LOW BUT IT'S COMING BACK SAID PRISCILLA LUCE SENIOR ECONOMIST AT WHARTON ECONOMETRIC FORECASTING ASSOCIATES IN PHILADELPHIA
49ac0202 THERE IS SOME CAUSE FOR OPTIMISM
49ac0203 SHE SAID EXPORT GAINS HAVE SPURRED SOME OF THE IMPROVEMENT
49ac0204 TEXAS STARTED EVALUATING POTENTIAL S. S. C. SITES ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO AND NOW HAS SOLID DATA ON SIX LOCATIONS SAYS DILLARD HAMMETT STATE ENERGY ADVISER
49ac0205 FOUR MORE COMMUNITIES HAVE SINCE ASKED TO BE INCLUDED
49ac0206 <NOISE> CONSIDERING THE STATE'S FLAT RELATIVELY EARTHQUAKE FREE LANDSCAPE MR. HAMMETT SAYS NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF TEXAS COULD HAVE THE SITE
49ac0207 THERE'S PROBABLY ALSO A PSYCHOLOGICAL SIDE TO AUGUSTA NATIONAL'S ACCENT ON EXPERIENCE
49ac0208 THE COLOR THAT'S SECOND ONLY TO GREEN HEREABOUTS IS GRAY
49ac0209 IT CAN BE FOUND MOSTLY ON THE HEADS OF PARTICIPANTS AND SPECTATORS
49ac020a GAINS FROM ASSET SALES COULD OFFSET THE BANK'S INCREASED LOAN LOSS PROVISIONS IN LATER QUARTERS
49ac020b MELLON'S INTERIM CHIEF EXECUTIVE NATHAN PEARSON TOLD SHAREHOLDERS AT THE BANK'S ANNUAL MEETING MONDAY THAT HE EXPECTS MELLON TO RETURN TO PROFITABILITY THIS YEAR
49ac020c BUT SEVERAL PROFITABLE MELLON BUSINESSES INCLUDING TRUST OPERATIONS AND DATA PROCESSING COULD BE SWAMPED BY CONTINUED LOSSES FROM ENERGY AND REAL ESTATE LOANS
49ac020d THIS YEAR THE SAME FORCES ARE AT WORK
49ac020e I BELIEVE THE CHANCES OF A REPEAT OF LAST YEAR'S PERFORMANCE ARE HIGH SAYS WILLIAM STERLING A MERRILL LYNCH ECONOMIST IN TOKYO
49ac020f <NOISE> HE EXPECTS TO SEE ONLY ABOUT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS OF ADDITIONAL SPENDING NOT THE THIRTY SIX BILLION DOLLARS THAT MR. NAKASONE IS TALKING ABOUT
49ac020g IN A LETTER TO SUPPORTERS MR. NUNN SAID HIS POSITION AS CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE FORECLOSED A RUN FOR THE WHITE HOUSE
49ac020h IF I ATTEMPTED TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT AND ALSO CARRY OUT MY SENATE DUTIES I WOULD WIND UP DOING NEITHER WELL HE WROTE
49ac020i MR. NUNN ALSO EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT THE IMPACT OF A PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN ON MY FAMILY
49ac020j THE CONFRONTATION IN FEDERAL COURT MAY BREAK NEW GROUND IN BANKRUPTCY LAW
49ac020k OTHER COURTS NOTABLY THE ONE IN CHARGE OF THE MANVILLE CORPORATION CHAPTER ELEVEN PROCEEDINGS HAVE SET UP TRUST FUNDS TO PAY LARGE CLASSES OF INJURY VICTIMS
49ac020l <NOISE> BUT MANVILLE'S TWO POINT FIVE BILLION TO THREE BILLION DOLLAR TRUST INCLUDES PROVISIONS THAT ALLOW IT TO EXPAND IF FUNDS PROVE INADEQUATE TO PAY ASBESTOS RELATED CLAIMS
49ac020m SO FAR NO JUDGE HAS ATTEMPTED TO FIX AN ABSOLUTE CAP ON A GROUP OF CLAIMS AS HUGE AND UNCERTAIN AS THOSE FACING ROBINS
49ac020n ANOTHER REASON MR. SOIFER IS AVOIDING MORGAN AND CITICORP IS THAT THEIR STOCK PRICES AT TIMES HAVE TENDED TO GYRATE MORE VIOLENTLY THAN OTHER BANK ISSUES
49ac020o CITICORP AND MORGAN TEND TO HAVE MORE VOLATILITY ON DAYS WHEN PROGRAM TRADING IS KNOWN TO OCCUR MR. SOIFER SAYS
49ac020p THEY'RE MORE OF A BET ON WHICH WAY THE MARKET IS HEADED
49ac020q IN THE TWO SELECTED AREAS THE STATE WILL ALLOW PROCUREMENT AND RETAIL PRICES TO RISE TO WHAT THE OPEN MARKET DEMANDS
49ac020r THE SUBSIDY FOR CONSUMERS IS MEANT TO REDUCE THE STRAIN ON URBAN RESIDENTS
49ac020s FARMERS OF COURSE WILL GET HIGHER PRICES FOR THEIR GRAIN FROM THE MARKET WHICH IN TURN SHOULD INDUCE THEM TO INCREASE PRODUCTION
49ac020t GRAIN PRODUCTION THROUGHOUT CHINA HAS FALTERED IN RECENT YEARS IN PART BECAUSE STATE PROCUREMENT PRICES WERE TOO LOW
49ac020u NICARAGUA'S SANDINISTAS BLAMED A HARDLINE CONTRA FACTION LED BY MILITARY COMMANDER ENRIQUE BERMUDEZ FOR SLOWING PROGRESS IN FOUR DAYS OF PEACE TALKS THAT ENDED MONDAY IN MANAGUA
49ac020v NEGOTIATIONS ARE SCHEDULED TO CONTINUE NEXT WEEK
49ac020w THEY SAID BERMUDEZ FAVORED CONTINUED MILITARY EFFORTS TO OUST THE RULING SANDINISTA REGIME
49ac020x <NOISE> LAST YEAR SEVERAL MAJOR CITIES INCLUDING JACKSONVILLE FLORIDA AND CHARLOTTE NORTH CAROLINA PROHIBITED OR SEVERELY RESTRICTED CONSTRUCTION OF NEW OUTDOOR ADVERTISEMENTS
49ac020y JUST LAST MONTH SAINT LOUIS ADOPTED A BILLBOARD BAN
49ac020z AND OFFICIALS IN RICHMOND VIRGINIA AND DENVER ARE CONSIDERING CRACKING DOWN
49ac0210 WORLD BANK PRESIDENT BARBER CONABLE SAID THE BANK WILL SEND A DELEGATION TO ARGENTINA NEXT WEEK TO REVIEW THE MEASURES
49ac0211 IF THE BANK APPROVES THE DETAILS THE BRIDGE LOAN WOULD GO FORWARD AND THE WORLD BANK LOANS WOULD BE COMPLETED
49ac0212 A BANK SPOKESMAN SAID DETAILS OF THOSE LOANS WON'T BE KNOWN UNTIL THE DELEGATION COMPLETES ITS WORK
49ac0213 ESTIMATES OF THE MAKEUP OF THE FEEDLOT POPULATION VARY WIDELY
49ac0214 MOST ANALYSTS EXPECT THE GOVERNMENT TO REPORT THAT THE NUMBER OF YOUNG CATTLE PLACED ON FEEDLOTS FELL IN JULY FOR THE SECOND CONSECUTIVE MONTH FROM A YEAR EARLIER
49ac0215 HOWEVER SOME EXPECT A RISE
49ac0216 HE IS STRIKING NOW AT A TIME WHEN FINANCING FOR BIG DEALS IS READILY AVAILABLE AND THE STOCK PRICE IS DOWN
49ac0217 AS RECENTLY AS AUGUST R. J. R.'S STOCK WAS TRADING LOWER THAN ITS FORTY NINE DOLLAR LEVEL WHEN MR. JOHNSON TOOK OVER IN JANUARY NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
49ac0218 THE OFFER FOR A LEVERAGED BUY OUT PROBABLY WILL BE AT ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS A SHARE AND NOW OTHER TOBACCO STOCKS ARE SOARING TOO
49ac0219 <NOISE> IN THE PAST YEAR AND A HALF I. B. M. HAS BOUGHT PIECES OF NEARLY A DOZEN COMPANIES STEPPING UP THE PACE IN RECENT MONTHS
49ac021a <NOISE> THE COMPUTER GIANT IS MAINLY TRYING TO BUY TECHNOLOGY OR EXPERTISE IN CERTAIN AREAS SUCH AS SOFTWARE FOR INSURANCE COMPANIES IN THE CASE OF ITS POLICY MANAGEMENT STAKE
49ac021b I. B. M. ALSO SEEMS TO BE TRYING TO BUY SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS' LOYALTY IN THE INCREASINGLY COMPETITIVE INDUSTRY
49ac021c <NOISE> INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR SMALL MEDICAL BILLS IS ESPECIALLY WASTEFUL
49ac021d USUALLY IT WILL COST AN INSURER MORE THAN FIFTY DOLLARS TO MONITOR EFFECTIVELY A FIFTY DOLLAR PHYSICIAN BILL THEREBY DOUBLING THE COST OF HEALTH INSURANCE
49ac021e BUT FAILURE TO MONITOR ENCOURAGES PATIENTS AND DOCTORS TO MAKE WASTEFUL DECISIONS WITHOUT FEAR OF THIRD PARTY SCRUTINY
49ac0301 IT'S INCONCEIVABLE THAT THE DIRECTORATE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT MR. RODRIGUEZ COMMENTS ONE INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS WORKER WHO HAS STUDIED THE LOCAL REFUGEE SITUATION
49ac0302 THE PEOPLE OF EL BARILLO ARE UNDER THE BOOT
49ac0303 THEY'VE BEEN SMART ENOUGH TO SURVIVE
49ac0304 <NOISE> THEY'VE ADAPTED
49ac0305 TO GET ITS MESSAGE TO MADISON AVENUE DECISION MAKERS WHITTLE COMMUNICATIONS HAS BEEN RUNNING A SERIES OF SLICK ADS IN NEWSPAPERS AND MEDIA TRADE JOURNALS
49ac0306 WE'RE WASTING A LOT OF MONEY ON THIS AD ANNOUNCES A BOLD HEADLINE IN ONE
49ac0307 THE POINT VIRTUALLY EVERY ADVERTISER IN EVERY MEDIUM IS PAYING TO REACH VIEWERS OR READERS WHO NEVER BECOME CUSTOMERS
49ac0308 NO OTHER LIKELY BIDDERS STEPPED FORWARD YESTERDAY
49ac0309 HOSTILE TAKEOVERS ARE ALMOST UNHEARD OF IN THE DEFENSE INDUSTRY
49ac030a BUT ANALYSTS HAVE SPECULATED THAT EITHER FORD MOTOR COMPANY OR GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY MIGHT BE A GOOD FIT WITH BOEING IF THE COMPANIES WERE INTERESTED
49ac030b FORD FOR INSTANCE HAS INDICATED IT IS LOOKING FOR ACQUISITIONS AND HAS ACCUMULATED ABOUT NINE BILLION DOLLARS IT COULD USE FOR SUCH PURPOSES
49ac030c A FORD SPOKESMAN CITING COMPANY POLICY WOULD NEITHER CONFIRM NOR DENY SPECULATION ABOUT ITS INTEREST
49ac030d G. E. DECLINED COMMENT BUT A SOURCE CLOSE TO THE COMPANY SAID IT ISN'T INTERESTED IN BOEING
49ac030e PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURER FIREMAN'S FUND HAS SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE MADE THREE UNFORESEEN ADDITIONS TO RESERVES FOR CLAIMS TOTALING MORE THAN ONE BILLION DOLLARS
49ac030f JOHN BYRNE FIREMAN'S CHAIRMAN SAYS HE'S CONFIDENT FIREMAN'S IS USING EXCESS RESOURCES TO RETIRE STOCK
49ac030g <NOISE> BUT HE CONCEDES BUY BACKS CAN BE RISKY FOR INSURERS
49ac030h ALSO BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANIES ARE CASH GUZZLERS CONSTANTLY NEEDING MONEY FOR CLINICAL TRIALS AND MANUFACTURING FACILITIES
49ac030i THE CRITICAL FACTOR FOR MOST COMPANIES ISN'T HOW MUCH CASH THEY HAVE BUT HOW IT'S BEING SPENT MR. MACCALLUM SAYS
49ac030j SOME COMPANIES THAT ARE SELLING AT CLOSE TO THEIR PER SHARE CASH VALUES ARE CORRECTLY BEING PERCEIVED IN A SKEPTICAL LIGHT HE CONTENDS
49ac030k MR. SCHMIED IS BEING TESTED EARLY IN A POSITION HE DIDN'T SEEM EAGER TO OCCUPY
49ac030l ANALYSTS SAY HE IS AN OPERATIONS MAN WHO NEVER EXHIBITED ANY AMBITION TO BECOME CHIEF EXECUTIVE
49ac030m I NEVER GOT THE OVERWHELMING SENSE THAT HE WAS EAGER TO SUCCEED MR. FLAVIN SAYS CHRISTOPHER DEMISCH AN ANALYST AT FIRST BOSTON CORP.
49ac030n <NOISE> MOREOVER MR. SAWYER ISN'T THOUGHT TO POSSESS A LOT OF CLOUT
49ac030o HE DOESN'T FIT THE BOSS IMAGE THAT THE LATE MAYOR DALEY MADE FAMOUS AND THAT MAYOR WASHINGTON WAS BEGINNING TO ACQUIRE
49ac030p HE'S A WEAK GUY SAYS MR. ROSE THE POLITICAL CONSULTANT SUBJECT TO A LOT OF PRESSURE AND OBVIOUSLY NOT A CRUSADER
49ac030q ASKED HOW HE VIEWED THE PRUDENTIAL BACHE UNIT MR. WINTERS SAID ARE WE PLEASED WITH THEIR RESULTS
49ac030r <NOISE> OF COURSE NOT
49ac030s ARE WE PLEASED WITH THEIR DIRECTION
49ac030t YES
49ac030u <NOISE> <NOISE> MR. WINTERS ADDED THAT PRUDENTIAL BACHE MAY BE MORE DELIBERATE THIS YEAR IN SOME OF ITS EXPANSION
49ac030v HE ALSO VOICED CONFIDENCE IN CHAIRMAN GEORGE BALL DESPITE THE LOSSES CALLING HIM THE MOST QUALIFIED GUY IN THE U. S.
49ac030w FOR AUTHORS AND PUBLISHERS A NEW COMPETITOR IN THE BOOK CLUB FIELD IS A GODSEND
49ac030x BOOK CLUB RIGHTS ARE SECOND ONLY TO PAPERBACK RIGHTS IN PROVIDING ADDITIONAL REVENUE FOR PUBLISHERS
49ac030y FURTHERMORE A BOOK CLUB IMPRIMATUR ON A BOOK GIVES IT ENORMOUS CACHET WITH BOOKSTORE MANAGERS
49ac030z <NOISE> NOT LONG AFTER THE NORTHWEST ANNOUNCEMENT THE INSTITUTE WIRED A PRESS RELEASE TO MEDIA ORGANIZATIONS DETAILING THE LARGE NUMBER OF PASSENGER COMPLAINTS ABOUT NORTHWEST'S SERVICE
49ac0310 AIRLINE PASSENGERS WHO FLY NORTHWEST APPEAR TO HAVE A LOT TO COMPLAIN ABOUT AND THEY DID SO IN DROVES LAST YEAR THE RELEASE BEGAN
49ac0311 IT WENT ON TO SAY THAT COMPLAINTS AGAINST NORTHWEST INCREASED ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN PERCENT IN THE PAST YEAR
49ac0312 MANY BLAME THAT CHANGE ON SIMPLE GEOGRAPHY AND AN EFFORT TO MOVE AWAY FROM UNIONS
49ac0313 BUT SOME CRITICS ALSO ACCUSE THE JAPANESE COMPANIES OF DELIBERATELY AVOIDING BLACKS
49ac0314 <NOISE> HONDA AND THE U. S. EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION SETTLED A BIG RACIAL DISCRIMINATION CASE LAST MONTH
49ac0315 THE TWO LABORATORIES THAT NICHOLS PURCHASED ARE IN LINCOLN NEBRASKA AND SIOUX CITY IOWA
49ac0316 <NOISE> INITIAL PAYMENTS FOR THE LABS TOTALED ELEVEN POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN CASH AND PREFERRED STOCK
49ac0317 ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS TO BE MADE OVER AN EIGHT YEAR PERIOD HAVE A CURRENT VALUE OF SIX POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS NICHOLS SAID
49ac0318 THE ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS ARE CONTINGENT UPON CERTAIN MATERIAL ASPECTS OF THE BUSINESS OF THE TWO LABS REMAINING INTACT FOR THREE YEARS NICHOLS SAID
49ac0319 SINCE MONDAY'S OPENING BELL N. C. N. B. SHARES HAVE JUMPED FOUR AND THREE EIGHTHS POINTS CLOSING AT TWENTY SEVEN AND SEVEN EIGHTHS YESTERDAY
49ac031a MANY ANALYSTS PREDICT THE STOCK COULD GO HIGHER SOON PERHAPS CROSSING THE THIRTY DOLLAR A SHARE BARRIER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A YEAR
49ac031b LONG TERM BULLS PREDICT N. C. N. B.'S PRICE COULD EASILY DOUBLE AND SOME SAY TRIPLE
49ac031c THE AGENCY HAS BEEN UNDER GROWING PRESSURE FROM REPRESENTATIVE JOHN DINGELL DEMOCRAT MICHIGAN AND OTHER LAWMAKERS TO TIGHTEN REGULATION OF THE GENERICS INDUSTRY
49ac031d SENATOR ORRIN HATCH REPUBLICAN UTAH RANKING MINORITY MEMBER ON THE SENATE LABOR AND HUMAN RESOURCES COMMITTEE WELCOMED THE PLAN
49ac031e <NOISE> IT IS MY STRONG BELIEF THAT SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE HAS BEEN UNCOVERED TO WARRANT THESE CHANGES HE SAID IN A STATEMENT
49ac0401 IT'S A SAD DAY FOR WALL STREET SAID A FIRST BOSTON CORP. SPOKESMAN
49ac0402 STOCK TRADERS CAUTIONED THAT THE GOVERNMENT HASN'T YET WON CONVICTIONS ON ITS LATEST CASES
49ac0403 <NOISE> BUT BOTH LAWMAKERS AND STOCK MARKET PROFESSIONALS SAID YESTERDAY'S ARRESTS SEND A CLEAR SIGNAL AN OVERHAUL OF TAKEOVER AND SECURITIES PRACTICES HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY LIKELY
49ac0404 SENATOR WILLIAM PROXMIRE DEMOCRAT WISCONSIN SHARPLY CRITICIZED THE FED FOR DROPPING THE M. ONE TARGET
49ac0405 HE ALSO CONTENDED THAT IT IS AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS AND UNWISE POLICY TO ALLOW M. ONE TO EXPAND AS RAPIDLY AS IT HAS
49ac0406 LAST YEAR M. ONE WHICH CONSISTS OF CHECKING DEPOSITS PLUS CASH HELD BY THE PUBLIC SOARED FIFTEEN POINT TWO PERCENT
49ac0407 THAT WAS FAR ABOVE THE FED'S TARGET OF THREE PERCENT TO EIGHT PERCENT
49ac0408 WHEN HU YAOBANG WAS DUMPED IN JANUARY AS THE COMMUNIST PARTY'S SECRETARY GENERAL MR. ZHAO WAS ELEVATED TO THAT POST ON AN ACTING BASIS
49ac0409 THAT MADE MR. ZHAO A PROTEGE OF DENG XIAOPING THE DE FACTO HEAD OF THE PARTY AS WELL AS THE GOVERNMENT
49ac040a IT IS A DELICATE POSITION REQUIRING HIM TO MANEUVER AMONG VARIOUS INTEREST GROUPS AND PERSONAL CLIQUES THAT MAKE UP CHINA'S TOP LEADERSHIP
49ac040b SOME HAVE CHARACTERIZED OUR COUNTERMEASURES AS PROTECTIONIST BROUGHT ABOUT BECAUSE OF CONGRESSIONAL PRESSURES
49ac040c THAT IS DEAD WRONG
49ac040d WE HAVE BEEN IN CONSULTATIONS WITH JAPAN ON THIS ISSUE SINCE NOVEMBER LONG BEFORE PRESENT TRADE LEGISLATION WAS INTRODUCED
49ac040e THE PRESIDENT'S ACTION WAS THE CULMINATION OF THAT PROCESS AND IT HAD NOTHING WHATSOEVER TO DO WITH TRADE BILLS
49ac040f PRESIDENT REAGAN BELIEVES THAT PEOPLE AND NATIONS SHOULD HONOR THEIR OBLIGATIONS
49ac040g THERE IS NOTHING PROTECTIONIST ABOUT THAT
49ac040h THE ONE HUNDRED SHARE INDEX CLOSED TEN POINT SIX POINTS HIGHER AT TWENTY TWO SEVENTY ONE POINT EIGHT
49ac040i THE FINANCIAL TIMES THIRTY SHARE INDEX ROSE ELEVEN POINT SIX TO SEVENTEEN SEVENTY FIVE POINT FOUR
49ac040j THE GOLD MINES INDEX FELL THREE POINT FIVE TO FOUR FORTY NINE POINT FIVE
49ac040k VOLUME WAS LIGHT AT FOUR FIFTY FOUR POINT SIX MILLION SHARES COMPARED WITH SEVEN FIFTY ONE POINT FOUR MILLION FRIDAY
49ac040l THE CLEAREST INDICATION OF JAPAN'S BIOTECHNOLOGY AMBITIONS MAY BE THE ATTENTION BEING GIVEN THE FIELD BY THE MINISTRY OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND INDUSTRY
49ac040m WHEN M. I. T. I. GETS INVOLVED IT'S A SAFE BET THE NATION'S SENIOR STRATEGISTS HAVE TARGETED AN INDUSTRY FOR A BIG PUSH
49ac040n THOUGH M. I. T. I. DOES SOME BIOTECH RESEARCH ITS MAIN ROLE IS TO SPUR AND GUIDE WORK BY OTHERS
49ac040o LIKE A FISHING BOAT TOSSING CHUM IN THE WATER IT FIRST CHARTS A COURSE AND THEN PLANTS MONEY TO ATTRACT MORE
49ac040p JAMES MAHONEY MR. CARSON'S SPOKESMAN SAYS THE SPLIT WITH MR. BUSHKIN OCCURRED AFTER MR. CARSON DECIDED TO SELL HIS TELEVISION PRODUCTION BUSINESS
49ac040q <NOISE> THERE AREN'T ANY FINANCIAL IRREGULARITIES HE SAYS
49ac040r THEY DIFFERED ON THE MANNER IN WHICH HIS COMPANIES WERE BEING SOLD
49ac040s MR. CARSON IS SAID TO HAVE DECIDED TO SELL CARSON PRODUCTIONS PIECEMEAL INSTEAD OF AS A GOING CONCERN
49ac040t MR. BUSHKIN REPORTEDLY FAVORED KEEPING THE COMPANY WHOLE RATHER THAN AUCTIONING INDIVIDUAL ASSETS
49ac040u FRESH FACES APPEAR AT THE RAINBOW KITCHEN ALMOST DAILY AMONG THEM A YOUNG COUPLE BACK FROM A DISILLUSIONING JOB HUNTING SOJOURN TO THE SUN BELT
49ac040v THEY EXPECT TO BE ON THEIR FEET IN A MONTH
49ac040w OTHERS SHOW UP BETWEEN ODD JOBS OR IN THE SUMMER WHEN THEIR CHILDREN CAN'T GET FREE LUNCH AT SCHOOL
49ac040x HE SCORED A BIG TRIUMPH EARLY THIS YEAR PUSHING ASIDE LOCAL BUREAUCRATS WHO WANTED TO SHARE HIS SPOILS IN A ONE BILLION DOLLAR FREEWAY BEING BUILT IN GUANGDONG PROVINCE
49ac040y HIS WEAPON THE PERSONAL BLESSING OF COMMUNIST PARTY GENERAL SECRETARY ZHAO ZIYANG
49ac040z AT THE APRIL OPENING OF A FIVE HUNDRED TWELVE POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR GUANGDONG POWER PLANT OFFICIALDOM HEAPED PRAISE ON MR. WU FOR BEATING A CONSTRUCTION DEADLINE
49ac0410 INDONESIA AND THE PHILIPPINES ARE SO IMPRESSED THAT THEY HAVE ASKED HIM TO BUILD SIMILAR PLANTS
49ac0411 MANY ADMIRERS BELIEVE FIRMLY THAT IF ANYONE CAN GET BUSINESS DONE IN CHINA MR. WU CAN
49ac0412 TAEKWONDO LOOKS KIND OF LIKE KARATE SO I ASKED A KOREAN OFFICIAL FOR AN EXPLANATION OF THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO SPORTS
49ac0413 TAEKWONDO IS KOREAN
49ac0414 KARATE IS JAPANESE HE SNAPPED AND TURNED AWAY
49ac0415 MR. PAPAGEORGE SAID THESE WERE CONCEPTUAL NEGOTIATIONS
49ac0416 IDEAS WERE FLOWING
49ac0417 WE WERE SEEING WHAT WORKED FOR EACH OF US
49ac0418 THE TWO OF US WERE TRYING TO THINK OF A WAY TO SATISFY EVERYONE
49ac0419 BUT IT'S WHAT THIS ELECTION IS ALL ABOUT
49ac041a THE REAL QUESTION ON THE BALLOT IS SHOULD THE REAGAN YEARS CONTINUE BEYOND THE REAGAN YEARS
49ac041b BEYOND THE BUSH YEARS
49ac041c BEYOND EVEN THE QUAYLE YEARS
49ac041d THE SUPREME COURT WILL DETERMINE THAT AND THE NEXT PRESIDENT WILL DETERMINE THE COURT'S MAKEUP FOR AT LEAST ANOTHER GENERATION
49ac041e WARNER LAMBERT AND SCHERING PLOUGH ARE COVETED FOR THEIR OVER THE COUNTER DRUGS AS WELL AS FOR PRESCRIPTION SALES
49ac041f OVER THE COUNTER DRUGS SUCH AS WARNER LAMBERT'S LISTERINE MOUTHWASH ARE THOUGHT TO HAVE FRANCHISE VALUE
49ac041g THEY AREN'T RESEARCH INTENSIVE THEY'RE MARKETING INTENSIVE ONE ANALYST SAID
49bc0201 <NOISE> THE SALE OF THE HOTELS IS PART OF HOLIDAY'S STRATEGY TO SELL OFF ASSETS AND CONCENTRATE ON PROPERTY MANAGEMENT
49bc0202 THE HOTEL OPERATOR'S EMBASSY SUITES HOTELS INCORPORATED SUBSIDIARY <NOISE> WILL CONTINUE TO MANAGE THE PROPERTIES <NOISE>
49bc0203 LONG TERM MANAGEMENT CONTRACTS ALLOW US TO GENERATE INCOME ON A SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER CAPITAL BASE <NOISE> SAID MICHAEL D. ROSE HOLIDAY'S CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
49bc0204 <NOISE> ALBERT HALPRIN CHIEF OF THE F. C. C.'S COMMON CARRIER BUREAU SAID HE HADN'T SEEN THE CONSUMER GROUP'S STUDY <NOISE>
49bc0205 HE SAID PREVIOUS STUDIES BY THE GROUP HAD FOCUSED ON FLAT RATE SERVICE FOR LOCAL CALLS
49bc0206 MR. HALPRIN CONCEDED THAT SUCH RATES HAD RISEN SHARPLY BUT HE ADDED THAT PHONE COMPANIES NOW OFFER A VARIETY OF LOCAL TELEPHONE PLANS AT DIFFERING PRICES <NOISE>
49bc0207 AROUND THAT TIME MR. GENGER ALSO MET WITH MR. EL SAYED
49bc0208 HE SURFACED TO MEET WITH GENGER AFTER GENGER HAD MADE THE APPROACH TO THE COMPANY SAID MR. TROTMAN THE DREXEL BURNHAM BANKER
49bc0209 I THINK HE WAS TRYING TO FIND A WAY BACK IN
49bc020a BUT MR. TROTMAN SAID MR. EL SAYED ISN'T INVOLVED IN THE TRANS RESOURCES BID <NOISE>
49bc020b INSTEAD MR. REAGAN AGREED TO LOWER THE VOLUME OF HIS COMMENTS SUPPORTING THE CONTRAS AND CRITICIZING THE DEMOCRATIC CONTROLLED <NOISE> CONGRESS
49bc020c HE ALSO WOULD HOLD OFF ON ANY NEW PROPOSALS FOR CONTRA MILITARY AID UNTIL SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH
49bc020d IF THE SANDINISTA GOVERNMENT HAD MADE SIGNIFICANT DEMOCRATIC REFORMS AND A CEASEFIRE WAS IN PLACE MR. REAGAN WOULD END HIS CONTRA MILITARY AID PROGRAM
49bc020e <NOISE> IN KOREA LABOR CONFLICTS HAVE ADDED HEAT TO THE UNSTABLE POLITICAL SITUATION
49bc020f THE NEW UNIONS ARE GROWING MORE ADVERSARIAL
49bc020g COMPANIES KEEP ASKING THE GOVERNMENT TO SMASH THE UNIONS
49bc020h BUT THE RULING PARTY CAN'T RISK ALIENATING WORKERS WHO WILL VOTE IN THE COMING ELECTIONS
49bc020i IT REFUSES SO FAR TO BACKTRACK ON ITS JULY FIRST PROMISE OF GREATER DEMOCRACY OR TO RETURN TO THE POLICY OF OVERT UNION BUSTING
49bc020j IN A NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT SEVENTY NINE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING <NOISE> THE S. E. C.'S ENFORCEMENT DIVISION PRESSED FOR MR. KOBRIN'S PERMANENT EXPULSION FROM THE SECURITIES BUSINESS
49bc020k THE DIVISION ARGUED THAT STOCK MANIPULATION OF THE KIND HE HAD BEEN ENGAGED IN WENT TO THE HEART OF THE SECURITIES LAWS
49bc020l THE DIVISION ALSO SAID THE LAW DIRECTED THE S. E. C. TO ACT ON THE BELIEF THAT PAST MISCONDUCT RAISED A RISK OF FUTURE MISCONDUCT <NOISE> THAT MIGHT JUSTIFY EXPULSION
49bc020m CERTAINLY FOREIGN COMPETITION AND A CHANGING WORLD ECONOMY HAVE EXACTED A HEAVY TOLL ON OUR NATION'S MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES
49bc020n HOWEVER MANY OF THESE INDUSTRIES HAVE SURVIVED AND ARE NOW AS TOUGH AND LEAN AS THEY'VE EVER BEEN
49bc020o THE MANAGERS OF THESE COMPANIES HAVE LEARNED THROUGH HARD EXPERIENCE ABOUT EXACTLY WHICH INVESTMENTS PAY OFF
49bc020p ALTHOUGH AIRLINES DENY HANDLING COMPLAINTS DIFFERENTLY THEY MAKE NO APOLOGIES ABOUT FAVORING FREQUENT FLIERS IN OTHER WAYS <NOISE>
49bc020q <NOISE> THEY SAY THEY ARE ONLY TRYING TO BOOST MEMBERSHIP IN THESE PROGRAMS WHICH AIRLINES CONSIDER CRUCIAL FOR DEVELOPING BRAND LOYALTY
49bc020r THESE ARE OUR MOST IMPORTANT CUSTOMERS SAYS A UNITED SPOKESMAN
49bc020s <NOISE> MR. ANTONIU'S FALL AND SURPRISING REBOUND PROVE THERE IS LIFE AFTER INSIDER TRADING
49bc020t BUT HIS STORY ALSO SUGGESTS THAT SOME CHARACTER TRAITS THAT MAY GIVE RISE TO INSIDER TRADING CAN BE HARD TO CHANGE
49bc020u INSIDER TRADING IS A FORM OF FRAUD AND SOME SPORT ABOUT FRANCHISES NOW CLAIM THEY HAVE BEEN DEFRAUDED BY MR. ANTONIU
49bc020v STILL TRADERS WERE ENCOURAGED BY INVESTOR REACTION TO THIS WEEK'S TREASURY FINANCING ESPECIALLY YESTERDAY'S THIRTY YEAR BOND SALE
49bc020w WE THOUGHT THERE WAS VERY BROAD JAPANESE PARTICIPATION IN THE BOND AUCTION SAID MR. LAKEFIELD OF SHEARSON LEHMAN <NOISE>
49bc020x BUT THE REAL QUESTION IS WHETHER THE JAPANESE BOUGHT FOR SHORT TERM TRADING ACCOUNTS OR FOR LONG TERM INVESTMENT
49bc020y INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS LOOKING FOR SOME EXCITEMENT IN THEIR LIVES AREN'T LIKELY TO BE ENTHRALLED BY MR. BERG'S ADVICE
49bc020z HE SUGGESTS THAT THEY DROP THEIR HARD EARNED DOLLARS INTO THE MOST CONSERVATIVE OF INVESTMENTS T. BILLS AND SIT TIGHT <NOISE>
49bc0210 THERE'S NO SENSE TRYING TO PLAY GAMES WITH THIS MARKET MR. BERG EXPLAINS
49bc0211 THINGS ARE A BIT DULLER THIS YEAR
49bc0212 MR. BILZERIAN HAS SENT HIS BOY TO A LITTLE LEAGUE TEAM IN FARAWAY MINNESOTA WHERE THE FAMILY SPENDS ITS SUMMERS AND ISN'T COACHING A TEAM THIS YEAR
49bc0213 ALL THE ACTION APPARENTLY WILL BE IN THE COURTROOM
49bc0214 THE GRAND METROPOLITAN OPERATIONS WHICH WERE ACQUIRED BY THAT COMPANY IN NINETEEN EIGHTY HAVE ENJOYED A GOOD REPUTATION IN THE INDUSTRY
49bc0215 BUT PEPSICO FEELS ITS TERRITORIES CAN BE BETTER EXPLOITED DUE TO THEIR PROXIMITY TO EXISITING COMPANY OWNED BOTTLERS
49bc0216 IT OWNS ITS LOS ANGELES AND SAN FRANCISCO BOTTLERS FOR INSTANCE MAKING THE CENTRAL CALIFORNIA TERRITORY A GOOD FIT <NOISE>
49bc0217 IT ALSO ALREADY OWNS ITS BOTTLERS IN CENTRAL AND NORTHERN FLORIDA AND PARTS OF GEORGIA
49bc0218 <NOISE> THERE ARE SOME GREAT OPPORTUNITIES TO MAXIMIZE PRODUCTION AND MARKETING EFFICIENCIES THE PEPSICO SPOKESMAN SAID
49bc0219 PETER DAPUZZO HEAD OF RETAIL TRADING AT SHEARSON LEHMAN HUTTON <NOISE> ALSO LOOKS FOR A SHARP UPWARD MOVE IN STOCK PRICES GIVEN A FEW IFS
49bc021a ONE IS IF INVESTORS DON'T GET SPOOKED AT THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE CRASH
49bc021b ANOTHER IS IF THE FEDERAL RESERVE EASES INTEREST RATES
49bc021c <NOISE> AND A THIRD IS IF GEORGE BUSH WINS THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION
49bc021d <NOISE> BUT SERVICE MERCHANDISE JUMPED ONE AND THREE EIGHTHS TO EIGHTEEN AND A AND A QUARTER ON ONE POINT FOUR MILLION SHARES
49bc021e THE STOCK SLID TO TWELVE AND A QUARTER IN SEPTEMBER AFTER THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT AN INVESTOR GROUP HAD DECIDED NOT TO PROCEED WITH A POSSIBLE ACQUISITION OFFER

49bc0305 THE FIRM A UNIT OF PAINEWEBBER GROUP INCORPORATED RELEASED A SHORT STATEMENT YESTERDAY IN WHICH IT SAID THE TWO MEN HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED INDEFINITELY
49bc0306 THE FIRM HAS COOPERATED WITH THE U. S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE THROUGHOUT THE INVESTIGATION AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO
49bc0307 THEN THERE ARE UTILITY STOCKS
49bc0308 THE NASDAQ UTILITY INDEX JUMPED EIGHTEEN PERCENT IN THE FIRST QUARTER WHILE INDEXES OF LISTED UTILITY STOCKS ROSE BARELY THREE PERCENT
49bc0309 BUT IN FACT MOST OF THE FIFTY FIVE ELECTRIC GAS AND WATER UTILITY STOCKS ON NASDAQ PERFORMED MUCH LIKE THEIR COUNTERPARTS ON THE MAJOR EXCHANGES
49bc030a PRODUCERS HOWEVER SAY THE GUILD DEMAND REALLY REPRESENTS AN EFFORT TO SQUEEZE IN MORE THAN ONE SESSION A DAY
49bc030b THE ACTORS ARE PAID BY THE SESSION NOT BY THE HOUR AND BOTH SIDES AGREE THAT SESSIONS RARELY EXCEED THREE HOURS
49bc030c <NOISE> AND WITH THE GUILD CHOOSING SUCH A CRITICAL TIME FOR THE STRIKE T. V. PRODUCTION OFFICIALS ARE ESPECIALLY IRATE <NOISE>
49bc030d WHEN MY FAMILY FLED WE LEFT MY NANNY IN CHARGE OF THE HOUSE

49bc030s MR. KOVACS AN OCTOGENARIAN WHO CROONS LOVE BALLADS TO ANYONE WHO WILL LISTEN COMES FOR CAMARADERIE
49bc030t FOR GEORGE A MIDDLE AGED RETARDED MAN THE KITCHEN IS A LIFELINE
49bc030u HE ARRIVED FIVE YEARS AGO PICKED UP A BROOM AND WITHOUT SAYING A WORD STARTED CLEANING UP HE NOW GETS PAID THE MINIMUM WAGE
49bc030v THE OFFER IS A BRILLIANT DEFENSE CONTRIVED BY SANTA FE'S INVESTMENT BANKERS AT SALOMON BROTHERS AND GOLDMAN SACHS
49bc030w THE SIXTY THREE DOLLAR A SHARE PRICE WILL HANG OVER THE NEGOTIATIONS LIKE SMOG OVER LOS ANGELES
49bc030x AND THOUGH MR. DINGMAN WILL OFFER PACKAGE AFTER PACKAGE THAT SEEMS TO ADD UP TO SIXTY THREE DOLLARS HE DOESN'T REALLY PLAN TO MEET THE ASKING PRICE
49bc030y INSTEAD HE HOPES TO PERSUADE SANTA FE TO TAKE LESS
49bc030z FOR ONE HUNDRED YEARS WYOMING HAS BEEN RIDING A ROLLER COASTER
49bc0310 WHEN COMMODITY PRICES RISE PEOPLE RUSH TO WYOMING FOR SHORT TERM WORK AT BOOM TOWN PAY
49bc0311 <NOISE> GOVERNMENT REVENUES LARGELY UNDERWRITTEN BY ENERGY COMPANY TAXES EXPLODE
49bc0312 <NOISE> WHEN COMMODITY PRICES SOUR PEOPLE PULL OUT OFTEN WITH THEIR MOBILE HOMES TRAILING BEHIND
49bc0313 AND REVENUES SLUMP
49bc0314 THE REASON FOR THE RELATIVELY MODEST INCENTIVE PROGRAMS IS THAT THE AUTO MAKERS ARE DEMONSTRATING A MUCH BETTER ABILITY TO KEEP PRODUCTION IN LINE WITH SALES
49bc0315 <NOISE> INVENTORIES OF U. S. MADE CARS STOOD AT FIFTY NINE DAYS SUPPLY AT THE END OF AUGUST ACCORDING TO WARD'S AUTOMOTIVE REPORTS AN INDUSTRY TRADE PUBLICATION
49bc0316 THAT IS CONSIDERED A NORMAL SUPPLY AND IT IS THE LOWEST STOCK IN TWENTY TWO MONTHS

49bc031a IN HOUSTON A COASTAL SPOKESMAN SAID THE FIGHT ISN'T OVER
49bc031b WE ANTICIPATE ASKING FOR A REHEARING OR APPEALING TO THE SUPREME COURT THE SPOKESMAN SAID
49bc031c HE ADDED WE WERE QUITE SURPRISED BY THE REVERSAL
49bc031d WE THOUGHT WE HAD A SOLID CASE
49bc0401 <NOISE> I'VE BEEN TRYING TO LIVE MY LIFE BY AN IDEA SHE SAYS POINTING TO A VIDEO GAME
49bc0402 SEE THAT MACHINE <NOISE>
49bc0403 THAT'S AN IDEA
49bc0404 ROCK AND ROLL

49bc040e <NOISE> SELECTED ISSUES ENDED OFF THEIR INTRADAY LOWS THOUGH AFTER WALL STREET'S LOWER OPENING PROVED LESS SEVERE THAN SOME DUTCH FORECASTERS ANTICIPATED DEALERS SAID <NOISE>
49bc040f VOLATILE TRADING THROUGHOUT THE SESSION PRODUCED WIDE PRICE FLUCTUATIONS AS DUTCH INSTITUTIONS BARGAIN HUNTED WHILE OVERSEAS INVESTORS TENDED TO SELL SHARES
49bc040g RATES ARE DETERMINED BY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PURCHASE PRICE AND FACE VALUE
49bc040h THUS HIGHER BIDDING NARROWS THE INVESTOR'S RETURN WHILE LOWER BIDDING WIDENS IT <NOISE>
49bc040i THE PERCENTAGE RATES ARE CALCULATED ON A THREE HUNDRED SIXTY DAY YEAR WHILE THE COUPON EQUIVALENT YIELD IS BASED ON A THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE DAY YEAR
49bc040j TECHNICALLY THE STOPGAP BILL WILL LEAVE THE GOVERNMENT OUT OF MONEY OVER THE WEEKEND
49bc040k BUT THAT SHOULD HAVE LITTLE PRACTICAL EFFECT SINCE MOST OPERATIONS WILL BE CLOSED DURING THAT TIME
49bc040l <NOISE> <NOISE> CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS HOPE HOWEVER IT WILL PRESSURE LAWMAKERS TO FINISH THEIR WORK BEFORE MONDAY
49bc040m SOME MONTHS BEFORE THE CRASH INTEREST RATES STARTED TO MOVE UP

49bc040o THE MONEY SUPPLY GROWTH WAS MUDDLING AT OR BELOW THE LOWER END OF THE TARGET RANGE A PHENOMENON WE HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED FOR MANY YEARS
49bc040p FOR A SHIP OR MISSILE GUIDED BY THE WRONG TIME SIGNAL THAT LITTLE GAP COULD MEAN ARRIVING AT THE WRONG DESTINATION
49bc040q IF WE LET THE DIFFERENCE GROW SAYS MR. MCCARTHY WE COULD RUN INTO PROBLEMS OVER THOUSANDS OF YEARS
49bc040r IT MIGHT BE NOON BY ATOMIC TIME BUT DARK OUTSIDE
49bc040s THIS HEADY MIXTURE OF PIETY AND GUTTER FIGHTING WE FEAR IS LIKELY TO DETRACT FROM CAUSES WE WOULD LIKE TO ADVANCE
49bc040t THIS IS PERFECTLY ILLUSTRATED BY MR. ROBERTSON'S CHARGE THAT THERE ARE RUSSIAN INTERMEDIATE RANGE MISSILES IN CUBA
49bc040u IT IS PERFECTLY TRUE THAT THE I. N. F. TREATY GIVES US NO RIGHTS TO INSPECT FOR MISSILES IN THE SOVIET'S ISLAND SATELLITE
49bc040v AND IT IS TRUE THAT SOVIET BASES THERE ARE A DANGER TO THE U. S.
49bc040w BUT TO POSE THESE VALID ISSUES IN THE MOST INFLAMMATORY WAY MR. ROBERTSON HAS CHARGED THAT THE MISSILES ARE ALREADY DEPLOYED AND IN PLACE
49bc040x IF THIS IS PRESENTED AS THE ISSUE THE ANSWER IS NO AND THE VALID POINTS ARE LOST
49bc040y KAISER'S PRESENT VALUE IS EQUALLY UNCERTAIN THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT ITS NET WORTH IS AT LEAST A NEGATIVE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS
49bc040z IN ITS LAWSUITS AGAINST FORMER MANAGEMENT THE COMPANY IS SEEKING DAMAGES OF MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR ALLEGED SELF DEALING AND MISMANAGEMENT
49bc0410 IN THE PROCESS THE SUITS ALLEGE ASSETS WERE OVERSTATED AND LIABILITIES UNDERSTATED
49bc0411 THE SHORTAGE OF WESTERN CAPACITY MAKES SOVIET LAUNCHERS ATTRACTIVE
49bc0412 A SERIES OF LAUNCH DISASTERS INCLUDING THE CHALLENGER EXPLOSION SEVERELY CURTAILED WESTERN ACCESS TO SPACE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX TO EIGHTY SEVEN
49bc0413 THE EUROPEAN ARIANE LAUNCHER JUST RETURNED TO COMMERCIAL SERVICE
49bc0414 THE U. S. SPACE PROGRAM WILL NOT ELIMINATE ITS BACKLOG OF PAYLOADS UNTIL THE EARLY NINETEEN NINETIES

49bc0417 HE'S NOT ALONE <NOISE>
49bc0418 CARBIDE'S SABOTAGE THEORY IS WEAKENED PARTLY BECAUSE IT HASN'T DISCLOSED ALL ITS EVIDENCE
49bc0419 THOUGH ITS ATTORNEYS SAY THEY HAVE INTERVIEWED THE ALLEGED SABOTEUR <NOISE> EXTENSIVELY THEY WON'T DISCLOSE HIS NAME OR WHEREABOUTS OR DESCRIBE HIM
49bc041a THEY ALSO DECLINE TO SAY WHETHER THEY UNDERSTAND HIS MOTIVES OR HAVE ANY WITNESSES
49bc041b THE ONE ELEMENT OF SUSPENSE REMAINS THE SELECTION OF A RUNNING MATE FOR VICE PRESIDENT BUSH'S PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN
49bc041c BUSH MANAGERS INSIST THEY WON'T DISCLOSE THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE'S IDENTITY UNTIL THURSDAY MORNING
49bc041d REAGAN ARRIVED AT THE CONVENTION SITE LAST NIGHT AND PREPARED FOR HIS FAREWELL SPEECH TO THE PARTY TONIGHT
49bc041e THE PRESIDENT LEAVES FOR CALIFORNIA TOMORROW AND BUSH WILL ARRIVE TO TAKE CONTROL OF THE CONVENTION
49bc041f IT IS A CRUCIAL TIME IN WHICH BUSH MUST ATTEMPT TO MOVE OUT FROM UNDER REAGAN'S SHADOW AND ESTABLISH HIS OWN IDENTITY
49cc0201 PHIL WALTERS WHOSE BACK YARD WOULD HAVE FACED THE PROPOSED SHELTER SAYS HE WENT TO MEETINGS TO LEARN BOTH SIDES OF THE SHELTER DEBATE
49cc0202 BUT JUST FOR WANTING TO HEAR THE PROS AND CONS I BECAME A PRO DERELICT REVOLUTIONARY IN THE EYES OF SOME PEOPLE HE RECALLS
49cc0203 THEY DIDN'T WANT AN OBJECTIVE STUDY
49cc0204 THEY JUST WANTED TO PREVENT THE ONSLAUGHT OF THE BUMS

49cc0209 IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SOME GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES C. I. A. HAD TO GIVE UP FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS
49cc020a NOW IT IS SUGGESTED THAT OFFICIALS GAVE UP FIFTH AMENDMENT RIGHTS
49cc020b IN NINETEEN NINETY SOMEONE IS GOING TO SUGGEST THAT GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS GIVE UP THEIR FOURTH AMENDMENT RIGHTS PROTECTING THEM FROM UNLAWFUL SEARCHES
49cc020c WHY NOT
49cc020d THEY MAY BE HIDING IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS IN THEIR HOMES
49cc020e CABLE OPERATORS ARE WILLING PARTICIPANTS IN THE PRICE CUTTING PROGRAMS
49cc020f FOR ONE THING BECAUSE OF DEREGULATION WHICH I- TOOK EFFECT JANUARY FIRST THE OPERATORS HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO RAISE RATES FOR BASIC CABLE SERVICE
49cc020g IN ADDITION THE PAY NETWORKS ARE CUTTING THE PRICES THEY CHARGE OPERATORS
49cc020h CONGRESS GAVE THE SPACE AGENCY'S PLAN MIXED REVIEWS
49cc020i REPRESENTATIVE BILL LOWERY REPUBLICAN CALIFORNIA WHO HAS BEEN OUTSPOKEN ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF SECURING A SECOND BOOSTER ROCKET SUPPLIER PRAISED THE PLAN

49cc020l AMOCO'S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHOW IT HAD FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN CASH AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES ON HAND AT THE CLOSE OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
49cc020m IN RECENT TALKS WITH ANALYSTS AMOCO OFFICIALS HAVE SAID THE COMPANY IS WELL POSITIONED FINANCIALLY IF IT DECIDES TO MAKE AN ACQUISITION
49cc020n MOREOVER A WESTERN FIRM HAS TO MAKE SOME CALCULATION OF WHETHER MR. GORBACHEV WILL SUCCEED IN HIS EFFORTS TO ACTIVATE THE SOVIET WORK FORCE
49cc020o PAST EXPERIENCE AND CURRENT REPORTS INDICATE THAT HIS CHANCES AREN'T GOOD
49cc020p ROWLAND EVANS AND ROBERT NOVAK REPORTED FROM MOSCOW LAST WEEK THAT PARTY APPARATCHIKS AND DISAFFECTED SOVIET WORKERS ALREADY ARE UNDERMINING REFORMS
49cc020q THE GOVERNMENT FACES A KNOTTY SURPLUS PROBLEM

49cc020u HUMANA TRIED TO DEFEND ITSELF THROUGH DIVERSIFICATION AS DID THE OTHER LARGE CHAINS HOSPITAL CORPORATION OF AMERICA AMERICAN MEDICAL INTERNATIONAL *INCORPORATED* AND NATIONAL MEDICAL ENTERPRISES *INCORPORATED*
49cc020v THE IDEA WAS THAT IF A HOSPITAL OWNER ALSO HAD AN INSURANCE PLAN IT COULD STEER *PATIENTS* TO ITS INSTITUTIONS THROUGH FINANCIAL INCENTIVES
49cc020w THE PATIENT POOL MIGHT SHRINK BUT THE COMPANY COULD GRAB A BIGGER PART OF IT
49cc020x KEMP'S CAMPAIGN TAKES ON AN INCREASINGLY DESPERATE TONE
49cc020y IN ONE SURE SIGN OF A CANDIDACY IN TROUBLE HE LASHES OUT AT CRITICISM FROM A LIGHTLY REGARDED T. V. COMMENTATOR
49cc020z EVEN SOME SUPPORTERS NOW SAY PRIVATELY THAT HE SHOULD AIM FOR THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION
49cc0210 BUT HIS LONGTIME HOSTILITIES WITH DOLE LEAVE A SPOT ON A BUSH TICKET AS ABOUT THE ONLY POSSIBILITY
49cc0211 WE NEVER HAD ONE BEFORE MR. TIMBERS SAID
49cc0212 A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF OUR CLIENTS WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THAT OPTION
49cc0213 IT'S NOT NECESSARILY A MARKET CALL
49cc0214 MR. TIMBERS SAYS HE'S FAIRLY AMBIVALENT ABOUT THE PRICE OF GOLD NEAR TERM
49cc0215 HE DOES SEE HOWEVER HIGHER INFLATION OF FIVE PERCENT OR SO IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE UP FROM FOUR PERCENT THIS YEAR
49cc0216 A GOLD OPTION COULD BE A NICE ALTERNATIVE FOR FIXED INCOME INVESTORS SHOULD INFLATION FEARS ARISE MR. TIMBERS SAYS
49cc0217 BUT HE WARNS THAT COMPANIES SHOULD ASK HOW MUCH STOCK IS TOO MUCH
49cc0218 A DIRECTOR HOLDING A LARGE BLOCK MAY BECOME MORE INTERESTED IN SHORT TERM RESULTS THAN LONG TERM CORPORATE HEALTH

49cc030v ANALYSTS SAID TRADERS ARE SHIFTING THEIR EMPHASIS AWAY FROM LAST YEAR'S CROP AND TO THIS YEAR'S
49cc030w WITH THIS YEAR'S SMALL ACREAGE INCREASES WEATHER AND SPRING PLANTING CONDITIONS ARE MAJOR CONCERNS TO A MARKET THAT IS BEGINNING TO SHAKE OFF A HUGE SURPLUS

49cc0402 THE ESTIMATE IS BASED ON AN INCREASE OF OUTPUT OF ONE POINT FOUR PERCENT AND AN INCREASE IN HOURS WORKED OF ONE POINT ONE PERCENT
49cc0403 THIS WAS THE FIRST QUARTER IN WHICH PRODUCTIVITY INCREASED IN THE NONFINANCIAL SECTOR SINCE THE THIRD QUARTER OF NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE
49cc0404 IN RECENT YEARS HOWEVER INSIDER TRADING CASES HAVE SOMETIMES INVOLVED PEOPLE WHO ARE QUITE REMOTE FROM COMPANIES THAT ARE THE SUBJECT OF INSIDE INFORMATION

49cc040p THAT TEST WAS LESS THAN A COMPLETE SUCCESS
49cc040q DIRT THAT ACCUMULATED IN THE KENAF DURING HARVESTING WASN'T ALL REMOVED AND ENDED UP IN THE PAPER
49cc040r THE KENAF ALSO JAMMED IN SOME EQUIPMENT BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN CUT IN LENGTHS THAT WERE SEVERAL FEET LONG

49cc0416 BROKERS AT MERRILL LYNCH REALTY RECALL A SALE THAT WAS DELAYED FOR A MONTH BY A ONE MILLION DOLLAR INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE LIEN ON THE PROPERTY
49cc0417 ANOTHER SALE WAS DELAYED WHEN THE LENDER DISCOVERED THAT THE OWNER HAD DIED BETWEEN THE TIME THE PROPERTY WAS POSTED FOR FORECLOSURE AND THE FORECLOSURE WAS COMPLETED
49cc0418 WE WERE AT THE CLOSING TABLE WHEN THIS ALL CAME OUT SAYS WANDA HUTCHINS THE MERRILL LYNCH AGENT
49cc0419 INVALID FORECLOSURES ARE ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS WE HAVE
49cc041a THE LOWER VOLATILITY COULD BE ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW WHEN THE COURSE OF INTEREST RATES SEEMS ESPECIALLY CLOUDY
49cc041b WHILE INTEREST RATES HAVE BEEN DECLINING RECENTLY MANY ECONOMISTS EXPECT RATES TO RISE BY YEAR END
49cc041c AFTER THAT HOWEVER THEY SAY RATES COULD FALL AGAIN PERHAPS SHARPLY AS ECONOMIC GROWTH SLOWS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE
49cc041d THE MOST WIDELY USED ESTROGEN PRODUCT IN THE U. S. IS SOLD UNDER THE BRAND NAME PREMARIN BY AMERICAN HOME PRODUCTS CORPORATION'S WYETH AYERST LABORATORIES
49cc041e IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT SALES OF PREMARIN LARGELY TO PREVENT OSTEOPOROSIS JUMPED TWENTY SIX PERCENT TO TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS
49cc041f A SPOKESWOMAN FOR THE COMPANY SAID PREMARIN ISN'T CURRENTLY INDICATED FOR USE IN PREVENTING HEART DISEASE BUT THE COMPANY IS RESEARCHING THE MATTER
49dc0201 THE ACCORD MOST LIKELY WOULD INCLUDE SOME PRIVATE AGREEMENT AMONG MINISTERS ON HOW FAR UP OR DOWN THESE RATES CAN MOVE AND STILL BE ACCEPTABLE
49dc0202 BUT OFFICIALS SAID IT IS UNLIKELY THESE LIMITS WOULD BE MADE PUBLIC
49dc0203 <NOISE> AND IT ISN'T KNOWN YET WHETHER THE MAJOR POWERS WOULD PLEDGE TO INTERVENE IN CURRENCY MARKETS IF EXCHANGE RATES WERE TO EXCEED THOSE LIMITS
49dc0204 HOW IS WALL STREET REACTING TO THE CHANGES
49dc0205 SOME INVESTMENT BANKERS FEEL THREATENED BY IT OTHERS SCOFF AT SUGGESTION THAT THESE EFFORTS ARE TRULY COMPETITIVE
49dc0206 BUT SOME SAY THE CASE ISN'T CLEAR
49dc0207 FEW DEVELOPERS ARE BIG ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY THE COST OF THESE DIVISIONS
49dc0208 THE TEST WILL BE WHETHER THE NEW UNITS ARE ADDING VALUE TO THEIR ORGANIZATIONS
49dc0209 IF NOT ONE INVESTMENT BANKER SAYS THE PARTNERS WILL KILL THEM
49dc020a IN CLEVELAND HIGBEE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER ROBERT BROADBENT SAYS THE RETAILER HAS BENEFITED FROM ITS PARENT'S FINANCIAL EXPERTISE
49dc020b ALTHOUGH IT WILL RETAIN CONTROL INDUSTRIAL EQUITY IS PLANNING TO TAKE HIGBEE PUBLIC AGAIN PROBABLY IN JUNE
49dc020c MEANWHILE SAYS MR. BROADBENT THEY'VE MADE US MORE INQUISITIVE ABOUT ACQUISITIONS OURSELVES
49dc020d DESPITE WORRIES ABOUT INVESTMENT BANKERS LENDING MONEY FOR BUYOUTS MORGAN STANLEY DID BETTER THAN OWENS ILLINOIS' PUBLIC BONDHOLDERS WILL DO
49dc020e ANNUALIZED IT EARNS EIGHTY PERCENT PRE TAX ON ITS THREE MONTH THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR LOAN TO OWENS ILLINOIS MR. NIEHAUS SAYS
49dc020f THAT INCLUDES INTEREST OF TEN MILLION DOLLARS AND INVESTMENT BANKING FEES OF FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS
49dc020g THIRTEEN YEARS AGO MR. SMITH WAS MIRED IN PERSONAL BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS
49dc020h NOW HE LIVES LIKE A SUCCESSFUL CORPORATE EXECUTIVE
49dc020i BUT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE
49dc020j HIS IS A TAX EXEMPT NOT FOR PROFIT CORPORATION DEDICATED TO HELPING MINORS THE SICK AND THE NEEDY
49dc020k IT ALSO HAS GREATLY HELPED THE SMITH FAMILY
49dc020l LAST YEAR THE CORPORATION PAID THE SMITHS AND A SON IN LAW MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS IN SALARIES AND BONUSES
49dc020m MR. SMITH ALSO HAD AN OUTSTANDING UNSECURED PERSONAL LOAN OF A HUNDRED AND TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND ENJOYED OTHER PERQUISITES
49dc020n AS FOR THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS THAT AUTHORIZES ALL THIS WELL FOUR SMITHS HUSBAND WIFE AND TWO CHILDREN CURRENTLY ARE THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
49dc020o U. S. UTILITIES COULD ALSO INCREASE ORDERS OF FOREIGN URANIUM AHEAD OF ANY TOTAL IMPORT RESTRICTIONS ANALYSTS SAY
49dc020p URANIUM FROM SOUTH AFRICA FOR EXAMPLE HAS ALREADY FALLEN UNDER ANTI APARTHEID SANCTIONS
49dc020q BUT LAST YEAR SAID THE URANIUM INSTITUTE U. S. IMPORTS OF SOUTH AFRICAN URANIUM SURGED THREE HUNDRED PERCENT TO MORE THAN THIRTEEN POINT TWO MILLION POUNDS

49dc020t THE AGREEMENT IS A KEY PART OF ROBINS'S BANKRUPTCY REORGANIZATION PLAN
49dc020u <NOISE> ROBINS JUMPED ONE AND A HALF TO TWENTY ONE
49dc020v SOME CRITICS SEE THE GROWTH CONTROL MOVEMENT AS THE INDULGENCE OF A SELF SATISFIED MIDDLE CLASS
49dc020w AND SOME CHARGE THAT THERE ARE RACIST ROOTS
49dc020x THE FACT IS THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T LIKE SEEING HISPANICS AND ASIANS AROUND SAYS DANIEL GARCIA THE PRESIDENT OF THE LOS ANGELES PLANNING COMMISSION
49dc020y THE DIRT ROAD COMES TO A PAVED INTERSECTION AND MR. KGORI BEGINS A RIGHT TURN
49dc020z UP AHEAD HE SPOTS A ROADBLOCK WHERE A WHITE POLICEMAN WITH A DOG IS HOLDING UP THREE BLACKS TRAVELING ON A DONKEY PULLED WAGON
49dc0210 MR. KGORI DECIDES TO GO STRAIGHT ON THE DIRT ROAD EVEN THOUGH IT WILL TAKE HIM AN HOUR OUT OF HIS WAY
49dc0211 THAT WAS ILLUSTRATED BY A TEMPORARY SURGE IN SECURITIES LENDING DURING LAST OCTOBER'S CRASH AND A PREVIOUS SECURITIES SETTLEMENT BACKLOG IN BRITAIN
49dc0212 SAID ONE U. K. MONETARY OFFICIAL CLEARLY THERE WAS DEMAND IN THE MARKET FOR MORE EQUITIES MONEY BROKING
49dc0213 WHAT YOU ARE SEEING WITH SHEARSON'S MOVE IS A REFLECTION OF THAT DEMAND
49dc0214 SOME BANKING ANALYSTS DOUBT A LONDON OR TOKYO BANK WOULD MAKE A SIMILAR ACQUISITION ANYTIME HERE SOON
49dc0215 AMONG OTHER THINGS SOME FOREIGN BANKS HAVE BEEN SHYING AWAY FROM ACQUIRING ASSETS IN THE U. S. BECAUSE OF UNEXPECTEDLY HIGH EXPENSES MANAGING THEM FROM AFAR
49dc0216 INSTEAD THE TREND AMONG FOREIGN BANKS IS TO INCREASINGLY BUILD ALLIANCES WITH U. S. BANKS
49dc0217 HE RETURNED HOME IN TIME FOR HIS FIFTEENTH BIRTHDAY IN MARCH NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
49dc0218 AS PART OF THE TREATMENT HE ATTENDED FIFTEEN WEEKS OF AFTER CARE FIVE DAYS A WEEK
49dc0219 HE ALSO WAS REQUIRED TO GO TO NINETY MEETINGS OF ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS OR NARCOTICS ANONYMOUS IN NINETY DAYS
49dc021a HE DID SO WITH ENTHUSIASM HE DROPPED DRUG USING FRIENDS AND IT SEEMED OUR TROUBLES SOON WOULD BE BEHIND US
49dc021b THE INVESTORS SHOULD HAVE BEEN TOLD SAID PAUL BERNSTEIN AN ATTORNEY FOR ONE OF THE SHAREHOLDERS
49dc021c HE SAID THE ALLEGED OMISSIONS MAKE THE PROSPECTUS MISLEADING
49dc021d <NOISE> THE SUITS SEEK DAMAGES OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE OFFERING PRICE AND THE MARKET PRICE WHEN THE SUITS WERE FILED
49dc021e TO THE EXTENT THAT EXPORT GROWTH CONTINUES IT WILL KEEP THE U. S. ECONOMY FROM SLIPPING ADDED MR. WITTEN
49dc021f SO YOU CAN HAVE A SOFT LANDING SCENARIO BASED ON EXPANDING EXPORTS
49dc021g A SOFT LANDING COMBINES MODERATE ECONOMIC GROWTH WITH LOW INFLATION
49dc0301 PRICES MOVED UP IN RESPONSE TO NEWS THAT U. S. DURABLE GOODS ORDERS DECLINED SEVEN POINT FIVE PERCENT IN JANUARY
49dc0302 PRICES ALSO SLID AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE TOWER COMMISSION REPORT ON THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION'S INVOLVEMENT IN THE IRAN CONTRA AFFAIR
49dc0303 BUT BY LATE IN THE SESSION ISSUES HAD FIRMED AGAIN
49dc0304 MR. EPSTEIN SAID HE SET SOME VERY SHORT RANGE GOALS TO HELP PENRIL GET BACK INTO THE BLACK
49dc0305 HIS PLANS INCLUDE RESTRUCTURING SOME DEBT AND SELLING ONE OF THE COMPANY'S FIVE DIVISIONS TO HELP GENERATE ENOUGH CAPITAL TO FINANCE THE GROWTH OF THE OTHER FOUR
49dc0306 HE DECLINED TO IDENTIFY THE DIVISION THAT WILL BE SOLD
49dc0307 THE LOOK AND FEEL CASES ARE GENERATING CONTROVERSY IN THE INDUSTRY
49dc0308 COMPANIES BRINGING THE SUITS SAY THEY ARE DEFENDING THE REWARDS DUE THOSE WHO DEVELOP INNOVATIVE SOFTWARE FROM COMPANIES THAT ARE SELLING CUT RATE COPIES
49dc0309 BUT OTHERS ARGUE THAT NEW SOFTWARE ALWAYS BORROWS FROM THE OLD <NOISE>
49dc030a THEY SAY LOTUS IF ITS SUIT SUCCEEDS WILL STIFLE INNOVATION AND DISCOURAGE THE SPREAD OF STANDARDS THAT HELP COMPUTER USERS MASTER SOFTWARE MADE BY DIFFERENT COMPANIES
49dc030b CONGRESS GAVE THE SPACE AGENCY'S PLAN MIXED REVIEWS
49dc030c REPRESENTATIVE BILL LOWERY REPUBLICAN CALIFORNIA WHO HAS BEEN OUTSPOKEN ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF SECURING A SECOND BOOSTER ROCKET SUPPLIER PRAISED THE PLAN

49dc030f AFTER CONTRACTING ONE POINT EIGHT PERCENT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE THE ISLAND'S GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT GREW ONE POINT NINE PERCENT LAST YEAR ACCORDING TO THE GOVERNMENT'S INITIAL ESTIMATES
49dc030g EXPANSION OF THREE PERCENT TO FOUR PERCENT IS PREDICTED FOR THIS YEAR
49dc030h DOUBLEDAY ALSO PROVIDED BERTELSMANN WITH MUCH NEEDED U. S. BOOK MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS
49dc030i MOREOVER MR. VITALE SAYS IT'S WORTH A PREMIUM TO GET A FOOTHOLD IN THE U. S. MARKET
49dc030j IF YOU ARE IN PUBLISHING THE ONLY MARKET WITH LARGE NUMBERS IS THE ENGLISH SPEAKING MARKET HE SAYS
49dc030k POLITICAL OBSERVERS THEORIZE THAT THE POLITICAL REHABILITATION IS LINKED TO THIS INVISIBLE PRESIDENTIAL RACE
49dc030l SOME SAY FOR INSTANCE THAT MR. DE LA MADRID PUT THE FORMER MINISTER ON DISPLAY TO GOAD OTHER CANDIDATES INTO WORKING HARDER
49dc030m OTHERS SUGGEST THAT ONE PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL IS USING THE POPULAR MR. SILVA HERZOG TO UNDERMINE HIS RIVALS
49dc030n THE MOST PROVOCATIVE HYPOTHESIS HAS IT THAT MR. SILVA HERZOG HAS HIMSELF BECOME A CANDIDATE AGAIN
49dc030o WE ARE AWARE OF OUR INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS AND WE WILLINGLY ACCEPT THEM THE BANKER OBSERVES
49dc030p BUT THE BUNDESBANK HE ASSERTS HAS TO BE VERY CAUTIOUS IN SETTING ITS MONETARY POLICY
49dc030q FROM OUR POINT OF VIEW WE ALREADY HAVE A PERMISSIVE POLICY HE SAYS
49dc030r MR. WRIGHT DIDN'T LIST THOSE EARNINGS ON NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN PERSONAL FINANCE DISCLOSURE FORMS
49dc030s ATTORNEY DANIEL SWILLINGER SAID AT A MINIMUM HE SHOULD HAVE DISCLOSED THIS THE SIX THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR ESCROW AS AN ASSET
49dc030t MR. SWILLINGER COUNSELED REPRESENTATIVE NEWT GINGRICH REPUBLICAN GEORGIA ON THE DRAFTING OF A COMPLAINT AGAINST MR. WRIGHT THAT HELPED TOUCH OFF THE ETHICS INVESTIGATION
49dc030u THE ONE ELEMENT OF SUSPENSE REMAINS THE SELECTION OF A RUNNING MATE FOR VICE PRESIDENT BUSH'S PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN
49dc030v BUSH MANAGERS INSIST THEY WON'T DISCLOSE THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE'S IDENTITY UNTIL THURSDAY MORNING
49dc030w REAGAN ARRIVED AT THE CONVENTION SITE LAST NIGHT AND PREPARED FOR HIS FAREWELL SPEECH TO THE PARTY TONIGHT
49dc030x THE PRESIDENT LEAVES FOR CALIFORNIA TOMORROW AND BUSH WILL ARRIVE TO TAKE CONTROL OF THE CONVENTION
49dc030y IT IS A CRUCIAL TIME IN WHICH BUSH MUST ATTEMPT TO MOVE OUT FROM UNDER REAGAN'S SHADOW AND ESTABLISH HIS OWN IDENTITY
49dc030z THE DECISION TO INTERRUPT THE OLYMPIC COVERAGE COULD MEAN A POTENTIAL ADVERTISING REVENUE LOSS OF EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS ACCORDING TO MICHAEL GARTNER PRESIDENT OF N. B. C. NEWS
49dc0310 <NOISE> THE DEBATES WOULDN'T BE INTERRUPTED BY ADS
49dc0311 AFTER SOME SECOND GUESSING ON THEIR EARLIER DECISION TO SKIP THE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE MR. GARTNER SAID THE NETWORK OFFICIALS CHANGED THEIR MINDS YESTERDAY
49dc0312 EIGHT MILLION BUCKS ISN'T SOMETHING YOU WANT TO KISS AWAY BUT YOU SWALLOW HARD AND DO WHAT YOU THINK IS RIGHT MR. GARTNER SAID

49dc0316 WE LOVE THESE HORSES HE SAYS
49dc0317 WE HAVE A RECESSION BUT MANY PEOPLE ARE RICH
49dc0318 IF YOU HAVE A HOUSE AND PICTURES YOU WANT A HORSE AN ARABIAN HORSE
49dc0319 EXACTLY LIKE AMERICA
49dc031a IF YOU DON'T HAVE AN ARABIAN HORSE YOU CANNOT MEET MR. ARMAND HAMMER
49dc031b IF YOU HAVE AN ARABIAN HORSE HE IS YOUR FRIEND
49dc031c WHEN THE HOUSE AND SENATE APPROVED THE TAX BILL EARLY SATURDAY LAWMAKERS DIDN'T MENTION THE LAST MINUTE PROVISIONS AND CONGRESSIONAL STAFFERS DESCRIBED THEM AS TECHNICAL
49dc031d WHILE THE ESTIMATED REVENUE OF ALMOST ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OVER THREE YEARS IS RELATIVELY SMALL THE PROVISIONS MIGHT BE PERCEIVED AS AN ANTI TAKEOVER PUSH BY CONGRESS
49dc031e THEY COULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF SLOWING CERTAIN TAKEOVER ACTIVITY CONGRESSIONAL SOURCES ACKNOWLEDGED OVER THE WEEKEND
49dc031f TO BE SURE ON A LOT OF SCORES THE SUMMIT WAS A SUCCESS
49dc031g ECONOMIC COOPERATION WAS ADVANCED WITH BUSINESSMEN SIGNING AGREEMENTS FOR ABOUT THIRTY CONTRACTS AND SEVERAL JOINT VENTURES
49dc031h HUMAN RIGHTS TOO MAY HAVE TAKEN A STEP FORWARD IF MR. GORBACHEV LIVES UP TO HIS PROMISE TO RELEASE ALL POLITICAL PRISONERS BY YEAR'S END
49dc0401 LAFARGE ALSO NAMED ROBERT W. MURDOCH FORTY FOUR PRESIDENT AND CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER
49dc0402 MR. FRANCOIS PREVIOUSLY HELD THE POST OF PRESIDENT THE POST OF CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER IS NEW

49dc0404 THE NASDAQ O. T. C. COMPOSITE INDEX ROSE TWO POINT TWO SIX TO FOUR TWO NINE POINT ZERO ZERO
49dc0405 IN THE O. T. C. MARKET THERE WERE ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND NINETY THREE ISSUES ADVANCING AND NINE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY NINE DECLINING

49dc0407 THE AMERICAN STOCK EXCHANGE MARKET VALUE INDEX ROSE THREE POINT ONE SEVEN TO THREE *TWO* NINE POINT FOUR SEVEN
49dc0408 BOTH THE NASDAQ AND AMEX INDEXES SURPASSED RECORDS SET WEDNESDAY
49dc0409 U. S. BANK REGULATIONS ARE ANOTHER STUMBLING BLOCK
49dc040a CURRENTLY BANKS CAN'T OWN MORE THAN NINETEEN POINT NINE PERCENT OF A NON FINANCIAL COMPANY AND CAN ONLY BE PASSIVE INVESTORS
49dc040b UNLESS THESE RESTRICTIONS ARE DROPPED BANKS ARE LIKELY TO BE SWAPPING MAINLY FOR EQUITY IN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
49dc040c THOSE AREN'T ALWAYS APPEALING OR EVEN AVAILABLE
49dc040d MEXICO NATIONALIZED ITS BANKS FIVE YEARS AGO
49dc040e AND IN BRAZIL CENTRAL BANK FIGURES SHOW THAT ONE OUT OF EVERY SEVEN BANK LOANS IS PAST DUE EIGHT TIMES THE DELINQUENCY RATE OF A YEAR EARLIER
49dc040f THE STOCK SPLIT WILL BE DISTRIBUTED ON OR ABOUT JULY SECOND TO HOLDERS OF RECORD ON JUNE TWENTY SIXTH
49dc040g AFTER THE DIVIDEND THE COMPANY WILL HAVE ABOUT SEVEN POINT EIGHT MILLION SHARES OUTSTANDING
49dc040h THE COMPANY SAID IT WILL DISCONTINUE PAYING THE PREVIOUS REGULAR QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND OF FIFTEEN CENTS A SHARE AFTER THE STOCK DIVIDEND IS PAID TO CONSERVE CASH FOR FUTURE ACQUISITIONS

49dc040j WITH LESS REGULATORY AND POLITICAL PRESSURE CONRAIL WAS ABLE TO ABANDON ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND MILES OF TRACK BETWEEN NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE AND NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
49dc040k ABOUT HALF OF THAT HAS BEEN TAKEN UP BY SHORT LINE RAILROADS NONUNION RAILROADS THAT HAVE CONTINUED TO PROVIDE THE SERVICE AT A LESSER COST
49dc040l THEY BRING THE BUSINESS TO US AND WE HANDLE IT AS A TRUNK LINE
49dc040m BURMAH A BRITISH OIL COMPANY AND S. H. V. A DUTCH ENERGY CONCERN SAID THEY WOULD PROCEED WITH THEIR OFFER ONLY IF CALOR ENDORSED THE BID
49dc040n A SPOKESMAN FOR BURMAH SAID THAT THE PROPOSAL MADE YESTERDAY WAS FINAL AND THAT BURMAH AND S. H. V. WOULDN'T CONTEMPLATE A HOSTILE OFFER
49dc040o HE ALSO RULED OUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT BURMAH MIGHT LAUNCH A BID ON ITS OWN
49dc040p IVAN TOMS ISN'T IN A FESTIVE MOOD AS HE CONTEMPLATES HIS IMPENDING CONFRONTATION WITH THE MILITARY
49dc040q I KNOW IT WILL BE HORRIFIC HE SAYS STARING DOWN AT HIS LUNCH BUT IT IS IMPORTANT TO TAKE THIS STAND
49dc040r I THINK INDIVIDUALS CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE
49dc040s THE BUDGET HOWEVER WILL NOT MANAGE ITSELF
49dc040t SOME WAY MUST BE FOUND TO PUT IT ON COURSE
49dc040u IN OUR HISTORY AN IMPASSE OVER POLICY HAS BEEN BROKEN OCCASIONALLY BY SOME SORT OF NATIONAL COMMISSION AND IT IS TIME FOR ONE AGAIN
49dc040v SUCH A COMMISSION RESOLVED THE SOCIAL SECURITY PROBLEM EARLIER IN THIS DECADE
49dc040w IN THE JOHNSON YEARS A COMMISSION'S PROPOSALS WERE THE MEANS FOR RESTRUCTURING THE BUDGET
49dc040x STILL EARLIER IT WAS A COMMISSION THAT RECOMMENDED THE CREATION OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM
49dc040y THIS APPROACH ENABLES THE PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS OF CONGRESS TO AVOID SOME FLAK BY MERELY IMPLEMENTING WHAT THE COMMISSION TOLD US TO DO
49dc040z THUS THE BOARD SAID IT WOULD BE RELUCTANT TO GIVE BANK OF NEW YORK MORE THAN ONE EXTENSION OF THE INITIAL NINETY DAYS TO CONSUMMATE THE MERGER
49dc0410 NORMALLY EXTENSIONS OF THE NINETY DAY RULE ARE GRANTED FREELY
49dc0411 BUT IN THE PENDING MERGER THE BOARD WANTS TO AVOID A LONG AND FRUITLESS STRUGGLE SAID MICHAEL BRADFIELD THE FED'S GENERAL COUNSEL
49dc0412 ONE OF THE MORE DIRECT READINGS ON INFLATION WILL COME IN FRIDAY'S REPORT ON CONSUMER PRICES WHICH ARE EXPECTED NOT SURPRISINGLY TO BE HIGHER
49dc0413 ANALYSTS EXPECT AN INCREASE OF ABOUT POINT FOUR PERCENT IN THE APRIL CONSUMER PRICE INDEX ON THE HEELS OF A POINT FIVE PERCENT JUMP THE PREVIOUS MONTH
49dc0414 THE PRICE INCREASES ARE EXPECTED PRETTY MUCH ACROSS THE BOARD AS COMMODITIES AND SERVICES ARE RISING AT ABOUT A FOUR PERCENT ANNUAL RATE
49dc0415 BUT THERE IS ALWAYS THE RISK THAT REVIVING A CLASSIC SLOGAN OR SPOKESMAN WILL BACKFIRE AND CREATE AN OLD FASHIONED IMAGE FOR A BRAND
49dc0416 TO GUARD AGAINST THAT MARKETERS TEND TO GIVE THEIR RECYCLED ADS A CONTEMPORARY TWIST
49dc0417 <NOISE> THE CAPTAIN RAID OF NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT FOR EXAMPLE HAS RIPPLING MUSCLES AND A FUTURISTIC LOOK
49dc0418 AND A WOMAN IN ONE OF THE NEW NESTEA SPOTS DOESN'T JUST TUMBLE <NOISE> INTO A SWIMMING POOL SHE FALLS ONTO AN EXERCISE MAT THAT TURNS INTO A POOL
49dc0419 <NOISE> PRICES AT THE MASS RETAIL LEVEL HOWEVER HAVEN'T RISEN MUCH IN A DECADE PARTLY BECAUSE BIG RETAILERS USE TENNIS BALLS TO LURE SHOPPERS
49dc041a I REMEMBER PURCHASING A CAN OF BALLS FOR TWO DOLLARS IN NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN SAYS WALTER L. HENRY A PITTSBURGH RECREATIONAL PLAYER
49dc041b TWO WEEKS AGO I PICKED UP A CAN FOR A DOLLAR AND EIGHTY NINE

49ec020d MANY BLUE CHIP ISSUES LOST AS MUCH AS TWO PERCENT WITH A FEW DROPPING AS MUCH AS FOUR PERCENT
49ec020e FINANCIAL SHARES WERE HIT HARDEST AMONG FEARS OF HIGHER INTEREST RATES
49ec020f INEVITABLY SOME WILL SEEK A FOURTH ALTERNATIVE TO CONTINUE BORROWING FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD MAKING ONLY MARGINAL ADJUSTMENTS IN OUR ECONOMIC POLICIES
49ec020g EARLIER THIS CENTURY THE BRITISH TAUGHT US THAT DEBT AND LEADERSHIP CANNOT LONG CO EXIST
49ec020h EVENTUALLY AND THE MARKETS SEEM TO BE SAYING SOONER RATHER THAN LATER WE WILL HAVE TO CHOOSE
49ec020i WE SAW IT WITH OIL AND WE'RE SEEING IT WITH GOLD SAYS JOHN DESSAUER AN ORLEANS MASSACHUSETTS MONEY MANAGER

49ec020n MUCH OF THIS SWAMP CREATURE TREATMENT CAME TO A HEAD IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX LAWSUITS OVER CREATIONISM AND SECULAR HUMANISM IN SCHOOL TEXTS
49ec020o THE ESTABLISHMENT MADE VIRTUALLY NO EFFORT TO PUSH BELOW THE SURFACE OF THESE GRIEVANCES
49ec020p BIDS TOTALING FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS WERE SUBMITTED

49ec020t THE ALLIANCE ISSUED A *COMMUNIQUE* THAT STRESSED ITS DETERMINATION TO DECIDE ON A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO FURTHER ARMS CONTROL TREATIES
49ec020u BUT IT SIDESTEPPED DECISIONS ON DIVISIVE ISSUES SUCH AS MODERNIZING THE SHORT RANGE NUCLEAR WEAPONS BASED IN WEST GERMANY
49ec020v UNFAIR OR NOT THE QUESTIONS ARE BEING ASKED ABOUT BOTH THE REVOLUTION'S ROUTE AND ITS GOALS HOW MUCH VIOLENCE WILL THERE BE
49ec020w WILL WHITES HAVE POLITICAL RIGHTS
49ec020x HOW MANY WHITES WILL LOSE THEIR JOBS
49ec020y HOW COMMUNIST IS THE A. N. C.
49ec020z HOW MUCH WILL THE GOVERNMENT CONTROL THE ECONOMY
49ec0210 IN JANUARY SIGNS OF A WEAKENING ECONOMY PROMPTED CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN AND VICE CHAIRMAN JOHNSON TO PUSH THROUGH A SLIGHT EASING OF POLICY ALLOWING INTEREST RATES TO FALL
49ec0211 GOVERNOR ANGELL WORRIED BY THE STRONG COMMODITY PRICES WAS RELUCTANT TO GO ALONG

49ec030s VIEWERS AND CRITICS SAY THE HUGE LOAD OF ADS AND AIRTIME IS PART OF THE PROBLEM
49ec030t COMMERCIAL CLUTTER SEEMS GREATER THAN IN PREVIOUS OLYMPICS BROADCASTS MANY CRITICS SAY
49ec030u THE COVERAGE BETWEEN ADS SOME COMPLAIN IS FRAGMENTED AND SHIFTY JUMPING TOO QUICKLY AMONG MYRIAD SPORTS
49ec030v ACTUAL EVENTS AS OPPOSED TO TAPED PROFILES PREVIEWS AND REPORTS TAKE UP LESS THAN HALF OF THE AIRTIME
49ec030w MANY HEADLINE EVENTS DON'T APPEAR UNTIL AFTER MIDNIGHT
49ec030x THE STUDY WAS PART OF CORNELL'S RESPONSE TO CALLS BY LOCAL POLITICIANS THAT IT SHOULD HELP MORE IN TOMPKINS COUNTY
49ec030y WHEN THE SCHOOLS WERE RANKED BY OPERATING BUDGET OR VALUE OF BUILDINGS CORNELL'S ONE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLAR PAYMENTS WERE FOUND TO BE NEAR THE BOTTOM OF THE LIST
49ec030z IN PER STUDENT PAYMENTS CORNELL RANKED SEVENTH AT SEVENTY DOLLARS
49ec0310 MR. DELCHAMPS SAID THIRTY PERCENT OF THE COMPANY'S STOCK OUTSTANDING IS HELD BY PEOPLE WHO HAVE AGREED NOT TO SELL THEIR HOLDINGS BEFORE OCTOBER THIRTY FIRST
49ec0311 ANOTHER TWENTY FIVE PERCENT IS HELD UNDER THE COMPANY'S EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN
49ec0312 MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN THE FORMER CATEGORY ARE EXPECTED TO EXTEND THE NO SELL AGREEMENT FOR ANOTHER YEAR HE SAID
49ec0313 THE LOWER VOLATILITY COULD BE ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW WHEN THE COURSE OF INTEREST RATES <NOISE> SEEMS ESPECIALLY CLOUDY
49ec0314 WHILE INTEREST RATES HAVE BEEN DECLINING RECENTLY MANY ECONOMISTS EXPECT RATES TO RISE BY YEAR END
49ec0315 AFTER THAT HOWEVER THEY SAY RATES COULD FALL AGAIN PERHAPS SHARPLY AS ECONOMIC GROWTH SLOWS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE
49ec0316 JACKSON DEMOCRATS SEE MR. JACKSON AS AN ACTIVIST STRONG LEADER WHO IS MORE WILLING TO TAKE RISKS THAN THOSE IN THE OFTEN BLANDER CONGRESSIONAL WING OF THE PARTY

49ec0318 IT IS NEVER WISE TO IGNORE THOSE YOU CAN DEPEND ON SAYS SONIA JARVIS OF THE NATIONAL COALITION ON BLACK VOTER PARTICIPATION
49ec0319 IN APRIL DREXEL AGREED TO PAY SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AND PLEAD GUILTY TO SIX FELONY COUNTS RELATED TO A FEDERAL INSIDER TRADING INVESTIGATION
49ec031a THE PLEA AGREEMENT WAS MADE IN CONJUNCTION WITH A BROAD SETTLEMENT OF SECURITIES LAW VIOLATIONS WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
49ec031b BECAUSE THE FIRM AGREED THAT IT COMMITTED FELONIES SECURITIES COMMISSIONERS IN MOST STATES CAN AUTOMATICALLY REVOKE DREXEL'S LICENSE TO DO BUSINESS
49ec031c WHY THIS INCREDIBLE DIVERSION OF EFFORT TO CRIMES THAT ARE OFTEN NOT CLEARLY DEFINED BY STATUTE AND WHERE IDENTIFIABLE VICTIMS ARE SELDOM FOUND
49ec031d MAYBE TOO MANY OF TODAY'S PROSECUTORS WERE INFLUENCED BY THE PREVAILING COUNTERCULTURE SUSPICIONS OF MIDDLE CLASS MORALITY DURING THEIR LAW SCHOOL DAYS
49ec031e BUT ANOTHER ANSWER IS SIMPLER IT IS EASIER TO EXTRACT PLEA BARGAINS FROM TRADERS WITH A MERE MENTION OF R. I. C. O. THAN FROM REAL FELONS
49ec0401 AS A LONGTIME MEMBER OF THE ANAHEIM CALIFORNIA
49ec0402 REDEVELOPMENT COMMISSION THE RETIRED FOOD COMPANY EXECUTIVE TOOK PRIDE IN HELPING HIS CITY GROW
49ec0403 BUT HE ALSO LOVED THE FREE SILVER PASS THAT DISNEYLAND GAVE HIM EVERY YEAR AS ONE OF NEARLY ONE THOUSAND LOCAL NOTABLES SO HONORED

49ec0405 B. P.'S PARTIALLY PAID AMERICAN DEPOSITARY SHARES CLOSED UNCHANGED AT SEVENTEEN AND A QUARTER WITH THIRTEEN POINT TWO MILLION TRADED
49ec0406 IT WAS THE BIG BOARD'S MOST ACTIVE ISSUE
49ec0407 DURING THE PAST SEVERAL DAYS CORPORATIONS AND OTHER BIG INVESTORS HAVE REFRAINED FROM LENDING TREASURY BONDS AND NOTES TO SECURITIES DEALERS FOR BRIEF PERIODS
49ec0408 THAT IN TURN HAS FORCED MANY DEALERS TO REFRAIN FROM SELLING BORROWED SECURITIES OR AMASSING SO CALLED SHORT POSITIONS
49ec0409 IT'S HARD TO SHORT ANYTHING IN THIS MARKET AT THE MOMENT SAID A TRADER AT A LARGE GOVERNMENT SECURITIES DEALER
49ec040a MOST ANALYSTS SAID THE INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS OF THE TWO BANKS MAKE A GOOD FIT
49ec040b GENERALE DE BANQUE HAS A STRONG NETWORK IN AFRICA WHILE AMRO HAS MORE OPERATIONS IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND FAR EAST
49ec040c AND WHILE GENERALE DE BANQUE HAS AN IMPORTANT COMMERCIAL BANKING OPERATION AMRO HAS MORE EXPERIENCE IN BROKERAGE AND INVESTMENT SERVICES FOR ITS CLIENTS
49ec040d THINGS ARE A BIT DULLER THIS YEAR
49ec040e MR. BILZERIAN HAS SENT HIS BOY TO A LITTLE LEAGUE TEAM IN FARAWAY MINNESOTA WHERE THE FAMILY SPENDS ITS SUMMER AND ISN'T COACHING A TEAM THIS YEAR
49ec040f ALL THE ACTION APPARENTLY WILL BE IN THE COURTROOM
49ec040g IT'S A SITUATION WHERE WE ARE LEARNING OUR WAY WITH THE ALLANTE THE SPOKESMAN SAID
49ec040h THE CAR IS DOING THE THINGS THAT WE WANT IT TO DO FOR US AS FAR AS GETTING VISIBILITY FOR THE DIVISION AND BEING AN IMAGE CAR
49ec040i SINCE IT'S BEEN A NEW ENTITY FOR CADILLAC AND OUR DEALERS WE WEREN'T QUITE SURE WHAT THE ACTUAL SALES VOLUME WOULD BE
49ec040j CAYTON WHO AT AGE SEVENTY HAS BEEN AROUND A BIT LONGER ISN'T QUITE SO SURE
49ec040k ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT I HOPE MIKE'S MIND IS STRAIGHT HE SAYS
49ec040l I ALSO HOPE THAT SOMEONE SOMEWHERE GIVES HIM SOME GOOD ADVICE BEFORE HE DOES SOMETHING VERY UNWISE
49ec040m MR. VIET HAS BIGGER WORRIES
49ec040n APART FROM UNCOOPERATIVE TARGETS THE PAPER AND ITS THIRTY TWO JOURNALISTS FACE A CHALLENGE TO BECOME MORE PROFESSIONAL HE SAYS
49ec040o CRITICIZING SHORTCOMINGS ISN'T ENOUGH
49ec040p WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE ACHIEVEMENTS
49ec040q WE HAVE TO DEVELOP JUDGMENT AND THAT ISN'T EASY
49ec040r MR. CHATICHAI'S WEALTHY FAMILY BACKGROUND AND HIS FAMILY'S LARGE PROPERTY INTERESTS GIVE HIM A GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY
49ec040s FURTHER HE HAS GOOD RELATIONS WITH THE LARGE ETHNIC CHINESE COMMUNITY AND SERVES AS CHAIRMAN OF THE THAI CHINESE FRIENDSHIP ASSOCIATION
49ec040t THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE COUNTRY'S BUSINESS ELITE MANY OF WHOM ARE ETHNIC CHINESE
49ec040u AND IT DOESN'T APPEAR THAT CABLE OWNERS WILL RESIST THE CHANGE
49ec040v A SPOKESMAN FOR THE NATIONAL CABLE TELEVISION ASSOCIATION SAID WE DON'T OPPOSE THE PROPOSAL IN PRINCIPLE
49ec040w WE TAKE THE POSITION THAT THE MORE PEOPLE IN THE CABLE MARKET THE BETTER
49ec040x NEW YORK CITY'S BOARD OF EDUCATION WOULD DISAGREE

49ec0410 AND MOST VEHEMENTLY OF ALL THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS
49ec0411 BENETTON DENIES ALL CHARGES ON THE SPECIFIC ACCUSATIONS BY UNHAPPY STORE OWNERS AND STEADFASTLY MAINTAINS THAT IT ISN'T A FRANCHISE OPERATION AND THUS ISN'T SUBJECT TO FRANCHISE REQUIREMENTS
49ec0412 STORE OWNERS IT SAYS ARE LICENSEES BECAUSE THEY OWN THEIR STORES AND DON'T PAY ROYALTIES TO BENETTON AS FRANCHISEES TYPICALLY DO
49ec0413 ALTHOUGH IT ACKNOWLEDGES THAT A FEW STORE OWNERS HAVE COMPLAINED IT BLAMES ANY PROBLEMS ON THE OWNERS THEMSELVES OR ON ITS FIELD REPRESENTATIVES WHO DEAL DIRECTLY WITH THEM
49ec0414 DESPITE THE PROBLEM WITH THE CLARIDGE MR. WYNN DIDN'T RULE OUT AN EVENTUAL RETURN TO THE ATLANTIC CITY GAMBLING SCENE
49ec0415 IT'S DISAPPOINTING HE SAID OF THE FAILED PROPOSAL
49ec0416 BUT THIS IS A LIVELY MARKET AND WE HAVEN'T GIVEN UP YET
49ec0417 THE MARKET FOR HOME GEAR IS GROWING AS SPENDING SHIFTS FROM APPAREL TO THE HOME SAYS KURT BARNARD OF THE RETAIL MARKETING REPORT NEW YORK
49ec0418 HE SAYS SALES AT HOME RELATED STORES ARE GROWING NINETY ONE PERCENT FASTER THAN AT DEPARTMENT STORES AND SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT FASTER THAN AT APPAREL STORES

49ec041a WHILE SECOND QUARTER HOUSING STARTS WERE DOWN THIRTY PERCENT FROM TWO YEARS AGO FURNITURE SALES WERE UP EIGHTEEN PERCENT HE SAYS
49ec041b THESE MIXED FEELINGS OF FRUSTRATION WITH AND GRATITUDE TOWARD THE AUTHORITIES ARE PART OF THE EVERYDAY LIFE OF A FOREIGNER DOING BUSINESS IN KOREA
49ec041c IN FACT SUCH CONTRADICTIONS ARE WHAT SEEM TO MAKE THE KOREAN WORLD GO ROUND
49ec041d A WESTERN BUSINESSMAN NEEDS TO BE READY FOR THEM
49ec041e HERE ARE A FEW HARD LEARNED FACTS OF KOREAN BUSINESS LIFE
49fc0201 MR. GRANT WAS TRAVELING AND UNAVAILABLE FOR COMMENT
49fc0202 <NOISE> OTHER OFFICIALS OF GRANT BROADCASTING AREN'T AUTHORIZED TO COMMENT ON ANY ASPECTS OF THE CASE AIDES TO MR. GRANT SAID
49fc0203 <NOISE> THE COMPANY'S BANKRUPTCY CASE LAWYER IN PHILADELPHIA WASN'T AVAILABLE FOR COMMENT
49fc0204 MR. SHLENKER COULDN'T BE REACHED
49fc0205 BECAUSE OF THAT SOME WALL STREET PROFESSIONALS THINK THE STOCK LOOKS RATHER EXPENSIVE
49fc0206 IT HAS TRIPLED SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE LARGELY ON TAKEOVER SPECULATION
49fc0207 IT CURRENTLY TRADES AT ABOUT NINE TIMES CASH FLOW SAYS ALAN GAINES OF GAINES BERLAND AN INSTITUTIONAL BROKERAGE FIRM
49fc0208 THAT'S ABOUT A THIRTY PERCENT PREMIUM TO QUALITY OIL COMPANIES LIKE ROYAL DUTCH PETROLEUM EXXON AND MOBIL HE SAYS
49fc0209 <NOISE> TO THESE ENDS K. P. C. ENJOYS A HUGE ECONOMIC ADVANTAGE
49fc020a IT COSTS KUWAIT ABOUT A DOLLAR TO PUMP A BARREL OF OIL AND ANOTHER FIFTY CENTS TO BRING IT TO EUROPE
49fc020b THE PRODUCTION COST OF NORTH SEA OIL BY CONTRAST RUNS BETWEEN EIGHT DOLLARS AND THIRTEEN DOLLARS A BARREL
49fc020c THE BIG DIFFERENCE DISTURBS EUROPEAN OIL MEN
49fc020d <NOISE> THE QUESTION WAS WHAT FORM THIS CONFLICT WOULD TAKE
49fc020e THE CIVIL WAR WAS FINALLY FOUGHT OVER MAINTAINING THE UNION
49fc020f BUT WHAT IF THERE HAD BEEN NO UNION
49fc020g WHAT IF THE SOUTH HAD BEEN A SEPARATE NATION
49fc020h WOULD SOUTHERNERS BLACK OR WHITE HAVE EVER ACHIEVED FULL EQUALITY IF THEY HAD BEEN INCORPORATED INTO THE UNION AS A CONQUERED PROVINCE
49fc020i OR WHAT IF THE WAR HAD BEEN AVOIDED AND SLAVERY JUST DRIFTED ON AND ON
49fc020j WOULD THE SOUTH HAVE BECOME ANOTHER SOUTH AFRICA
49fc020k I WOULDN'T BET AGAINST IT <NOISE>
49fc020l IT STILL ISN'T CLEAR WHAT FORM THE INCREASES WILL TAKE OR WHEN THEY WILL GO INTO EFFECT
49fc020m SOME CARRIERS SAID THEY PLAN TO RAISE FARES SUNDAY AND OTHERS SAID THEY WILL ACT A WEEK LATER
49fc020n SOME AIRLINES ALSO SAID THE INCREASES WON'T AFFECT THEIR LOWEST DISCOUNT FARES
49fc020o IN ADDITION LAURENTIAN SAID BERNHARD M. KOCH THIRTY THREE WAS NAMED VICE PRESIDENT AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER
49fc020p <NOISE> HE SUCCEEDS JOHN STROM WHO TRANSFERRED TO A LAURENTIAN CAPITAL UNIT
49fc020q PREVIOUSLY MR. KOCH WAS DIRECTOR OF INTERNAL AUDIT AT LAURENTIAN GROUP CORPORATION AND IMPERIAL LIFE ASSURANCE COMPANY OF CANADA MAJORITY SHAREHOLDERS OF LAURENTIAN CAPITAL
49fc020r BUT THEY MAY NOT BE TRYING HARD ENOUGH OR AT LEAST NOT IN THE RIGHT WAYS
49fc020s THEY NEED ONLY LISTEN TO THE GROUP OF EIGHT WOMEN GATHERED HERE FOR A DISCUSSION OF WHAT THEY LIKE AND WHAT THEY DON'T ABOUT THE LATEST TRENDS IN FASHION RETAILING
49fc020t MANUFACTURERS WOULD SWIFTLY LEARN THAT THEIR CLOTHES OFTEN AREN'T RIGHT FOR WOMEN WHO WORK WHILE RETAILERS WOULD FIND THAT THEY HAVEN'T SUFFICIENTLY TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT THEIR CUSTOMERS' BUSY LIVES
49fc020u NEW YORK CITY'S BOARD OF EDUCATION WOULD DISAGREE
49fc020v MY HIGH SCHOOL'S ADMINISTRATION WOULD TOO
49fc020w ALSO MY UNION THE UNITED FEDERATION OF TEACHERS AND EVERY REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRAT WHO HAS EVER RUN FOR PUBLIC OFFICE ANYWHERE
49fc020x AND MOST VEHEMENTLY OF ALL THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS
49fc020y CHEMICAL'S TEXAS COMMERCE BANCSHARES INCORPORATED UNIT REPORTED PROFIT OF SIX POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS
49fc020z THAT FIGURE INCLUDES A THIRTEEN MILLION DOLLAR GAIN FROM INTERCOMPANY INCOME TAX BENEFITS UNDER THE CORPORATION'S TAX SHARING AGREEMENT
49fc0210 IN THE YEAR AGO QUARTER TEXAS COMMERCE HAD A LOSS OF THIRTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WHICH INCLUDED A SPECIAL CHARGE FROM THE RESTRUCTURING
49fc0211 CHEMICAL ACQUIRED TEXAS COMMERCE IN MAY NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
49fc0212 THE RICHMOND VIRGINIA MEDIA CONCERN SAID SALES AND PROFIT FROM ITS NEWSPRINT OPERATIONS WERE AHEAD OF YEAR EARLIER LEVELS
49fc0213 ITS CABLE SYSTEM CONTINUED TO GAIN SUBSCRIBERS NOW TOTALING MORE THAN A HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND
49fc0214 REVENUE PER SUBSCRIBER IS EXCEEDING FORECASTS MEDIA GENERAL SAID ADDING THAT IT PLANS TO INCREASE RATES AN AVERAGE OF EIGHT PERCENT BEGINNING IN JANUARY
49fc0215 <NOISE> PRICES GRADUALLY MOVED HIGHER THROUGH MIDAFTERNOON WHEN THE MARKET PEAKED AND THEN STARTED ITS RETREAT
49fc0216 PHILIP PUCCIO MANAGER OF INSTITUTIONAL *TRADING* AT DILLON READ AND COMPANY SAID SOME INSTITUTIONS USED THE ADVANCE AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO SOME SELLING
49fc0217 THEY'VE BEEN PEELING OFF SOME STOCK TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF BETTER PRICES HE SAID
49fc0218 <NOISE> <NOISE> DURING THE SPRING AND SUMMER THE FED NUDGED UP SHORT TERM INTEREST RATES TO RESTRAIN THE ECONOMY
49fc0219 BUT WORRIED AS ALWAYS ABOUT BECOMING A POLITICAL FOOTBALL THE FED TRIED TO KEEP A LOW PROFILE IN THE WEEKS BEFORE THE ELECTION
49fc021a THAT STRATEGY WAS HELPED BY AN APPARENT SLOWDOWN IN ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE THIRD QUARTER WHICH EASED INFLATION WORRIES AND ALLOWED THE FED TO STOP PUSHING UP RATES
49fc021b <NOISE> IN THE YEAR EARLIER QUARTER THE LA JOLLA CALIFORNIA INDUSTRIAL AND INVESTMENT CONCERN HAD A RESTATED LOSS OF FIFTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS
49fc021c THE RESULTS WERE RESTATED TO REFLECT DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND THE CONSOLIDATION OF ITS SIGNAL LANDMARK HOLDINGS INCORPORATED UNIT A REAL ESTATE DEVELOPER

49fc021e FRANK ROBINSON THE HALL OF FAME HITTER WHO'S THE O'S MANAGER TAKES A LIKE TACK
49fc021f WE'RE NO POWERHOUSE BUT WE'VE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF OUR OPPORTUNITIES SAYS HE
49fc021g IF WE CAN KEEP THAT UP WE'LL BE ALL RIGHT
49fc0301 A SPOKESWOMAN FOR C. B. S. SAID THERE ARE SERIOUS ISSUES AND WE'RE TRYING OUR BEST TO FIND SOLUTIONS WHILE OPERATING IN A VERY DEMANDING ECONOMIC CLIMATE
49fc0302 WE'RE CONTINUING TO BARGAIN
49fc0303 <NOISE> CAPITAL CITIES /SLASH A. B. C. DECLINED TO COMMENT ON THE TALKS
49fc0304 BROKERAGE STOCKS HAVE BEEN WILTING FOR MONTHS BUT MR. CHANOS THINKS THEY COULD GET HIT LATER THIS YEAR IF OTHER FIRMS REPORT DOWN QUARTERS
49fc0305 SALOMON'S STOCK DIVED ELEVEN PERCENT ON HUGE VOLUME MONDAY CASTING A TEMPORARY PALL OVER THE WHOLE GROUP <NOISE>
49fc0306 IT CLOSED YESTERDAY AT THIRTY NINE AND SEVEN EIGHTHS UP ONE EIGHTH
49fc0307 SOME HAVE CHARACTERIZED OUR COUNTERMEASURES AS PROTECTIONIST BROUGHT ABOUT BECAUSE OF CONGRESSIONAL PRESSURES
49fc0308 THAT IS DEAD WRONG
49fc0309 WE HAVE BEEN IN CONSULTATIONS WITH JAPAN ON THIS ISSUE SINCE NOVEMBER LONG BEFORE PRESENT TRADE LEGISLATION WAS INTRODUCED
49fc030a THE PRESIDENT'S ACTION WAS THE CULMINATION OF THAT PROCESS AND IT HAD NOTHING WHATSOEVER TO DO WITH TRADE BILLS
49fc030b PRESIDENT REAGAN BELIEVES THAT PEOPLE AND NATIONS SHOULD HONOR THEIR OBLIGATIONS
49fc030c THERE IS NOTHING PROTECTIONIST ABOUT THAT
49fc030d SUCH COST CUTTING EFFORTS HAVE WORSENED LABOR DISPUTES WHICH HAVE IN TURN PITTED NON UNION PILOTS AGAINST PRO UNION PILOTS
49fc030e FIRST OFFICER GUY CASEY WAS ONCE A CAPTAIN AT CONTINENTAL BUT LOST HIS SENIORITY DURING THE BITTER STRIKE THERE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE WHICH HE HAD HELPED TO ORGANIZE
49fc030f HE SAYS HE WANTS TO PUT THE EXPERIENCE BEHIND HIM
49fc030g ANALYSTS ALSO SAID THEY HADN'T EXPECTED LOWER OPERATING PROFITS FOR THE COMPANY'S INDUSTRIES GROUP AND FOR THE BROADCASTING SEGMENT
49fc030h WESTINGHOUSE OFFICIALS TOLD ANALYSTS THAT OPERATING PROFIT IN THE INDUSTRIES GROUP FELL FIFTEEN PERCENT TO TWENTY PERCENT HURT IN PART BY WEAK RESULTS IN CANADIAN OPERATIONS
49fc030i A SHARP DROP IN OPERATING PROFIT FROM THE BROADCASTING GROUP'S PRODUCTION COMPANY CONTRIBUTED TO THE SLIGHTLY LOWER OPERATING EARNINGS OVERALL FOR THAT SEGMENT
49fc030j THE SPOKESMAN ALSO SAID THE LEAGUE'S OWNERS ARE COMMITTED TO PLAYING WITH THEIR CURRENT REPLACEMENT ROSTERS FOR THE REST OF THE SEASON INCLUDING THE SUPER BOWL IF NECESSARY
49fc030k THAT MAY BE THE CASE IF MR. UPSHAW CAN BE TAKEN AT HIS WORD
49fc030l <NOISE> HE HAS SAID THAT THE PLAYERS WILL REMAIN ON STRIKE FOR THE DURATION IF THE UNION'S OFFER WAS REJECTED
49fc030m THE SOVIETS OBVIOUSLY WANT TO MAKE IT AS DIFFICULT AS POSSIBLE FOR NATO TO CARRY OUT ITS MODERNIZATION SAID ONE WESTERN DIPLOMAT IN BONN
49fc030n A SENIOR NATO DIPLOMAT ACCUSED THE SOVIETS OF TRYING TO SEDUCE THE GERMANS AWAY FROM US
49fc030o IT IS NONE TOO SUBTLE WEDGE DRIVING HE TOLD REUTERS
49fc030p WE NEVER HAD ONE BEFORE MR. TIMBERS SAID
49fc030q A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF OUR CLIENTS WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THAT OPTION
49fc030r IT'S NOT NECESSARILY A MARKET CALL
49fc030s MR. TIMBERS SAYS HE'S FAIRLY AMBIVALENT ABOUT THE PRICE OF GOLD NEAR TERM
49fc030t HE DOES SEE HOWEVER HIGHER INFLATION OF FIVE PERCENT OR SO IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE UP FROM FOUR PERCENT THIS YEAR
49fc030u A GOLD OPTION COULD BE A NICE ALTERNATIVE FOR FIXED INCOME INVESTORS SHOULD INFLATION FEARS ARISE MR. TIMBERS SAYS
49fc030v SOME ECONOMISTS SAY INFLATIONARY PRESSURES COULD CONTINUE TO PUSH UP U. S. INTEREST RATES THIS YEAR
49fc030w <NOISE> IF SO FOREIGN CENTRAL BANKS MAY SEE THAT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO TIGHTEN AND TO ADDRESS THEIR OWN INFLATION WORRIES DESPITE U. S. CONCERN
49fc030x ONE FEAR SAYS IRVING TRUST ECONOMIST ROBERT MCGEE IS THAT HIGHER GLOBAL RATES WILL SEND THE FINANCIAL MARKETS INTO A TAILSPIN
49fc030y A SIMILAR VIEW IS HELD BY GRETA E. MARSHALL INVESTMENT MANAGER OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC EMPLOYEES' RETIREMENT SYSTEM WHICH MANAGES ABOUT FORTY FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS
49fc030z I STILL SEE NO EVIDENCE THAT INFLATION IS PICKING UP SUBSTANTIALLY SHE SAYS
49fc0310 THE ECONOMY DOESN'T LOOK SO STRONG THAT IT WILL REKINDLE INFLATION SO I WOULD VIEW ANY FURTHER DROP IN BOND PRICES AS A BUYING OPPORTUNITY
49fc0311 ALAS THEY PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE DEVOTED A LITTLE MORE THOUGHT TO WINNEBAGO'S PAST
49fc0312 THE COMPANY HAD A HISTORY OF CARNAGE AT THE TOP RUNNING THROUGH FIVE DIFFERENT CHIEF EXECUTIVES IN THE FOURTEEN YEARS BEFORE MESSRS.
49fc0313 GILBERT AND BERRETH STROLLED INTO TOWN
49fc0314 IN ONE OF THOSE SHAKE UPS WINNEBAGO'S CHAIRMAN AND FOUNDER JOHN K. HANSON SACKED HIS OWN SON

49fc0316 TO MAKE THEM DIRECTLY COMPARABLE EACH INDEX IS BASED ON THE CLOSE OF NINETEEN SIXTY NINE EQUALING ONE HUNDRED
49fc0317 THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE IS SINCE YEAR END
49fc0318 <NOISE> AFTER NEARLY EIGHT YEARS OF THE REAGAN PRESIDENCY A KIND OF MORNING AFTER MOOD PREVAILS HERE
49fc0319 THERE IS A SENSE THAT MR. REAGAN'S SUCCESSOR HASN'T ANY CHOICE BUT TO BE A CONSOLIDATION PRESIDENT
49fc031a GIVEN BUDGET CONSTRAINTS AND A RE ENERGIZED CONGRESS SOME HERE BELIEVE A BUSH ADMINISTRATION MAY NOT BE ALL THAT DIFFERENT FROM A DUKAKIS ADMINISTRATION
49fc031b SOME OF THAT CASH HAS BEEN USED FOR BONUS PAYMENTS
49fc031c WAGES AND BONUSES ROSE NINETEEN PERCENT IN THE FIRST HALF A RATE THAT FAR OUTPACED ECONOMIC GROWTH AND EXERTED UPWARD PRESSURE ON PRICES
49fc031d CHINA'S ECONOMY GREW AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF FIVE POINT SEVEN PERCENT IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS ROUGHLY HALF THE AVERAGE ANNUAL RATE IN THE PAST !DECADE

49fc0404 THE BANKS SOUGHT TO ELIMINATE A MISMATCH BETWEEN THEIR ASSETS PREDOMINANTLY HELD IN NON POUND CURRENCIES AND THEIR CAPITAL KEPT IN POUNDS
49fc0405 WHEN THE POUND WAS WEAK DURING THE EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTIES THE VALUE OF SCANDINAVIAN BANK'S CAPITAL FELL STEEPLY IN PROPORTION TO ITS NON DOLLAR ASSETS
49fc0406 THE BANKS THAT OWNED SCANDINAVIAN BANK HAD TO INJECT ABOUT FORTY SEVEN POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS OF ADDITIONAL CAPITAL
49fc0407 ALSO THE STRONG RISE IN SHARE PRICES IN RECENT WEEKS APPEARS TO HAVE DISCOUNTED MOST OF THE GOOD NEWS LIKELY IN THE BUDGET ANOTHER DEALER SAID
49fc0408 <NOISE> IT'S GOING TO TAKE QUITE A LOT TO MOVE IT SHARPLY AHEAD FROM THIS LEVEL HE SAID
49fc0409 THE ONE HUNDRED SHARE INDEX IS UP EIGHTEEN POINT SIX PERCENT THIS YEAR
49fc040a THE BOOK HE SAYS WILL BE ABOUT ARVIDA AND GENERALLY ABOUT COMPANIES SNARED IN THE TAKEOVER GAME
49fc040b IT WILL ASK SOME POINTED QUESTIONS IS THERE VALUE ADDED IN CORPORATE MERGERS
49fc040c DOES PRODUCTIVITY INCREASE AND WHAT HAPPENS TO THE PEOPLE INVOLVED
49fc040d THE PREMIER SAID IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR MR. GHAFAR TO REMAIN AS HIS DEPUTY
49fc040e I HAVE TRUST IN HIM
49fc040f I CHOSE HIM DIDN'T I
49fc040g DOCTOR MAHATHIR SAID
49fc040h <NOISE> S. D. I. PERPETUATES THE ILLUSION THAT MORE WEAPONS EQUALS MORE SECURITY
49fc040i OUR DEPENDENCE UPON VIOLENCE TO RESOLVE CONFLICT IS A SHORT RUN SOLUTION TO A LONG TERM PROBLEM
49fc040j IN ORDER TO ENSURE OUR SURVIVAL WE MUST CHANGE THE WAY WE THINK ABOUT CONFLICT
49fc040k BY SPENDING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON DEVELOPING NONVIOLENT MEANS OF RESOLVING CONFLICT WE CAN BUILD A WORLD BEYOND WAR AND A SUSTAINABLE SECURE FUTURE FOR ALL PEOPLE
49fc040l <NOISE> STEVEN M. KINCAID PRESIDENT SAID KINCAID'S BOARD WOULD REVIEW THE ANNOUNCEMENT WHEN IT MEETS SOMETIME IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS

49fc040s <NOISE> AVAILABLE IN THE U. S. SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO GEMFIBROZIL GAINED ONLY LIMITED USE
49fc040t THAT IS BECAUSE GEMFIBROZIL ONLY MODERATELY REDUCES L. D. L. COMPARED WITH OTHER DRUGS

49fc0410 A COMPOSITE QUOTATION DISPLAY SYSTEM SOON FOLLOWED ALLOWING CUSTOMERS AND BROKERS TO SEE QUOTES FROM ALL MARKETS ON A SINGLE SCREEN
49fc0411 AND AN INTERMARKET TRADING SYSTEM ALLOWED ORDERS COMING TO VARIOUS EXCHANGE FLOORS TO FLOW FROM ONE EXCHANGE TO ANOTHER QUICKLY EASILY AND AT NO COST

49gc0201 KIDDER PEABODY FOUNDED FOUR YEARS EARLIER LONG HAS BEEN A SOCIALLY WELL CONNECTED AND PROFITABLE INVESTMENT BANK
49gc0202 BUT ITS POWER ON WALL STREET EBBED IN RECENT YEARS AS IT WAS OVERTAKEN BY LARGER MORE AGGRESSIVE FIRMS
49gc0203 KIDDER OFFICIALS HAVE RECENTLY HOPED THAT ITS LINK WITH GENERAL ELECTRIC AND G. E.'S LARGE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL WOULD RESTORE IT TO ITS EARLIER PREEMINENCE
49gc0204 WE HAD TO SCOUR THE EARTH TO ACHIEVE THAT SETTLEMENT MR. LIEBMANN SAID
49gc0205 BUT THROUGH IT ALL RALPH WAS CALM AND RATIONAL

49gc020g DAYTON HUDSON MAY GET SOME THINGS IT DIDN'T REQUEST FROM THE MINNESOTA LEGISLATURE
49gc020h SOME POLITICAL LEADERS ARE DISCUSSING WHETHER TO AMEND THE DAYTON HUDSON PROPOSAL TO BAN SUCH CONTROVERSIAL MANAGEMENT TAKEOVER DEFENSES AS GOLDEN PARACHUTES POISON PILLS AND GREENMAIL PAYMENTS
49gc020i THIS SHOULD BE A TWO WAY STREET SAID MICHAEL HATCH COMMISSIONER OF THE MINNESOTA COMMERCE DEPARTMENT
49gc020j MANAGEMENTS SHOULDN'T BE ENTRENCHED
49gc020k AN INDEX OF LONG TERM TREASURY BONDS COMPILED BY SHEARSON LEHMAN BROTHERS INC. SANK TO ITS LOWEST LEVEL SINCE JUNE TWO
49gc020l THE INDEX FELL FOUR POINT EIGHT SEVEN POINTS TO TWELVE SIXTY THREE POINT SEVENTY
49gc020m THAT WAS ONLY SLIGHTLY ABOVE ITS LOW FOR THE DAY OF TWELVE SIXTY TWO POINT SIXTY FOUR
49gc020n THE HIGH WAS TWELVE SEVENTY FOUR POINT TWO NINE
49gc020o AND THAT FIGURE DOESN'T INCLUDE GAMBLING REVENUE
49gc020p CASINOS ARE FLUSH WITH HIGH ROLLERS WHEN A BIG FIGHT COMES TO TOWN ENABLING THEM TO RAISE MINIMUM TABLE BETS SKY HIGH
49gc020q IN ATLANTIC CITY IT TOOK ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS TO ELBOW INTO A TRUMP PLAZA CRAPS GAME THE NIGHT OF THE MICHAEL SPINKS GERRY COONEY HEAVYWEIGHT FIGHT IN JUNE
49gc020r MANY BLACKJACK TABLES HAD A MINIMUM BET OF FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS
49gc020s THE RESULT THE AMOUNTS WAGERED THAT MONDAY NIGHT EXCEEDED SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS UP FROM ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR AN AVERAGE MONDAY
49gc020t THAT SAME ORGANIZATION HAS REMAINED IN PLACE EVER SINCE
49gc020u BUSH BRIGADE UNITS HOLD ANNUAL MEETINGS
49gc020v THEY HAVE THEIR OWN NEWSLETTER
49gc020w IT HAS BECOME A KIND OF PRIVATE CLUB WHICH DOLE SUPPORTERS SAY IS BASICALLY ELITIST
49gc020x PORTUGAL'S PRIME MINISTER SAID HIS NATION WANTS TO REVIEW A NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE DEFENSE PACT BUT ISN'T SEEKING A CUT IN U. S. MILITARY FORCES IN THE COUNTRY
49gc020y CAVACO SILVA WHO MET AT THE WHITE HOUSE WITH REAGAN URGED INCREASED AID
49gc020z BUT REAGAN SAID ALL NATIONS HOSTING AMERICAN MILITARY BASES MUST SHARE THE PAIN FROM U. S. BUDGET CUTS
49gc0210 THE ORDER CARRIED OUT THE SHIP TAKES OFF AT FLANK SPEED FROM THE BARENTS HEADED SOUTH TO AVOID DETECTION
49gc0211 THEN INEXPLICABLY A FEW HOURS LATER ALL COMMUNICATION VANISHES
49gc0212 NONE WITH WASHINGTON NONE WITH OTHER SHIPS NO SIGNALS FROM THE USUAL COMMERCIAL STATIONS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD
49gc0213 MOREOVER MR. FAIR'S PREDICTIONS TEND TO IMPROVE WITH AGE
49gc0214 BACK IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX HE WAS GIVING PRESIDENT FORD THE INCUMBENT'S FOUR POINT ADVANTAGE
49gc0215 AFTER THE ELECTION HE TOOK IT AWAY
49gc0216 UNLIKE LYNDON JOHNSON MR. FORD WASN'T EVER ELECTED VICE PRESIDENT MR. FAIR EXPLAINS FEEBLY
49gc0217 WHEN MR. FAIR PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF HIS EQUATION TODAY IT STILL SHOWS A FORD VICTORY BUT BY A LESS EMBARRASSING MARGIN
49gc0218 SUCH PLANS MAKE EDUCATORS CRINGE
49gc0219 THEY WORRY THAT A COLLEGE DEGREE COULD BE REDUCED TO A FEW TRIPS TO THE NOTES DEPARTMENT
49gc021a MY GUESS IS THAT IT WILL QUICKLY BECOME WIDESPREAD BECAUSE OF PEER PRESSURE LAMENTS RANDY KNIGHT VICE CHAIRMAN FOR UNDERGRADUATE STUDIES IN OHIO STATE'S PHYSICS DEPARTMENT
49gc021b STANDARD AND POOR'S CORP. PUT THIS PERSONNEL SERVICES CONCERN'S SEVENTY FOUR POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS OF B. PLUS RATED CONVERTIBLE SUBORDINATED DEBT ON CREDITWATCH WITH NEGATIVE IMPLICATIONS
49gc021c THE MOVE FOLLOWS THE DISCLOSURE LAST WEEK THAT INVESTMENT BANKER GIBBONS GREEN VAN AMERONGEN LIMITED PLANS A TWO STEP ACQUISITION OF A SUBSTANTIAL STAKE IN ROBERT HALF
49gc021d A ROBERT HALF OFFICIAL SAID THE COMPANY IS CONVINCED THAT OUR DEBT COVERAGE WILL BE STRONG AND WE DON'T THINK THE RISKS WILL BE UNREASONABLE
49gc021e NOW HIS LAUGHTER IS GONE
49gc021f BECAUSE OF DRUGS HE IS DEAD
49gc021g AND EVERY DAY MY HEART BREAKS A LITTLE MORE
49gc0301 SOURCES CLOSE TO GOLDMAN SACHS SAID THAT FEDERAL MARSHALS HAD ROPED OFF THE FIRM'S TAKEOVER TRADING AREA AND WERE CARTING OFF DOCUMENTS YESTERDAY AFTERNOON
49gc0302 THEY ADDED THAT MR. FREEMAN HADN'T BEEN SUBPOENAED AND THAT THE FIRM HADN'T HAD ANY WARNING THAT ANY GOVERNMENT ACTION WAS IMMINENT
49gc0303 EVERYONE IS IN TOTAL SHOCK SAID ONE EMPLOYEE
49gc0304 BUT WHILE NICKEL AND ESPECIALLY COPPER QUOTES HAVE SINCE REBOUNDED ALUMINUM PRICES HAVE CONTINUED TO TUMBLE
49gc0305 IT SEEMS TO BE IN PEOPLE'S INTEREST TO KEEP THE PRICE DOWN RIGHT NOW SAYS ONE LONDON EXCHANGE TRADER
49gc0306 THIS WILL ULTIMATELY GIVE THEM MORE BUYING OPPORTUNITIES DOWN THE LINE
49gc0307 THE NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO A. B. M. TREATY REQUIRES A REVIEW EVERY FIVE YEARS
49gc0308 COMMUNIQUES ANNOUNCING COMPLETION OF THE FIRST AND SECOND REVIEWS WERE ISSUED ON NOVEMBER FOUR NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN AND NOVEMBER NINE NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO
49gc0309 THE THIRD REVIEW WAS DUE BY OCTOBER THREE NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
49gc030a THE MOST OPTIMISTIC ESTIMATES ARE NOW THAT IT WILL START SOMETIME AFTER THE FIRST OF THE YEAR
49gc030b THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION IN SHORT IS CONSPIRING WITH THE SOVIETS TO VIOLATE THE REVIEW PROVISIONS OF THE TREATY
49gc030c NO ONE SEEMS QUITE SURE HOW THE PUBLISHER JUGGLES HIS ASSETS AMONG HIS VARIOUS COMPANIES WHICH INCLUDE THE PUBLICLY OWNED MAXWELL COMMUNICATION CORP. AND VARIOUS PRIVATE ONES
49gc030d CONTROL OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY AND OF PRIVATE INTERESTS LIKE MIRROR GROUP NEWSPAPERS LIMITED RESTS WITH A FOUNDATION IN LIECHTENSTEIN PERGAMON HOLDING FOUNDATION ABOUT WHICH LITTLE IS DISCLOSED
49gc030e HE SAYS ITS BENEFICIARIES ARE CHARITIES WHICH HE PROMISES TO IDENTIFY SOMEDAY SOON
49gc030f THE OPTIMISM IS WIDESPREAD
49gc030g THE ASSOCIATION SAID FIFTY SEVEN PERCENT PREDICTED NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT WILL BE BETTER THAN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN WHILE ONLY THIRTEEN PERCENT EXPECTED A WORSE YEAR
49gc030h THAT IS THE HIGHEST TOTAL TO FORECAST A BETTER FUTURE YEAR IN DECEMBER SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE WHEN EIGHTY SIX PERCENT WERE EXPECTING STRONGER GROWTH
49gc030i PRESIDENT REAGAN WHO WAS IN DURHAM NORTH CAROLINA WAS CAUTIOUS ABOUT THE SOVIET OFFER
49gc030j I'M WAITING TO SEE WHAT THE CONDITIONS ARE HE SAID
49gc030k A SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL HOWEVER CALLED THE GORBACHEV STATEMENT A !WATERSHED EVENT BECAUSE IT WILL INCREASE EXPECTATIONS AMONG SOVIET PEOPLE FOR WITHDRAWAL
49gc030l REGARDLESS OF HOW THE FOREIGN PURCHASES BEGIN THEY OFTEN INVOLVE THE VERY PARTS THAT MAKE WEAPONS PERFORM
49gc030m FOR EXAMPLE F. M. C. CORP.'S BRADLEY FIGHTING VEHICLE DEPENDS ON A SOPHISTICATED SENSOR SYSTEM FROM THE NETHERLANDS TO INFORM SOLDIERS OF POTENTIAL THREATS AND TARGETS
49gc030n WITHOUT THIS PART TUCKED INTO THE TURRET OF THE ARMORED VEHICLE THE BRADLEY WOULD BE COMPARATIVELY HELPLESS ON THE BATTLEFIELD
49gc030o MR. IACOCCA SAID THAT WHILE THE PRICING ACTIONS INCREASED SALES THEY ALSO SQUEEZED CHRYSLER'S PROFIT MARGINS
49gc030p BUT HE ADDED THAT THE NUMBER THREE U. S. AUTO MAKER MADE A CONSCIOUS DECISION TO SACRIFICE PROFIT FOR A HIGHER MARKET SHARE
49gc030q THAT MOVE IS BEHIND CHRYSLER'S RECENT DECISIONS TO INCREASE PRODUCTION WHICH IN TURN WILL BOOST PROFIT FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR
49gc030r THE CUOMO PLAN DOESN'T STOP AT GOUGING NEW YORK TAXPAYERS AND LONG ISLAND RATEPAYERS
49gc030s FEDERAL TAXPAYERS WILL ALSO CONTRIBUTE
49gc030t THE KEY TO THE DEAL IS THAT LILCO ALSO WOULD GET A TWO POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLAR TAX WRITE OFF FOR SHOREHAM
49gc030u THIS WOULD GUARANTEE THAT THE UTILITY WON'T HAVE TO PAY ANY FEDERAL TAXES FOR AT LEAST A DECADE
49gc030v NEW YORK ALSO WOULD HELP LILCO FLOAT ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN TAX EXEMPT INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT BONDS TO HELP PAY FOR THE CLEANUP
49gc030w MAKE THAT DE INDUSTRIALIZATION BONDS
49gc030x BUT NETWORK OFFICIALS WILL SPEND MONTHS DEBATING C. B. S.'S WISDOM
49gc030y IT'S TIME TO BE AGGRESSIVE SAID MR. PILSON TESTILY TAKING ON REPORTERS AT YESTERDAY'S PRESS CONFERENCE
49gc030z I'M UP HERE STATING THAT C. B. S. HAS ACQUIRED THE RIGHTS AND N. B. C. HASN'T
49gc0310 AT N. B. C. MR. WATSON WAS PHILOSOPHIC IF PRAGMATIC YOU ALWAYS WANT TO BE A WINNER HE SAID
49gc0311 BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO COMMIT SUICIDE AT THE SAME TIME
49gc0312 THE TOTAL CUT WOULD CORRESPOND TO THE AMOUNT OF COFFEE SOLD AND NOT EXCEED EIGHTEEN THOUSAND BAGS
49gc0313 ONE BAG EQUALS SIXTY KILOS
49gc0314 THE ANNUAL GLOBAL EXPORT QUOTA IS FIFTY FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION BAGS
49gc0315 IN ANOTHER TRADE DISPUTE KANSAI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT CORP. HAS COME UNDER ATTACK
49gc0316 JAPAN INSISTS THE COMPANY WHICH IS IN CHARGE OF A NEW AIRPORT AT OSAKA IS PRIVATE AND NOT SUBJECT TO MINISTRY ORDERS
49gc0317 FOREIGNERS SAY THAT IT IS A SEMANTIC ARGUMENT BECAUSE NEARLY FOUR FIFTHS OF THE COMPANY'S EXECUTIVES HAIL FROM GOVERNMENT MINISTRIES
49gc0318 THREE YEARS AGO WHEN THE MOSLEM LEAGUE CAME INTO THE SHARED POWER ARRANGEMENT MR. IJAZ ALI GOT INTO THE PROVINCIAL ASSEMBLY
49gc0319 THERE HE WRUNG THOUSANDS OF RUPEES FROM THE GOVERNMENT TO BUILD ROADS SCHOOLS AND ELECTRIFICATION SYSTEMS IN HIS DISTRICT
49gc031a THE GOVERNMENT'S IDEA WAS TO OUTFLANK THE P. P. P. OPPOSITION THROUGH PUBLIC WORKS
49gc031b DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY THE ARMY PLAYS AN INCALCULABLE ROLE IN KEEPING PAKISTAN'S DISTORTED ECONOMY PERKING
49gc031c MR. JONES THE AUTHOR NOTES THAT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND PAKISTANI HOUSEHOLDS FOUR PERCENT OF THE ECONOMICALLY ACTIVE ONES HAVE SENT YOUNG MEN INTO THE ARMY
49gc031d ADD IN THE HOUSEHOLDS INVOLVED IN SERVICES FOR THE MILITARY AND NEARLY TEN PERCENT OF THE NATION'S HOUSEHOLDS ARE INVOLVED
49gc031e U. S. INTELLIGENCE ABOUT THE TERRORISTS IS CONSIDERED POOR
49gc031f IT HAS PROVEN DIFFICULT TO INFILTRATE SMALL TERRORIST CELLS WHICH OFTEN ARE HELD TOGETHER BY FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS
49gc031g AND DURING THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES LEBANESE TERRORISTS KILLED TWO OF THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY'S TOP MIDDLE EAST OPERATIVES ROBERT AMES AND WILLIAM BUCKLEY
49gc0401 AS MODEST AS THE MEASURES ARE EVEN THEY WON'T BE ADOPTED WITHOUT A STRUGGLE
49gc0402 THE TAX CUTS ACCEPTED BY THE COALITION PARTIES HAVE BEEN LINKED TO CUTBACKS IN FEDERAL SUBSIDIES
49gc0403 SUCH REDUCTIONS COULD RILE SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS AND UNDERMINE PARLIAMENTARY SUPPORT FOR THE ENTIRE TAX PROGRAM
49gc0404 MOREOVER ANY TAX REFORM MUST CLEAR PARLIAMENT'S UPPER HOUSE THE BUNDESRAT WHERE THE RULING CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC UNION CLINGS TO A MAJORITY
49gc0405 <NOISE> SOME BANKS HAVE ALREADY TURNED CERTAIN DEBTS INTO SECURITIES WHICH SO FAR THEY HAVE HELD RATHER THAN SELLING
49gc0406 TO GET AROUND JAPANESE GOVERNMENT LIMITS ON DEBT RESERVES A GROUP OF JAPANESE BANKS TURNED SOME THIRD WORLD DEBT INTO PREFERRED STOCK EARLIER THIS YEAR
49gc0407 AND SHEARSON IS ABOUT TO START MARKETING A MUTUAL FUND TO BANKS THAT WOULD ALLOW THE BANKS TO SWAP PHILIPPINE DEBT FOR EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN THAT COUNTRY
49gc0408 THE JAPANESE STOCK MARKET IS AWASH WITH LIQUIDITY MR. GRANT SAYS
49gc0409 BUT IN JUNE SUDDENLY WITH NO APPARENT DRAINAGE IT WENT DOWN AND KEPT GOING DOWN HE SAYS
49gc040a WHAT IS A MYSTERY TO MR. GRANT AND MANY OTHERS IS THAT THE TOKYO MARKET HAS SINCE STAGED A VIGOROUS REBOUND
49gc040b THE PHILIP MORRIS MAGAZINE ENJOYS BY FAR THE HIGHEST CIRCULATION OF ANY COMPANY MAGAZINE SEVEN POINT TWO MILLION COPIES
49gc040c THE ONLY REQUIREMENT IS THAT YOU HAVE AN ADULT TO RECEIVE THE MAGAZINE SAYS MARY TAYLOR ASSOCIATE PUBLISHER
49gc040d THAT'S NOT BECAUSE OF RACY ARTICLES BUT BECAUSE THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF TRYING TO SNATCH TWELVE AND THIRTEEN YEAR OLDS
49gc040e PHILIP MORRIS IS EVEN CONSIDERING SELLING SPACE TO OUTSIDE ADVERTISERS IT ALREADY RAN AN AD FOR TIME MAGAZINE ON A TEST BASIS IN ITS WINTER NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN ISSUE
49gc040f NON U. S. BORROWERS ALSO REPORTEDLY MAY COME TO MARKET
49gc040g THE REPUBLIC OF AUSTRIA MAY LAUNCH A LONG DATED EUROYEN ISSUE PERHAPS TOTALING EIGHTY BILLION YEN SIX HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS
49gc040h JAPAN FINANCE CORP. FOR A MUNICIPAL ENTERPRISES IS EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE A SEVEN YEAR ISSUE THAT MAY TOTAL TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS EARLY TODAY
49gc040i MITSUI AND COMPANY HAS A MINORITY STAKE IN A LEVERAGED BUY OUT FUND THAT ACQUIRED CONTROL OF JOSEPH HORNE COMPANY IN LATE NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
49gc040j A CHART IN AN EARLIER EDITION INCORRECTLY LISTED MITSUI ITS ROLE AND THE DATE OF THE TRANSACTION
49gc040k IN ADDITION THE CHART OMITTED SEVERAL LARGE RECENT JAPANESE ACQUISITIONS BECAUSE OF A PRODUCTION ERROR
49gc040l THE UNITED NATIONS WHOSE GARBAGE BILL IS FORTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH IS SERVED BY NATIONAL CARTING COMPANY WHICH WON THE PICKUP RIGHTS EIGHT YEARS AGO
49gc040m LAST DECEMBER THE U. N. DIDN'T ATTEMPT TO SOLICIT BIDS
49gc040n IT SIMPLY EXTENDED ITS CONTRACT WITH NATIONAL CARTING
49gc040o SOLICITING BIDS IN THIS PARTICULAR INDUSTRY IS NOT THE WAY TO GO A U. N. SPOKESMAN SAYS IMPLYING THAT IT IS FUTILE
49gc040p A BIG PART OF THE REASON FOR WOOD'S SUCCESS IS THE NEW TECHNIQUES DEVELOPED OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS FOR WOOD PANELS WITH A STEEL CORE
49gc040q BESIDES NARROWING THE PRICE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WOOD AND METAL SYSTEMS THESE TECHNIQUES PROVIDED THE PRECISION NEEDED IN DESIGNING PANEL SYSTEMS THAT MUST FIT TOGETHER
49gc040r ALMOST ALL THE MAJOR OFFICE FURNITURE MANUFACTURERS HAVE ACQUIRED THE ABILITY TO MAKE WOOD SYSTEMS IN RECENT YEARS
49gc040s STILL THERE ARE WAYS AROUND THE NO DOCUMENTS DILEMMA
49gc040t SAYS DAVIS DWYER <NOISE> A WINTHROP GROUP MANAGING DIRECTOR MY FIRST STOP IS TO GO TO THE FACTORY AND SAY WHO IS THE BUFF
49gc040u THERE'S ALWAYS A BUFF
49gc040v IN ONE CASE HE FOUND AN EMPLOYEE WHO HAD SAVED EVERY COPY OF THE COMPANY'S IN HOUSE MAGAZINE FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS
49gc040w THE WHOLE ENVIRONMENT HAS CHANGED HE SAYS
49gc040x WE HAVE A LOT MORE OPTIONS THAN WE DID BEFORE
49gc040y HE'S PLANNING ON SPENDING SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS ON ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION THIS YEAR COMPARED WITH A COUPLE OF MILLION DOLLARS IN THE PAST
49gc040z CONDOM SALES FOR THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY WERE UP TWENTY SEVEN PERCENT FOR THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDED IN APRIL
49gc0410 CARTER WALLACE'S SHARE AMOUNTS TO OVER FIFTY PERCENT OF THE TOTAL MARKET
49gc0411 ONE OF THE FOUR BUSINESSES INCLUDED IN THE LOCKUP OPTION GRANTED TO K. K. R. IS MACMILLAN'S DIRECTORY DIVISION WHICH CONSISTS OF WHO'S WHO AND NATIONAL REGISTER PUBLISHING
49gc0412 THUS IT WASN'T IMMEDIATELY CLEAR WHY INTERNATIONAL THOMSON MIGHT BE LOOKING AT THE OPERATION EVEN THOUGH IT IS INCLUDED IN THE LOCKUP OPTION
49gc0413 A SPOKESMAN FOR K. K. R. ALSO DECLINED COMMENT
49gc0414 LAST YEAR AFTER WORLD STOCK PRICES CRASHED THE MARKET FOR DOMESTIC JAPANESE CONVERTIBLE BONDS FELL BRIEFLY
49gc0415 BY THE START OF THIS YEAR CONVERTIBLE ISSUES WITH A PAR VALUE OF MORE THAN FOUR TRILLION YEN WERE TRADING AT BELOW THEIR ISSUE PRICE
49gc0416 THEY QUICKLY RECOVERED THOUGH THANKS TO A BOOM IN THE STOCK MARKET AND THE RELATIVELY RELAXED RATE OF NEW CONVERTIBLE BOND ISSUES
49gc0417 THE U. S. HAS BEEN ASKING DAMASCUS FOR HELP BUT THE RESULTS HAVE BEEN DISAPPOINTING
49gc0418 WE'RE JUST A LITTLE BIT EXASPERATED SAYS A SENIOR U. S. OFFICIAL
49gc0419 THEY AREN'T DOING ALL THEY COULD DO
49gc041a AVIATION INSURANCE IS UNDER INTENSE PRESSURE
49gc041b THE GLOBAL AIRLINE PREMIUMS HAVE DROPPED TO ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FROM ABOUT ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
49gc041c MEANWHILE AIRLINE LOSSES IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT ROSE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE PREVIOUS YEAR
49hc0201 AT THIS POINT COMPETING DEVELOPERS WERE EYEING THE PROJECT
49hc0202 UNDER ITS GROUND LEASE WITH THE CITY AND STATE THE PARTNERSHIP MIGHT BE FOUND IN DEFAULT ON ITS CONTRACT ENABLING A COMPETING DEVELOPER TO TAKE OVER
49hc0203 TO STAVE OFF AN ATTACK MR. HARRISON SAYS OUR POSITION WAS THAT WE WERE NEVER IN DEFAULT ON OUR LEASE
49hc0204 WE MAINTAIN THAT THE BANK STOPPED FUNDING
49hc0205 I'M POSITIVE ON THE MOVE TO HIS NEW POST MR. RHINES SAID
49hc0206 I GREW UP IN THE SEMICONDUCTOR GROUP
49hc0207 MR. RHINES HELD A NUMBER OF POSITIONS IN THE COMPANY'S SEMICONDUCTOR OPERATIONS BEFORE TAKING THE DATA SYSTEMS JOB IN EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE
49hc0208 THE F. C. C. REJECTED PETITIONS FROM SEVERAL PARTIES MAINTAINING THAT THE STATIONS SHOULD BE SOLD TO SOMEONE WITH CLOSER TIES TO THE HISPANIC COMMUNITY THAN HALLMARK
49hc0209 HALLMARK HOWEVER HAS SAID IT WOULD CONTINUE THESE STATIONS IN THE SPANISH LANGUAGE FORMAT
49hc020a THE F. C. C. SAID THE CONCERNS OVER FUTURE PROGRAMMING WERE IRRELEVANT TO THE TRANSFER
49hc020b THESE ARE THE REALITIES OF SOUTH AFRICA SAYS MR. DE BEER
49hc020c HIS EYEBROWS ARCH ONCE AGAIN
49hc020d WHAT DO WE DO
49hc020e ROBERT MCCLEMENTS JUNIOR CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER SAID SUN CONTINUES TO SEEK AN ACQUISITION THAT WILL PROVIDE THE RIGHT MIX OF ASSETS
49hc020f A SPOKESMAN FOR THE COMPANY SAID SUN IS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING LARGE IN THE AREA OF ENERGY RESERVES
49hc020g THE SPOKESMAN SAID SUN HAS MORE THAN ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN CAPITAL THAT IT HAS GAINED FROM SPINOFFS AND DIVESTITURES OF COMPANIES OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS
49hc020h NO FINAL BUDGET DECISIONS HAVE BEEN MADE AT THE WHITE HOUSE
49hc020i BUDGET DRAFTING IS BEHIND SCHEDULE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES WON'T EVEN SEE O. M. B. RECOMMENDATIONS UNTIL LATE THIS WEEK
49hc020j BUT IT'S ALREADY CLEAR THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS INCREASED ITS EMPHASIS ON EDUCATION
49hc020k DOLE STRATEGISTS BELATEDLY SEEM TO BE RECOGNIZING THE URGENCY OF THE SITUATION
49hc020l THEY MET YESTERDAY IN WASHINGTON TO REVIEW THEIR POSITION
49hc020m IT SURPRISED PEOPLE IN THE CAMPAIGN JUST HOW INTENSE THE REACTION WAS TO DOLE'S POSITION SAYS ONE OF THE SENATOR'S TOP CAMPAIGN ADVISERS
49hc020n WHO GOT HER VOTE LAST SEPTEMBER
49hc020o GEN.
49hc020p BUSSI SHE SAYS
49hc020q I THINK WE NEED A HARD HAND
49hc020r FIRST INTERSTATE'S FOURTH QUARTER LOSS RESULTED FROM A PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLION DOLLAR ADDITION TO ITS RESERVES AGAINST POSSIBLE FOREIGN DEBT LOSSES
49hc020s BUT EVEN WITHOUT THE RESERVES THE COMPANY SAID EARNINGS WOULD HAVE BEEN FLAT AT ABOUT EIGHTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS COMPARED WITH THE YEAR EARLIER QUARTER
49hc020t FIRST INTERSTATE HAD A SLIGHT DECLINE IN EARNINGS ASSETS AND NEGLIGIBLE GROWTH IN NET INTEREST INCOME
49hc020u NON INTEREST INCOME FELL SEVENTEEN PERCENT PARTLY BECAUSE YEAR EARLIER RESULTS INCLUDED A NINETEEN POINT SIX MILLION DOLLAR PRETAX GAIN ON THE SALE OF A BUILDING
49hc020v PILLSBURY'S LOSS COMPARES WITH EARNINGS OF FORTY EIGHT POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OR FIFTY SIX CENTS A SHARE IN THE YEAR EARLIER QUARTER
49hc020w REVENUE FELL TWO PERCENT IN THE LATEST PERIOD TO ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS FROM ONE POINT FIVE THREE BILLION DOLLARS
49hc020x THE REVENUE DECLINE CAME FROM PILLSBURY'S RESTAURANT BUSINESS
49hc020y THAT'S A BUSINESS DECISION THAT THE MANAGER HAS TO MAKE MR. KEANE SAYS
49hc020z IT'S GOING TO AFFECT HIS RETURN
49hc0210 AND IN THE LONG RUN THE RETURN WILL DECIDE WHETHER THE MANAGER STAYS IN HIS JOB
49hc0211 FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS THE KURDS HAVE STRUGGLED TO ESTABLISH AN INDEPENDENT KURDISTAN IN A TERRITORY THAT STRADDLES PARTS OF TURKEY IRAQ AND IRAN
49hc0212 LIKE THE PALESTINIANS THE WORLD'S TWENTY MILLION KURDS SHARE A RELIGION A CULTURE A LANGUAGE AND A PASSION FOR AUTONOMY
49hc0213 NEARLY HALF LIVE IN TURKEY WHICH REFUSES EVEN TO RECOGNIZE THEM AS A DISTINCT NATIONAL MINORITY AND REFERS TO THEM ONLY AS MOUNTAIN TURKS
49hc0214 THOUGH THE KURDS OUTNUMBER THE PALESTINIANS BY A RATIO OF FIVE TO ONE THE KURDISH CAUSE HAS ATTRACTED LITTLE GLOBAL ATTENTION
49hc0215 <NOISE> MR. MURRAY FORTY NINE YEARS OLD HAD BEEN SCHEDULED TO ASSUME THE POSTS OF CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE ON DECEMBER THIRTY ONE
49hc0216 HE BECAME PRESIDENT IN JANUARY WHEN FLEET FINANCIAL GROUP MERGED WITH NORSTAR BANCORP
49hc0217 FLEET NORSTAR RETAINS HEADQUARTERS IN PROVIDENCE RHODE ISLAND AND IN ALBANY
49hc0218 ONE OF THE FOUR BUSINESSES INCLUDED IN THE LOCKUP OPTION GRANTED TO K. K. R. IS MACMILLAN'S DIRECTORY DIVISION WHICH CONSISTS OF WHO'S WHO AND NATIONAL REGISTER PUBLISHING
49hc0219 THUS IT WASN'T IMMEDIATELY CLEAR WHY INTERNATIONAL THOMSON MIGHT BE LOOKING AT THE OPERATION EVEN THOUGH IT IS INCLUDED IN THE LOCKUP OPTION
49hc021a A SPOKESMAN FOR K. K. R. ALSO DECLINED COMMENT
49hc021b O. T. C. BROKERS ALSO STRESS THAT THEIR STOCKS OFTEN OUTPERFORM LISTED ONES ON A LONG TERM BASIS
49hc021c AND OVERALL THE NASDAQ COMPOSITE INDEX IS UP THIRTEEN PERCENT THIS YEAR TWICE AS MUCH AS THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE
49hc021d ALSO THEY NOTE THE TINY STOCKS THAT GENERALLY TRADE UNDER THREE DOLLARS A SHARE HAVE ALWAYS TAKEN BIG PERCENTAGE MOVES UP OR DOWN WHEN THEY MOVE AT ALL
49hc021e THE MOST WIDELY USED ESTROGEN PRODUCT IN THE U. S. IS SOLD UNDER THE BRAND NAME *PREMARIN* BY AMERICAN HOME PRODUCTS CORP.'S WYETH AYERST LABORATORIES
49hc021f IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT SALES OF *PREMARIN* LARGELY TO PREVENT OSTEOPOROSIS JUMPED TWENTY SIX PERCENT TO TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS
49hc021g A SPOKESWOMAN FOR THE COMPANY SAID *PREMARIN* ISN'T CURRENTLY INDICATED FOR USE IN PREVENTING HEART DISEASE BUT THE COMPANY IS RESEARCHING THE MATTER
49hc0301 IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE ACCIDENT BRITISH AIRWAYS BEGAN CHECKING ITS OTHER JETS FOR CRACKS <NOISE>
49hc0302 IT FOUND CRACKS MORE THAN TWO INCHES LONG IN THIRTY SIX ENGINES ALL OF WHICH IT REMOVED FROM PLANES
49hc0303 EVEN AFTER SPARE ENGINES WERE INSTALLED THIRTEEN JETS WERE GROUNDED
49hc0304 WHEN THE MARKET WAS ROARING IT WAS STUPID TO HAVE CASH SAYS THE FUND MANAGER AT A MAJOR JAPANESE TRUST BANK
49hc0305 BUT NOW IT ISN'T SO BAD
49hc0306 AND SALOMON'S MR. NAPIER SAYS EVERYONE IS GETTING INTO CASH RIGHT NOW AND WAITING
49hc0307 HOURS BEFORE THE ARGUMENTS BEGIN LAWYERS AND AIDES REPRESENTING OUTSIDE INVESTORS WILL BEGIN CIRCLING
49hc0308 THEY WILL STAKE OUT CHOICE SEATS NEAR THE EXIT AND PLOT ESCAPE ROUTES TO NEARBY TELEPHONES
49hc0309 ONCE THE HEARING BEGINS THEY WILL HANG ON THE JUDGE'S EVERY WORD
49hc030a A FRENCH PRESS REPORT SAID THE EXPORTS INCLUDE SOPHISTICATED EQUIPMENT FOR MAKING SEMICONDUCTORS
49hc030b IT SAID THE MACHINERY MAY HAVE HELPED THE SOVIETS BUILD ADVANCED COMPUTER MEMORIES FOR SUCH MILITARY PURPOSES AS MISSILE GUIDANCE
49hc030c WESTERN NATIONS HAVE REACHED *AGREEMENTS* INTENDED TO FORBID EXPORTS OF SUCH EQUIPMENT TO THE SOVIETS
49hc030d JUAN CALDERA A SIXTY TWO YEAR OLD AGRICULTURAL WORKER FROM CIUDAD JUAREZ CHIHUAHUA IS OUTSIDE FREDDY'S AT ONE A. M. LOOKING FOR HIS EMPLOYER
49hc030e FOR HIS AMNESTY APPLICATION MR. CALDERA NEEDS THE BOSS'S SIGNATURE TO HELP PROVE THAT HE HAS WORKED IN THE FIELDS FOR AT LEAST NINETY DAYS
49hc030f ACTUALLY MR. CALDERA HAS WORKED IN THE FIELDS FOR ALMOST THIRTY YEARS
49hc030g AMONG THE BIG BASHES THAT DIDN'T SURVIVE WAS FIRST BOSTON CORP.'S YEAR END EXTRAVAGANZA WHICH IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX ENTERTAINED THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED
49hc030h RATHER THAN FUND AN ENCORE THE BROKERAGE FIRM CONTRIBUTED TO THE NEW YORK TIMES NEEDIEST CASES FUND AND THE COALITION FOR THE HOMELESS IN NEW YORK
49hc030i SIMILARLY AT GOLDMAN SACHS AND COMPANY THE DINING ROOM STAFF DID WITHOUT ITS ANNUAL PARTY AND INSTEAD GAVE A LUNCH FOR A GROUP OF HOMELESS CHILDREN
49hc030j WHEN REMINDED OF THE ROLE REVERSALS IRVING'S MR. RICE SAYS THE FACT THAT THE MERGER TALK NEVER WENT FURTHER OBVIOUSLY SHOWS THERE IS NO COMMONALITY
49hc030k A SPOKESMAN FOR MR. BACOT SAYS THIS A LOT HAS HAPPENED IN BANKING AND THE FINANCIAL MARKETS IN THE INTERVENING YEARS
49hc030l THE RELEVANCE OF THOSE COMMENTS TO TODAY'S CIRCUMSTANCES ISN'T VERY GREAT
49hc030m MR. REAGAN VIGOROUSLY DEFENDED ATTORNEY GENERAL EDWIN MEESE WHO IS UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR HIS ROLE IN ADVANCING A MIDDLE EAST OIL PIPELINE ADVOCATED BY ONE OF MR. MEESE'S FRIENDS
49hc030n MR. REAGAN SAID HE COULDN'T REMEMBER BEING TOLD ANYTHING ABOUT THE PIPELINE AND EXPRESSED EVERY CONFIDENCE IN MR. MEESE'S INTEGRITY
49hc030o HE ALSO CRITICIZED THE LYNCH MOB ATMOSPHERE THAT HAS ACCOMPANIED INVESTIGATIONS OF HIS AIDES
49hc030p IN THE TWO SELECTED AREAS THE STATE WILL ALLOW PROCUREMENT AND RETAIL PRICES TO RISE TO WHAT THE OPEN MARKET DEMANDS
49hc030q THE SUBSIDY FOR CONSUMERS IS MEANT TO REDUCE THE STRAIN ON URBAN RESIDENTS
49hc030r FARMERS OF COURSE WILL GET HIGHER PRICES FOR THEIR GRAIN FROM THE MARKET WHICH IN TURN SHOULD INDUCE THEM TO INCREASE PRODUCTION
49hc030s GRAIN PRODUCTION THROUGHOUT CHINA HAS FALTERED IN RECENT YEARS IN PART BECAUSE STATE PROCUREMENT PRICES WERE TOO LOW
49hc030t MEANWHILE SHARE PRICES CLOSED HIGHER IN SYDNEY HONG KONG WELLINGTON SEOUL AND MANILA AND WERE LOWER IN SINGAPORE
49hc030u TRADING WAS DESCRIBED AS LIGHT TO MODERATE
49hc030v THE TAIPEI MARKET WAS CLOSED
49hc030w GRAINS AND SOYBEANS THE THREAT OF RAIN AND FAVORABLE SPRING PLANTING CONDITIONS PUSHED SOYBEAN AND CORN FUTURES PRICES LOWER
49hc030x THE LATEST WEATHER FORECAST CALLS FOR FAIRLY GOOD MOISTURE IN MIDWEST FARMING STATES OVER THE NEXT SIX TO TEN DAYS
49hc030y ANALYSTS SAID TRADERS ARE SHIFTING THEIR EMPHASIS AWAY FROM LAST YEAR'S CROP AND TO THIS YEAR'S
49hc030z WITH THIS YEAR'S SMALL ACREAGE INCREASES WEATHER AND SPRING PLANTING CONDITIONS ARE MAJOR CONCERNS TO A MARKET THAT IS BEGINNING TO SHAKE OFF A HUGE SURPLUS
49hc0310 THE FAVORABLE CONDITIONS HELPED THE SOYBEAN CONTRACT FOR NOVEMBER SETTLEMENT CLOSE AT SIX POINT EIGHT TWO TWO FIVE DOLLARS A BUSHEL DOWN NINE POINT FIVE CENTS
49hc0311 ANOTHER EXECUTIVE EXPLAINS THE PROBLEMS AS THE OPPOSITE OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
49hc0312 LAST YEAR YOU HAD TUMULTUOUS SWINGS IN THE MARKETS THEMSELVES HE SAYS
49hc0313 THIS YEAR THE ENVIRONMENT WILL BE NARROWER SWINGS BUT VOLUME WILL BE LOWER WITH REVENUES INSUFFICIENT TO COVER COSTS
49hc0314 MORE IMPORTANT THAN ARITHMETIC HOWEVER IS MR. JACKSON'S MESSAGE
49hc0315 SPEAKING TO BLACK ASPIRATIONS HE REPRESENTS THE BEST OF THE AMERICAN DREAM
49hc0316 HE MIGHT EVEN QUALIFY AS A SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE IF NOT FOR HIS ENDORSEMENT OF HOMOSEXUAL RIGHTS
49hc0317 ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE GENERAL STRIKE FACTORIES CLOSED BUT BOOKSTORES REMAINED OPEN IN THIS OLD WORLD CULTURAL CENTER
49hc0318 MOST SCHOOLS WERE SHUT BUT PUSHKIN STREET NEAR THE SQUARE REVERBERATED AS USUAL WITH THE SOUND OF BADLY PLAYED CHOPIN EMANATING FROM THE OPEN WINDOWS OF THE MUSIC ACADEMY
49hc0319 MANY OF THE ARMENIAN DEMANDS ARE CULTURAL
49hc031a THEY WANT THEIR OLD FLAG REINSTATED THEIR CHILDREN SENT TO ARMENIAN SCHOOLS RATHER THAN RUSSIAN ONES THEIR OWN LANGUAGE USED ON OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS
49hc031b THEIR POLITICAL DEMANDS INCLUDE CALLS FOR A SEPARATE ARMY BRIGADE AND THE RIGHT FOR ARMENIA TO HAVE CONSULATES ABROAD
49hc031c THE STUDY WAS PART OF CORNELL'S RESPONSE TO CALLS BY LOCAL POLITICIANS THAT IT SHOULD HELP MORE IN TOMPKINS COUNTY
49hc031d WHEN THE SCHOOLS WERE RANKED BY OPERATING BUDGET OR VALUE OF BUILDINGS CORNELL'S ONE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLAR PAYMENTS WERE FOUND TO BE NEAR THE BOTTOM OF THE LIST

49hc0408 THIS IS SERIOUS STUFF HERE SAYS TOM SCHREYER TWENTY FOUR ADMIRING ONE CONTESTANT
49hc0409 SHE'S GOT TATTOOS AND EVERYTHING
49hc040a STILL SECURITIES AND BANKING REGULATORS WORRY WHETHER THEY ARE ACTING FAST ENOUGH TO SAFEGUARD AGAINST GROWING RISKS IN THE WORLD'S FINANCIAL MARKETS
49hc040b MANY AGREE THERE IS LITTLE TIME TO WASTE IN THE SCRAMBLE TO CREATE BETTER INTERNATIONAL REGULATION
49hc040c AS MR. FELDSTEIN SAYS YOU CAN'T JUST LOOK AT THE BUILDING AND SAY IT HASN'T FALLEN DOWN YET SO WE SHOULD BE SAFE
49hc040d WITH THE INITIAL FINANCING COMPLETE L. S. I. LOOKED ABROAD IN FEBRUARY NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO FOR ITS NEXT INFUSION
49hc040e WE DECIDED TO GO TO INVESTORS WHO'D PAY A HIGHER PRICE EXPLAINS MR. CORRIGAN
49hc040f AT THE TIME EUROPEANS WERE CLAMORING TO INVEST IN U. S. HIGH TECHNOLOGY AND HAD FEW OPPORTUNITIES TO PARTICIPATE DIRECTLY IN GOOD DEALS HE SAYS
49hc040g IF WE LOOK AT THE RECORD THE DEBATE SHOULD BE RATHER SHORT
49hc040h THE WINNERS OBVIOUS
49hc040i THE ONLY TRAGEDY AND IT'S AN AMAZING ONE IS THAT MOST AMERICANS DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED AND HOW IT CAME ABOUT
49hc040j BUT INSIDE ROOM SEVEN THIRTEEN THE JAPANESE SEE THE SITUATION SOMEWHAT DIFFERENTLY
49hc040k THEY REASON LIKE THIS IF THE U. S. IMPOSES SANCTIONS THEY MOST LIKELY WILL BE AIMED AT JAPANESE CONSTRUCTION COMPANIES DOING BUSINESS IN THE U. S.
49hc040l BUT THAT WOULD HURT THOUSANDS OF AMERICAN WORKERS WHO ARE EMPLOYED EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY BY SUCH COMPANIES
49hc040m THE POLITICAL FALLOUT FOR THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION MIGHT BE TOO GREAT TO RISK THAT
49hc040n TORONTO BASED P. C. L. MAKES PACKAGING AND FURNITURE
49hc040o ROBERT J. TWEEDY ITS PRESIDENT SAID THE COMPANY IS LOOKING AT ITS OPTIONS BUT HE DECLINED TO COMMENT FURTHER

49hc040q MR. TANAKA WAS AMONG THE FIRST SCIENTISTS TO RECOGNIZE THE POTENTIAL OF SUPERCONDUCTORS WHICH ARE SUBSTANCES THAT CAN CARRY ELECTRICITY WITH NO RESISTANCE AND THUS NO LOSS OF POWER
49hc040r IF MADE PRACTICAL THEY COULD BRING SPECTACULAR CHANGES TO ALMOST ANY ELECTRICAL PRODUCT OR PROCESS
49hc040s THAT COULD MEAN VASTLY FASTER AND MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT PRODUCTS SUCH AS COMPUTERS CARS AND HOUSEHOLD APPLIANCES
49hc040t BUT UNTIL THE RECENT BREAKTHROUGH SUPERCONDUCTORS HAD TO BE CHILLED TO A HOPELESSLY LOW TEMPERATURE TO WORK SO EXCEPT FOR A FEW APPLICATIONS THERE REALLY WAS NO TECHNOLOGY
49hc040u MR. IACOCCA SAID THAT WHILE THE PRICING ACTIONS INCREASED SALES THEY ALSO SQUEEZED CHRYSLER'S PROFIT MARGINS
49hc040v BUT HE ADDED THAT THE NUMBER THREE U. S. AUTO MAKER MADE A CONSCIOUS DECISION TO SACRIFICE PROFIT FOR A HIGHER MARKET SHARE
49hc040w THAT MOVE IS BEHIND CHRYSLER'S RECENT DECISIONS TO INCREASE PRODUCTION WHICH IN TURN WILL BOOST PROFIT FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR
49hc040x CRITICS ARGUE THAT HE MAY BE OVERLY OPTIMISTIC THOUGH
49hc040y AND MR. DUKAKIS IS CERTAIN TO FACE MORE PRESSURE ON THE QUESTION FROM VICE PRESIDENT BUSH WHO SUPPORTS BOTH THE M. X. AND MIDGETMAN
49hc040z MOREOVER MOST OF THE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS BEING CONSIDERED AS POTENTIAL RUNNING MATES FOR GOVERNOR DUKAKIS HAVE BACKED ONE OR THE OTHER MISSILE PLANS
49hc0410 THE DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION BILL PENDING IN CONGRESS IS EXPECTED TO PUT OFF ANY DECISION UNTIL A NEW ADMINISTRATION TAKES OFFICE NEXT YEAR
49hc0411 STILL MR. LOVE THINKS HE HAS THE WORST BEHIND HIM
49hc0412 PERMIAN HAS BOTTOMED OUT HE SAYS BUT HE'S USING INTERGROUP'S INVESTMENT BANKERS TO SOUND OUT PROSPECTIVE BUYERS ANYWAY
49hc0413 TO BOLSTER THE BALANCE SHEET HE'S ALSO ATTEMPTING TO REACH AGREEMENT LATER THIS YEAR TO SELL TO JAPAN'S N. K. K. THE OTHER HALF OF ITS STEEL HOLDINGS
49hc0414 F. P. L. SAID THE ACQUISITION WOULD BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS A POOLING OF INTERESTS
49hc0415 TURNER OWNS ABOUT TWELVE THOUSAND ACRES IN SOUTHWEST FLORIDA TEN THOUSAND OF WHICH ARE CITRUS GROVES
49hc0416 F. P. L. SAID THE ACQUISITION INCREASES ITS CITRUS ACREAGE TO TWENTY TWO THOUSAND

49hc0419 PRODUCTION IS TO START IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX

49ic020n THE SURVEY'S COMPOSITE INDEX FELL TO FIFTY EIGHT POINT NINE PERCENT IN NOVEMBER FROM OCTOBER'S SIXTY ONE POINT EIGHT PERCENT
49ic020o A FIGURE ABOVE FIFTY PERCENT INDICATES THAT THE ECONOMY IS GENERALLY EXPANDING
49ic020p NOVEMBER MARKS THE SIXTEENTH CONSECUTIVE MONTH OF EXPANSION
49ic020q TRADING THIS WEEK MAY INDICATE THE MARKET'S DIRECTION WITH THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIALS NEAR THE OCTOBER NINETEEN LOW
49ic020r LAST WEEK STOCK PRICES WERE SENT TUMBLING BY SKITTISH INVESTORS MANY OF WHOM ARE CONCERNED WITH STAGFLATION

49ic020y THE THREE TWO MEN AND A WOMAN REPORTEDLY WERE PLANNING A BOMB ATTACK ON A MILITARY PARADE TODAY IN THE BRITISH COLONY
49ic020z THIS MAY TURN OUT TO BE AN EXTREMELY POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE ALL OF THE TOBACCO MANUFACTURERS WERE INVOLVED IN THE ALLEGED CONSPIRACY MR. DAYNARD SAID
49ic0210 THERE IS A LOT OF DAMNING EVIDENCE
49ic0211 NOW THE JURY CAN CONSIDER ALMOST ALL THE EVIDENCE THAT CAME IN ABOUT DEFENDANTS' ATTEMPTS TO STONEWALL AND DENY
49ic0212 THE FLIPPERS APPARENTLY WAITED THE TWO WEEKS THEN DUMPED THEIR SHARES WHEN TRADING OPENED IN THE STOCK
49ic0213 THE FLIPPERS IN THE INDUSTRY WERE HUNGRIER TO DO THIS THAN EXPECTED AN EXECUTIVE CLOSE TO THE DEAL SAYS
49ic0214 THEY WERE ABLE TO BORROW MONEY
49ic0215 ANALYSTS SAY THERE IS A STRONG CHANCE THAT KAO WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF AN EARLIER U. S. ACQUISITION
49ic0216 LAST YEAR IT BOUGHT HIGH POINT NORTH CAROLINA BASED HIGH POINT CHEMICAL CORPORATION FOR AN UNDISCLOSED SUM
49ic0217 HIGH POINT PRODUCES RAW MATERIALS FOR TOILETRIES AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS
49ic0218 I HAVE NEVER SOUGHT EITHER WILLFULLY OR OTHERWISE TO EVADE INCOME TAX MR. SEOW SAID
49ic0219 MR. SEOW SAID IN AN INTERVIEW YESTERDAY THAT IF CONVICTED HE COULD FACE A PRISON SENTENCE
49ic021a <NOISE> HE REPEATED HIS VOW TO STAND FOR PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS EXPECTED LATER THIS YEAR

49ic021d <NOISE> HE STILL HAS HALF OF LAST YEAR'S HARVEST IN STORAGE EVEN THOUGH HE WILL START HARVESTING THIS YEAR'S CROP THIS WEEK
49ic021e <NOISE> I WANTED TO SPECULATE HE EXPLAINS
49ic0301 WHILE ALL WEST GERMAN POLITICAL PARTIES AGREED ON THE NEED FOR TAX CUTS OF ABOUT TWENTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS THEY DIFFER ON WHO SHOULD BENEFIT
49ic0302 THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATS AND THE LEFT WING GREENS WANT THE CUTS TO HELP THE POOR AND THE WORKING CLASS
49ic0303 WITHIN THE RULING COALITION THE LIBERAL FREE DEMOCRATS AND THE BAVARIAN SISTER PARTY OF THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS THE CHRISTIAN SOCIALISTS WANT CUTS SPREAD ACROSS THE BOARD
49ic0304 MR. FUNARO DESCRIBED AS HOT AIR AND NONSENSE FOREIGN BANKERS' LANGUAGE IN THEIR CRITICISM OF BRAZIL'S LACK OF ECONOMIC POLICY
49ic0305 HE SAID NOBODY WORRIED ABOUT BRAZIL'S HIGH INFLATION WHEN THE COUNTRY WAS PRODUCING BIG SURPLUSES TO MEET DEBT PAYMENTS
49ic0306 INSTEAD OF LOOKING FOR EXCUSES HE SAID THESE BANKS SHOULD REALIZE THERE'S A DEBT CRISIS AND IT HAS TO BE RESOLVED BY BOTH SIDES
49ic0307 KIDDER PEABODY WAS FINED TWENTY FIVE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS BY THE S. E. C. TO SETTLE INSIDER TRADING AND OTHER CHARGES
49ic0308 THE PENALTY IS SECOND ONLY TO IVAN BOESKY'S ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR FINE LAST FALL
49ic0309 KIDDER'S SETTLEMENT THE FIRST BY A MAJOR FIRM IN THE INSIDER TRADING SCANDAL WILL ALLOW THE G. E. SUBSIDIARY TO ESCAPE CRIMINAL PROSECUTION
49ic030a EVEN SO GLORIA HAS ALREADY GIVEN UP HOPE
49ic030b I HEAR THAT ONLY PEOPLE WITH MONEY WILL BE APPROVED SHE SAYS
49ic030c MY MOTHER TELLS HER IT ISN'T TRUE TO BE PATIENT
49ic030d THE FIRM DOLLAR ALSO BOOSTED PRICES IN ZURICH AND ENCOURAGED SELECTIVE BUYING BY FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC INVESTORS DEALERS SAID
49ic030e <NOISE> SOME FINANCIAL CHEMICAL AND OTHER INDUSTRIAL STOCKS HAD THE BIGGEST GAINS
49ic030f BANKS ALSO ENDED MOSTLY HIGHER
49ic030g MEANWHILE MR. SILVA HERZOG BORROWED A FRIEND'S UNMARKED OFFICE IN CENTRAL MEXICO AND DISCREETLY RECEIVED VISITORS
49ic030h <NOISE> HE TURNED DOWN JOB OFFERS FROM COMPANIES AND INTERNATIONAL LENDING AGENCIES BUT ACCEPTED LECTURING ENGAGEMENTS ABROAD
49ic030i <NOISE> HE THOUGHT ABOUT OPENING A U. S. LATIN AMERICA STUDIES CENTER IN MEXICO CITY OR SETTING UP A CONSULTING FIRM
49ic030j WHAT HAPPENS NOW
49ic030k <NOISE> THAT DEPENDS ON TWO THINGS WHETHER MANAGEMENT CAN GAIN THE TRUST OF THE WORKERS AND WHETHER UNION LEADERS CAN CONTROL THE RANK AND FILE
49ic030l IT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD ON EITHER COUNT
49ic030m INDEED LABOR EXPERTS SAY THERE IS ONLY A SLIM CHANCE THAT SOUTH KOREA CAN LAY A FOUNDATION FOR LABOR RELATIONS THAT MIGHT CALM WORKER UNREST SOON
49ic030n <NOISE> TURNOUT IS ANOTHER UNKNOWN FACTOR
49ic030o TO CAPITALIZE HERE GOVERNOR DUKAKIS WOULD LIKE TO SEE A HEAVY TURNOUT ESPECIALLY IN SUCH POCKETS OF STRENGTH AS THE CHICAGO LAKEFRONT AND SUBURBS
49ic030p <NOISE> BUT THAT MAY NOT HAPPEN ILLINOIS REGISTRATION IS BELOW NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR AND NO PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE HAS YET CAUGHT FIRE

49ic030t WE SEEM TO BE READY TO TAKE A LITTLE REST SAID ONE PARTICIPANT
49ic030u I DON'T THINK PEOPLE ARE EITHER SCREAMINGLY WORRIED OR SCREAMINGLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS MARKET SAID ANOTHER
49ic030v I THINK THE ATTITUDE HAS GOT TO BE THAT WE'VE BEEN OUTPERFORMING THE OTHER WORLD MARKETS AND NOW THE OTHER MARKETS MAY BE OUTPERFORMING THIS ONE A LITTLE
49ic030w JULY PLATINUM ROSE TEN DOLLARS AND THIRTY CENTS AN OUNCE TO FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN DOLLARS
49ic030x JULY SILVER ADVANCED EIGHT POINT FIVE CENTS AN OUNCE TO SEVEN POINT ONE FIVE FIVE DOLLARS
49ic030y AUGUST GOLD GAINED ONE DOLLAR AND TWENTY CENTS AN OUNCE TO FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIVE DOLLARS AND EIGHTY CENTS
49ic030z ALL THREE METALS TRADED HIGHER AT VARIOUS POINTS IN THE DAY BUT LATE PROFIT TAKING TRIMMED THE ADVANCES
49ic0310 BUT MR. PARCHER IS ALSO CONSIDERED ABRASIVE AT TIMES
49ic0311 HE RUBS SOME PEOPLE WRONG SAYS LEONARD MARKS WHO HAS TRIED CASES AGAINST HIM
49ic0312 HE'S VERY OUTSPOKEN
49ic0313 LAWRENCE SUMMERS ECONOMIC ADVISER TO GOVERNOR DUKAKIS ARGUES THAT EVEN THE BEST FIGURES PROVIDE A DISCOURAGING PICTURE OF THE ECONOMY
49ic0314 <NOISE> IT USED TO BE THAT STANDARDS OF LIVING ROSE RELIABLY HE SAYS REFERRING TO THE NINETEEN FIFTIES AND NINETEEN SIXTIES
49ic0315 BUT THE PACE IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES HAS BEEN NEGATIVE BY MY PREFERRED MEASURE AND GLACIAL BY ANY OTHER
49ic0316 STILL THE NEURAL NETWORK REPRESENTS A REMARKABLE CONCEPTUAL LEAP IN THE COMPUTER WORLD
49ic0317 IT IS A CRITICAL BUILDING BLOCK IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE MUCH AS THE NEURONS IN HUMANS ARE THE VEHICLE FOR BRAIN FUNCTION
49ic0318 THE NETWORK HAS ALLOWED RESEARCHERS TO CREATE THE FIRST CONVINCING LIKENESS OF THE BRAIN IN AREAS SUCH AS MEMORY AND VISION
49ic0319 <NOISE> DESPITE THE PROBLEMS WITH THE CLARIDGE MR. WYNN DIDN'T RULE OUT AN EVENTUAL RETURN TO: THE ATLANTIC CITY GAMBLING SCENE
49ic031a <NOISE> IT'S DISAPPOINTING HE SAID OF THE FAILED PROPOSAL
49ic031b BUT THIS IS A VERY LIVELY MARKET AND WE HAVEN'T GIVEN UP YET
49ic031c THE KREMLIN WHICH LONG DENIED THAT THERE WERE POLITICAL PRISONERS HERE NOW CONCEDES THEY DO EXIST
49ic031d THE MOST RECENT OFFICIAL SOVIET ESTIMATES PUT THE TOTAL BETWEEN TWELVE AND TWENTY NINE
49ic031e MOSCOW DEFINES POLITICAL PRISONERS AS PEOPLE SENTENCED UNDER TWO ARTICLES OF THE SOVIET CRIMINAL CODE THAT MAKE BEHAVIOR LOOSELY DEFINED AS ANTI SOVIET A CRIMINAL OFFENSE
49ic031f BOTH ARTICLES OF THE CODE WERE WIDELY USED IN LOCKING UP DISSIDENTS IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES
49ic0401 AD AGENCIES IN THE PAST HAVE TYPICALLY RECEIVED AS COMMISSIONS FIFTEEN PERCENT OF AN ADVERTISER'S BILLINGS THE TOTAL COST OF PLACING ADS

49ic0403 <NOISE> AYER HAD NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE BILLINGS OF EIGHT HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS
49ic0404 THE DIET IS A ONE HOUSE LEGISLATURE APPORTIONED BY DISTRICT RATHER THAN POPULATION LIKE THE SENATE AS OPPOSED TO THE HOUSE
49ic0405 THIS MEANS THAT JAPANESE FARMERS HAVE TREMENDOUS CONTROL OVER JAPANESE POLITICS
49ic0406 FOOD PRICES IN JAPAN TAKE FORTY PERCENT OR MORE OF THE AVERAGE PERSON'S WAGE
49ic0407 WITH HOUSING TAKING ANOTHER FORTY PERCENT AND THE FACT THAT THE JAPANESE ARE GREAT SAVERS THEY ARE LEFT WITH ALMOST NO DISCRETIONARY INCOME
49ic0408 THIS IS WHY THEY CANNOT DEVELOP A DOMESTIC MARKET
49ic0409 THEY DON'T HAVE MONEY TO SPEND EXCEPT A SMALL AMOUNT OF SAVINGS THAT THEY SPEND ONLY ON SPECIAL OCCASIONS OR FOR UNUSUAL BARGAINS
49ic040a CRAY ALREADY HAS SOLD TWO OF THE NEW COMPUTERS

49ic040g IN ITS OFFER BATUS SIGNALED THAT THE APPROVAL PROCESS MAY TAKE MONTHS
49ic040h IN RECENT MONTHS THE QUOTA PROGRAM ITSELF HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY CONTROVERSIAL
49ic040i SOME BIG U. S. STEELMAKERS WHICH SELL SEMIFINISHED STEEL IN THE DOMESTIC MARKETPLACE ARE FIGHTING TO CONTINUE QUOTAS AFTER THEIR SCHEDULED EXPIRATION SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH
49ic040j OTHERS THOUGH DEPENDENT ON OUTSIDE SUPPLIES OF SEMIFINISHED ARE PUSHING TO END QUOTAS
49ic040k IF THE EXTRADITION EFFORT FAILS THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT LOSES MORE THAN THE CHANCE TO PROSECUTE A KEY SUSPECT
49ic040l IT ALSO COULD LOSE ACCESS TO AN IMPORTANT SOURCE OF EVIDENCE AGAINST OTHER ACCUSED INDIVIDUALS
49ic040m FIVE OTHER PROMINENT BRITISH BUSINESSMEN INCLUDING FORMER GUINNESS CHAIRMAN ERNEST SAUNDERS HAVE BEEN ARRESTED AND CHARGED AS PART OF THE GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATION

49ic040p A FEW PEOPLE GIGGLED NERVOUSLY YOU COULD TELL THEY'D BEEN THINKING THE SAME THING THEMSELVES

49ic040x THE MARKET'S BULLISH MOMENTUM IS STILL INTACT TRADERS SAID CITING A FLURRY OF LATE BUY ORDERS
49ic040y AFTER YESTERDAY'S VOTE MR. MULRONEY WOULDN'T SAY WHETHER HE WOULD TAKE ANY ACTION AGAINST THE OTHER EIGHT TORIES WHO VOTED AGAINST THE BILL

49ic0411 STATE PRE EMPTION WAS PROTESTED BY LESLIE GAINER A LOBBYIST FOR THE U. S. PUBLIC INTEREST GROUP WHICH REPRESENTS CONSUMERS
49ic0412 IT'S A REAL SLAP IN THE FACE OF STATE LEGISLATORS SHE SAID
49ic0413 SHE ALSO COMPLAINED THAT FULL DISCLOSURE ISN'T IMMEDIATELY REQUIRED IN CREDIT CARD SOLICITATIONS ON THE TELEPHONE OR IN MAGAZINES CATALOGS AND FLYERS
49ic0414 YET SHE PRAISED THE BILL FOR ENHANCING THE DISCLOSURE MADE IN MOST STATES
49ic0415 STANDARD AND POOR'S CORPORATION PUT THIS PERSONNEL SERVICES CONCERN'S SEVENTY FOUR POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS OF B. PLUS RATED CONVERTIBLE SUBORDINATED DEBT ON CREDITWATCH WITH NEGATIVE IMPLICATIONS
49ic0416 THE MOVE FOLLOWS THE DISCLOSURE LAST WEEK THAT INVESTMENT BANKER GIBBONS GREEN VAN AMERONGEN LIMITED PLANS A TWO STEP ACQUISITION OF A SUBSTANTIAL STAKE IN ROBERT HALF
49ic0417 A ROBERT HALF OFFICIAL SAID THE COMPANY IS CONVINCED THAT OUR DEBT COVERAGE WILL BE STRONG AND WE DON'T THINK THE RISKS WILL BE UNREASONABLE
49ic0418 MR. GREENSPAN COMPLIED
49ic0419 WHAT HAPPENED THERE IS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT I GATHER IS HAPPENING HERE HE SAID

49ic041b <NOISE> AN UPJOHN SPOKESWOMAN SAID THE COMPANY PLANNED TO MARKET ROGAINE TO WOMEN ALL ALONG
49ic041c HOWEVER F. D. A. APPROVAL FOR USING THE DRUG ON MEN CAME FIRST BECAUSE UPJOHN DIDN'T TEST THE PRODUCT ON ENOUGH WOMEN INITIALLY

49jc020a FOR INVESTORS THE PARTNERSHIPS ARE ONLY AS ATTRACTIVE AS THE UNDERLYING BUYOUTS
49jc020b MANY IN THE FIELD CONTEND THAT THE BUYOUTS BEING PUT TOGETHER THESE DAYS ARE GENERALLY OVERPRICED BECAUSE OF SEVERAL FACTORS
49jc020c AMONG THEM TOO MUCH CAPITAL CHASING TOO FEW GOOD CANDIDATES WHICH HAS PUSHED COSTS UP AND RETURNS DOWN TO WHAT THEY SEE AS UNACCEPTABLE LEVELS
49jc020d THE REVIEW COMMITTEE TRIES TO OFFER A MENU OF SMALL MEDIUM AND LARGE CAPITALIZATION STOCKS
49jc020e SOME OF ITS MOST SUCCESSFUL PICKS WERE QUITE SMALL COMPANIES WHEN FIRST RECOMMENDED
49jc020f MONEY MANAGERS MINDING BILLION DOLLAR PORTFOLIOS ON THE OTHER HAND OFTEN AVOID SMALLER STOCKS BECAUSE THEY CAN'T PURCHASE A SIGNIFICANT STAKE WITHOUT AFFECTING THE PRICE

49jc0303 <NOISE> BUT IN EACH CASE HE SUGGESTS IT'S UP TO THE COUNSEL HE CERTAINLY HAS THE POWERS
49jc0304 ALSO THE STRONG RISE IN SHARE PRICES IN RECENT WEEKS APPEARS TO HAVE DISCOUNTED MOST OF THE GOOD NEWS LIKELY IN THE BUDGET ANOTHER DEALER SAID

49jc0314 THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS TO CONSIDER AND WE'RE LOOKING AT IT
49jc0315 BUT NOTHING IS IMMINENT
49jc0316 <NOISE> IT DOES NOT HOWEVER SEEM REASONABLE TO THE GERMANS WHO ARE INSTEAD MULLING A TAX INCREASE TO SHORE UP A LEAKY GOVERNMENT BUDGET
49jc0317 <NOISE> AS FOR THE U. S. COMMENTS ON GERMAN INFLATION A TYPICAL GERMAN MIGHT RESPOND ZERO INFLATION
49jc0318 WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT
49jc0319 GENERALLY THERE'S NO LIMIT ON HOW MUCH OF THEIR FUNDS EMPLOYEES CAN BORROW IF THEIR ACCOUNTS TOTAL TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS OR LESS

49jc040h THE FIRST IS EXPECTED TO OPEN NEXT YEAR
49jc040i WHAT'S MORE <NOISE> A FURTHER DROP IN THE DOLLAR COULD HAVE THE VERY RESULT MR. BAKER SEEKS TO AVOID HIGHER INTEREST RATES
49jc040j IN ORDER TO KEEP PERSUADING FOREIGN INVESTORS TO HOLD CHEAPER DOLLARS THE FEDERAL RESERVE MUST KEEP U. S. INTEREST RATES HIGHER THAN THOSE ABROAD
49jc040k AN EVEN WEAKER DOLLAR COULD REQUIRE HIGHER RATES
49jc040l <NOISE> UNDER TERMS OF THE ORIGINAL AGREEMENT COMPUTER MEMORIES WOULD HAVE ISSUED NEW SHARES OF ITS OWN IN EXCHANGE FOR SHARES OF CLOSELY HELD HEMDALE
49jc040m CURRENT HEMDALE HOLDERS THEN WOULD HAVE OWNED ABOUT SEVENTY EIGHT PERCENT OF COMPUTER MEMORIES' SHARES

49jc040o A SPOKESMAN FOR CRAY DESCRIBED THE M. I. T. DECISION AS GOOD NEWS
49jc040p ASSUMING THE BIDDING DOES OPEN UP AGAIN IT MEANS THERE'S ROOM FOR TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND NOT CONSIDERATIONS BASED PURELY ON PRICE

49jc040y THAT TRANSLATES INTO A SEASONALLY ADJUSTED ANNUAL RATE OF EIGHT POINT ONE MILLION VEHICLES COMPARED WITH A SEVEN POINT SEVEN MILLION RATE A YEAR EARLIER
49jc040z <NOISE> THIS WEEK'S MID FEBRUARY REPORT ON CAR SALES WILL TELL WHETHER THAT PACE WAS BEING MAINTAINED
49jc0410 OF COURSE TO A GREAT EXTENT THE STOCK PRICES OF THE VARIOUS COMPANIES THAT WILL BE REPORTING HIGHER EARNINGS ALREADY REFLECT SHAREHOLDER EXPECTATIONS
49jc0411 THAT OBVIOUSLY WILL MUTE THE PRICE MOVEMENT OF ANY PARTICULAR STOCK WHEN THE COMPANY REPORTS ITS EARNINGS UNLESS ANALYSTS' ESTIMATES ARE SERIOUSLY OUT OF KILTER

49kc020g THE SENATE IS EXPECTED TO APPROVE IT TODAY
49kc020h ONE OF THE BEST KNOWN INTERNATIONAL STOCK PICKERS JOHN TEMPLETON NEARLY EQUALED THE INDEX WITHOUT ANY JAPANESE STOCKS IN HIS SMALL TEMPLETON FOREIGN FUND

49kc020k HIS LARGER FUNDS WHICH CAN INCLUDE U. S. STOCKS DIDN'T FARE AS WELL
49kc020l TURNOUT IS ANOTHER UNKNOWN FACTOR
49kc020m TO CAPITALIZE HERE GOVERNOR DUKAKIS WOULD LIKE TO SEE A HEAVY TURNOUT ESPECIALLY IN SUCH POCKETS OF STRENGTH AS THE CHICAGO LAKEFRONT AND SUBURBS
49kc020n BUT THAT MAY NOT HAPPEN ILLINOIS REGISTRATION IS BELOW NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR AND NO PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE HAS YET CAUGHT FIRE
49kc020o THE NETWORKS HAVE BEGUN THE DELICATE CRAFT OF SPINNING THE NUMBERS TO THEIR BENEFIT AND OF PUTTING THE BEST SHINE ON A DISMAL TELEVISION SEASON
49kc020p C. B. S. HELD A NEWS BRIEFING LAST FRIDAY
49kc020q A. B. C. HOSTS ONE TODAY N. B. C. WILL DO SO TOMORROW
49kc020r SOME RULES GOVERNING THE ABILITY TO STAY IN BUSINESS TAKES EFFECT FRIDAY
49kc020s BUT PROFESSOR PENNINGTON SAYS IT WILL BE TWELVE MONTHS BEFORE BUSINESSES BEGIN TO LOSE THEIR AUTHORIZATION
49kc020t REGULATORS HE SAYS CAN'T BE TOO HARD ON PEOPLE WHO JUSTIFIABLY CLAIM THEY HAVEN'T HAD TIME TO COMPLY
49kc020u ANYONE WHO ACCEPTS THE JOB OF INVESTIGATING THE SPEAKER SHOULD BE PREPARED TO TAKE SOME HEAT

49kc0210 CONDOM SALES FOR THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY WERE UP TWENTY SEVEN PERCENT FOR THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDED IN APRIL
49kc0211 CARTER WALLACE'S SHARE AMOUNTS TO OVER FIFTY PERCENT OF THE TOTAL MARKET
49kc0212 MR. CHATICHAI'S WEALTHY FAMILY BACKGROUND AND HIS FAMILY'S LARGE PROPERTY INTERESTS GIVE HIM A GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY
49kc0213 FURTHER HE HAS GOOD RELATIONS WITH THE LARGE ETHNIC CHINESE COMMUNITY AND SERVES AS A CHAIRMAN OF THE THAI CHINESE FRIENDSHIP ASSOCIATION
49kc0214 THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE COUNTRY'S BUSINESS ELITE MANY OF WHOM ARE ETHNIC CHINESE
49kc0215 AS A RESULT THE SEQUOIA WON'T BE GOING BACK TO THE U. S. NAVY THIS YEAR
49kc0216 OR PERHAPS ANY YEAR
49kc0217 AND THE SHIP WHICH WAS USED BY EIGHT U. S. PRESIDENTS MIGHT EVEN GO UNDER
49kc0218 THE TREASURY IS SCHEDULED TO ANNOUNCE DETAILS OF ITS QUARTERLY FINANCING OPERATION NOVEMBER SECOND
49kc0219 IT USUALLY CONSISTS OF THREE YEAR NOTES TEN YEAR NOTES AND THIRTY YEAR BONDS
49kc021a BUT THE DEPARTMENT IS VERY CLOSE TO REACHING ITS LIMITS ON ISSUING LONG TERM DEBT AND THUS HAS ASKED THE CONGRESS TO INCREASE ITS AUTHORITY
49kc021b CONGRESS STILL HAS COMPLETED WORK ON THE ISSUE WHICH IS PART OF THE TAX BILL PASSED LATE TUESDAY BY THE SENATE
49kc021c IN RECENT MONTHS SPICER HAS CUT ITS ONE THOUSAND MEMBER U. S. STAFF BY TEN PERCENT IN AN EFFORT TO CUT COSTS
49kc021d MR. BERNSTEIN SAID THAT A MERGER OF THE TWO FIRMS WORLD WIDE WOULD CREATE AN INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION OF ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN ANNUAL REVENUE

49kc0301 IN ADDITION TO THE WAR OF NERVES OVER DISCOUNTS RETAIL EXECUTIVES SAID THIS CHRISTMAS SEASON HAS BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY THE ABSENCE OF A BIG HIT IN THE TOY DEPARTMENT
49kc0302 BUT RETAILERS HAVE SEEN STRONG SALES OF BIG TICKET ITEMS TO WELL HEELED CUSTOMERS
49kc0303 THEY ARE BUYING TO BEAT THE NEW TAX LAW WHICH WILL END THE DEDUCTION OF SALES TAXES AND SOME INTEREST EXPENSES
49kc0304 IT'S ABOUT AS INTERESTING AS YESTERDAY'S TUNA FISH SAID MARYANN KELLER AN AUTO ANALYST WITH FURMAN SELZ MAGER DIETZ AND BIRNEY

49kc0306 I'M NOT SURE HOLDING QUOTAS DOES THEM ANY HARM
49kc0307 MS. BASS WON'T DISCUSS STRATEGY FOR I. MAGNIN
49kc0308 BUT INDUSTRY OBSERVERS SAY I. MAGNIN LIKE OTHER RETAILERS IN TODAY'S SATURATED MARKETS WILL HAVE TO ESTABLISH A MORE FOCUSED IDENTITY
49kc0309 MS. BASS ALSO WILL HAVE TO REASSESS THE VALUE OF SOME OF ITS SCATTERED STORES INCLUDING THOSE IN CHICAGO WASHINGTON AND ARIZONA AND INCREASE SALES VOLUME
49kc030a THAT'S THE ONLY CURE SAYS MARK SHULMAN PRESIDENT OF LIMITED INCORPORATED'S HENRI BENDEL AND A FORMER EXECUTIVE AT I. MAGNIN AND BLOOMINGDALE'S
49kc030b WHILE ALL WEST GERMAN POLITICAL PARTIES AGREE ON THE NEED FOR TAX CUTS FOR ABOUT TWENTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS THEY DIFFER ON WHO SHOULD BENEFIT

49kc030i MR. WALSH'S LEGAL THEORY ABOUT THE FLOW OF FUNDS IS LIKELY TO BE THE LINCHPIN OF AN EFFORT TO BRING BROADER CONSPIRACY AND OTHER CRIMINAL CHARGES
49kc030j CENTRAL TARGETS OF THE INVESTIGATION INCLUDE FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JOHN POINDEXTER FORMER WHITE HOUSE AIDE OLIVER NORTH AND RETIRED AIR FORCE MAJOR GENERAL RICHARD SECORD
49kc030k A FINAL DECISION ON SEEKING CHARGES COULD COME IN SEPTEMBER
49kc030l IN THE TWO SELECTED AREAS THE STATE WILL ALLOW PROCUREMENT AND RETAIL PRICES TO RISE TO WHAT THE OPEN MARKET DEMANDS
49kc030m THE *SUBSIDY* FOR CONSUMERS IS MEANT TO REDUCE THE STRAIN ON URBAN RESIDENTS
49kc030n FARMERS OF COURSE WILL GET HIGHER PRICES FOR THEIR GRAIN FROM THE MARKET WHICH IN TURN SHOULD INDUCE THEM TO INCREASE PRODUCTION
49kc030o GRAIN PRODUCTION THROUGHOUT CHINA HAS FALTERED IN RECENT YEARS IN PART BECAUSE STATE PROCUREMENT PRICES WERE TOO LOW
49kc030p REMEMBER THE ONE ABOUT THE INVESTMENT BANKER
49kc030q IT WAS A WIDELY TOLD CIRCA OCTOBER NINETEEN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN AND WENT LIKE THIS WHAT DO YOU CALL AN INVESTMENT BANKER

49kc030w A YEAR AGO IT SEEMED THAT I. B. M. AND MICROSOFT ALONE WOULD DICTATE THE STANDARDS FOR DESKTOP COMPUTERS IN THE OFFICE

49kc031a THE HOME VIDEO INDUSTRY IS HOPING THE MASSIVE PURCHASES OF BOTH CASSETTES WILL TURN MANY CASSETTE RENTERS INTO AT LEAST OCCASIONAL BUYERS IN THE FUTURE
49kc031b THERE ARE STILL LEGISLATIVE ISSUES TO BE RESOLVED ON THE SENATE FLOOR AND AMONG FOUR HOUSE COMMITTEES BEFORE THE BILL REACHES THE HOUSE FLOOR
49kc031c BUSINESS GROUPS FOR EXAMPLE ARE UNHAPPY AT PROVISIONS REQUIRING BUS COMPANIES TO INSTALL WHEELCHAIR LIFTS AND HANDICAPPED TOILETS IN NEW OVER THE ROAD BUSES
49kc031d THE GROUPS ALSO CRITICIZE THE LACK OF A BLANKET SMALL BUSINESS EXEMPTION FOR PUBLIC ACCOMMODATIONS
49kc031e BUT MANY OTHER BUSINESS OBJECTIONS HAVE BEEN DEALT WITH IN THE WHITE HOUSE SENATE NEGOTIATIONS PRETTY MUCH ELIMINATING THE CHANCES THAT THE MEASURE COULD BE DERAILED
49kc0401 NOW HE SELLS KNOCKOFF GUCCI AND ROLEX WATCHES STARTING AT FIFTY DOLLARS APIECE TO THE SECRETARIES AT HIS PREP SCHOOL
49kc0402 MY STRATEGY IS TO GET THEM ALONE HE S- EXPLAINS

49kc0404 ROBERT E. WUNDERLE VICE PRESIDENT OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS FOR SUPERMARKETS GENERAL SAYS THE COMPANY HAS HELD DISCUSSIONS IN GOOD FAITH WITH THE HAFTS
49kc0405 HE ADDED THAT THE COMPANY IS DISAPPOINTED THAT THE HAFTS HAVE CHOSEN TO PUBLICIZE THE CONTENTS OF A LETTER FILLED WITH HALF TRUTHS AND DISTORTIONS
49kc0406 HE DECLINED TO ELABORATE
49kc0407 MR. JUNGER PREVIOUSLY HAS DENIED ANY WRONGDOING AND HAS SAID HE ISN'T RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CURREN:CY LOSS

49kc040f THEY ADDED THAT THERE'S STILL TIME FOR THE NEW YORK UTILITIES TO SEEK ALTERNATIVE ENERGY SOURCES
49kc040g THE WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY FOR THE CREATION OF SUPERREGIONAL BANKS MIGHT NOT BE OPEN LONG
49kc040h THEN WE WILL FACE THE CHALLENGE OF CONSOLIDATING OUR POSITIONS
49kc040i IT'S GOING TO BE TOUGH
49kc040j WHAT HAS DISTINGUISHED US IS THAT OUR RETURNS ON ASSETS AND EQUITY ARE FAR ABOVE AVERAGE
49kc040k MAINTAINING THOSE LEVELS THAT'S GOING TO BE THE CHALLENGE

49mc030c THAT'S NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF RACY ARTICLES BUT BECAUSE THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF TRYING TO SNATCH TWELVE AND THIRTEEN YEAR OLDS
49mc030d PHILIP MORRIS IS EVEN CONSIDERING SELLING SPACE TO OUTSIDE ADVERTISERS IT ALREADY RAN AN AD FOR TIME MAGAZINE ON A TEST BASIS IN ITS WINTER NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN ISSUE
49mc030e GENERAL RAMOS ALSO CONFIRMED FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT PHILIPPINE AUTHORITIES WERE LOOKING INTO POSSIBLE FOREIGN INVOLVEMENT IN THE COUP ATTEMPT THE ASSOCIATED PRESS REPORTED
49mc030f GENERAL RAMOS SAID THE MILITARY WAS INVESTIGATING THE PRESENCE OF SOME FOREIGN PERSONNEL NEAR ARMED FORCES HEADQUARTERS DURING THE UPRISING
49mc030g HE DECLINED TO ELABORATE
49mc030h NEVERTHELESS SOME ANALYSTS SAY THE FED ALREADY MAY BE TIGHTENING CREDIT SLIGHTLY
49mc030i THEY POINT TO RECENT INCREASES IN THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE WHICH IS THE RATE ON RESERVES THAT BANKS LEND EACH OTHER OVERNIGHT
49mc030j THE FUNDS RATE AVERAGED ABOUT SEVEN AND FIVE EIGHTHS PERCENT YESTERDAY AND TUESDAY UP FROM AN AVERAGE OF SEVEN POINT FOUR THREE PERCENT IN THE WEEK ENDED OCTOBER SEVENTH
49mc030k THESE ANALYSTS ARGUE THAT THE INCREASE WAS ENGINEERED BY THE FED
49mc030l JUDGE BORK'S LIKELY DEFEAT IS A TURNING POINT IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL HISTORY PRECISELY BECAUSE IT IS NOT A TURNING POINT
49mc030m NEVER BEFORE HAS A SUPREME COURT NOMINEE BEEN DEFEATED BECAUSE OF HIS GENERAL APPROACH TO THE CONSTITUTION
49mc030n THIS DEFEAT CONSOLIDATES THE APPROACH TO THE CONSTITUTION THAT HAS BEEN FOLLOWED FOR THE PAST FIFTY YEARS
49mc030o THE EXPERIMENTAL VACCINE IS MADE FROM THE VIRUS FROM WHICH SMALLPOX VACCINE IS MANUFACTURED
49mc030p GENES FROM THE SURFACE PROTEIN OF THE HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS OR H. I. V. WHICH CAUSES AIDS ARE INSERTED INTO SMALLPOX VACCINE VIRUS USING BIOTECHNOLOGY TECHNIQUES

49mc030r CITICORP'S LOSS FOR THE YEAR STEMMED FROM A THREE BILLION DOLLAR ADDITION IN THE SECOND QUARTER TO LOSS RESERVES FOR LOANS TO DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
49mc030s EXCLUDING ONE TIME GAINS AND LOSSES CITICORP'S NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN PROFIT WOULD HAVE BEEN ONE POINT ONE FIVE BILLION DOLLARS
49mc030t EXCLUDED ARE GAINS ON REAL ESTATE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER AND PENSION ASSETS IN THE THIRD QUARTER PLUS THE EFFECT OF THE RESERVE ADDITION
49mc030u THE MOST ACTIVE ISSUE WAS INTEL THE BIG SEMICONDUCTOR COMPANY WHICH ROSE ONE QUARTER TO TWENTY EIGHTH AND ONE QUARTER
49mc030v BUT SOME OTHER BIG ELECTRONICS SHARES SURGED LATE IN THE DAY
49mc030w S. C. I. SYSTEMS CLIMBED THREE QUARTERS TO FOURTEEN AND THREE EIGHTHS ON TWO HUNDRED NINE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED SHARES
49mc030x DOW CHEMICAL COMPANY'S INDUSTRIAL SALES STAFF IS FIFTEEN PERCENT WOMEN UP FROM TEN PERCENT FIVE YEARS AGO
49mc030y AMERICAN NATIONAL INSURANCE COMPANY GALVESTON TEXAS DOUBLED THE SALESWOMEN IT EMPLOYS IN THE SAME PERIOD
49mc030z MCCORMICK AND COMPANY OF HUNT VALLEY MARYLAND SAYS WOMEN ACCOUNT FOR TWENTY NINE PERCENT OF ITS SALES FORCE COMPARED WITH FIFTEEN PERCENT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE
49mc0310 A MCCORMICK'S VICE PRESIDENT ATTRIBUTES WOMEN'S GAINS AT THE COMPANY TO A DEEP ROOTED WORK ETHIC AND A STRONG DESIRE FOR SUCCESS
49mc0311 THE TRADE BILL WOULD DEFEAT PRESIDENTIAL ACTION AGAINST COUNTRIES THAT PERMIT PIRACY OF U. S. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
49mc0312 IT WOULD REQUIRE THE PRESIDENT TO IDENTIFY COUNTRIES THAT DON'T PROTECT COPYRIGHTS AND PATENTS AND TO INITIATE EXPEDITED UNFAIR TRADE INVESTIGATIONS IN THE MOST EGREGIOUS CASES
49mc0313 THE PRESIDENT COULD DECLINE TO MOVE AGAINST CERTAIN COUNTRIES IF DOING SO WOULD BE AGAINST THE NATIONAL ECONOMIC INTEREST THOUGH
49mc0314 CONGRESS WANTS SPEEDY ACTION BECAUSE TIME CAN OFTEN BE CRITICAL IN WINNING PROTECTION FOR CERTAIN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY SUCH AS COMPUTER SOFTWARE WHICH CAN BE COPIED RAPIDLY

49mc0318 WE ARE IN EFFECT OUT OF BUSINESS FOR AWHILE SAID JOHN SCHMIDT CO OWNER OF SCHMIDT AND SCHMIDT INSURANCE ASSOCIATES OF SAN FRANCISCO
49mc0319 THE BROKER SAYS RIGHT NOW WE'VE BEEN TOLD DON'T DO ANYTHING
49mc031a A CLIENT YESTERDAY WHO BOUGHT A NEW CAR COULDN'T DRIVE IT OFF THE LOT HE SAYS BECAUSE HE WAS UNABLE TO INSURE IT
49mc031b MR. MARTENS SAID VITRO WASN'T PREPARED TO AGREE TO THAT CONDITION
49mc031c HE SAID APPARENTLY ANCHOR IS CONCERNED THAT THE INFORMATION IT IS OFFERING TO PROVIDE WILL GIVE VITRO A BASIS FOR LOWERING THE PRICE
49mc031d INDEED THE ACTIONS TAKEN BY ANCHOR GIVE VITRO A BASIS TO LOWER THE BID
49mc0401 IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE ACCIDENT BRITISH AIRWAYS BEGAN CHECKING ITS OTHER JETS FOR CRACKS
49mc0402 IT FOUND CRACKS MORE THAN TWO INCHES LONG IN THIRTY SIX ENGINES ALL OF WHICH IT REMOVED FROM PLANES
49mc0403 EVEN AFTER SPARE ENGINES WERE INSTALLED THIRTEEN JETS WERE GROUNDED
49mc0404 PAINEWEBBER ITSELF HASN'T BEEN CHARGED WITH WRONGDOING
49mc0405 THE FIRM A UNIT OF PAINEWEBBER GROUP INCORPORATED RELEASED A SHORT STATEMENT TODAY IN WHICH IT SAID THE TWO MEN HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED INDEFINITELY
49mc0406 THE FIRM HAS COOPERATED WITH THE U. S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE THROUGHOUT THE INVESTIGATION AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO
49mc0407 MEANWHILE THE AGENCY SAID IT WILL CONDUCT A STUDY OF ITS OWN
49mc0408 OFFICIALS SAID THE REVIEW MAY LEAD TO NEW REGULATIONS FOR DATA PROCESSING SYSTEMS
49mc0409 THE AGENCY MAY ALSO CHALLENGE PAST CHARGES TO THE PENTAGON
49mc040a PENTAGON OFFICIALS SAY THE REVIEW LIKELY WILL TAKE AT LEAST A YEAR
49mc040b IT'S THE LIFE OF A ENTREPRENEUR AND THE FATE OF CREATIVITY IN A MODERN FINANCIALLY ORIENTED AMERICA MR. LUCAS SAYS WARMING TO THE SUBJECT
49mc040c IT'S ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO A SOCIETY WHEN IT GROWS OLD AND TRIES TO KEEP THE STATUS QUO INSTEAD OF LETTING ITS MORE CREATIVE INSTINCTS TAKE OVER
49mc040d ALTHOUGH TUCKER IS SET IN THE NINETEEN FORTIES MR. LUCAS MAKES IT CLEAR HE THINKS THE FILM'S SUBJECT IS CURRENT AND QUITE PERSONAL
49mc040e BULLION DEALERS SAY THE FIVE HOUSES FIXING THE GOLD PRICE HAVE TO RESPOND TO THE NEEDS OF THE MARKET AND REQUIREMENTS OF BRITISH FINANCIAL LEGISLATION
49mc040f AS A GROUP THE FIVE BULLION FIRMS TRANSACT LESS BUSINESS THAN OUTSIDE MARKET MAKERS SEVERAL LONDON BULLION TRADERS SAY
49mc040g UNLIKE GOLD FUTURES MARKETS IN NEW YORK AND CHICAGO HOWEVER THE LONDON GOLD MARKET DOESN'T PUBLISH TRADING STATISTICS
49mc040h SABOTEURS ARE OUR BIGGEST PROBLEM SAYS MR. CAIRO REFERRING TO THE BEVY OF PEOPLE WHO SHIELD THE DEBTOR
49mc040i AT THE OFFICE THE COLLECTOR'S NATURAL ENEMIES ARE SWITCHBOARD OPERATORS AND SECRETARIES SO MR. CAIRO ADVISES CALLING THE DEBTOR BEFORE NINE AFTER FIVE AND DURING LUNCH
49mc040j AT THAT TIME THE PREY HIMSELF MAY ANSWER
49mc040k THE OPPOSITION IS ALREADY ROLLING
49mc040l MANY OF THE PRESSURE GROUPS THAT CAMPAIGNED UNSUCCESSFULLY AGAINST MR. REAGAN IN TWO PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS SEEM TO REGARD THIS BATTLE AS THEIR ARMAGEDDON
49mc040m TEDDY KENNEDY HIMSELF HAS TESTIFIED THAT JUDGE BORK'S APPEARANCE MEANS THE END IS NEAR
49mc040n IF RONALD REAGAN WANTS ROBERT BORK CONFIRMED HE WILL HAVE TO CREATE AN ALTERNATIVE CHOICE TO THE ONE THESE GROUPS ARE TRYING TO FORCE ON UNDECIDED SENATORS
49mc040o THAT MEANS MR. REAGAN HAS TO EXPLAIN CLEARLY WHY AMERICAN SOCIETY WILL BENEFIT IF JUDGES SUCH AS ROBERT BORK APPLY THE LAW IN A NEUTRAL MANNER
49mc040p HE WILL HAVE TO POINT OUT WHY MANY OF THE LONG HELD GRIEVANCES OF ELECTORATE RESULT WHEN UNELECTED JUDGES MANUFACTURE NEW LAWS
49mc040q <NOISE> MR. ANTONIU'S FALL AND SURPRISING REBOUND PROVE THERE IS LIFE AFTER INSIDER TRADING
49mc040r BUT HIS STORY ALSO SUGGESTS THAT SOME CHARACTER TRAITS THAT MAY GIVE RISE TO INSIDER TRADING CAN BE HARD TO CHANGE
49mc040s INSIDER TRADING IS A FORM OF FRAUD AND SOME SPORT ABOUT FRANCHISEES NOW CLAIM THEY HAVE BEEN DEFRAUDED BY MR. ANTONIU
49mc040t PET OWNERS OFTEN CALL A PET PSYCHIC BECAUSE A PET IS SICK AND THEY WANT A DETAILED ACCOUNT OF HOW IT'S FEELING
49mc040u AND SOME PET PSYCHICS CLAIM THEY CAN CHAT WITH PETS FROM A DISTANCE
49mc040v FOR EXAMPLE GAY TRAVERS A FORMER PUBLICIST CALLED PET PSYCHIC PENELOPE SMITH WHEN HER CAT SEBASTIAN WAS VERY ILL
49mc040w MS. SMITH TOLD HER TO HANG UP WHILE THE PSYCHIC TALKED TO SEBASTIAN
49mc040x THREE MINUTES LATER SHE CALLED BACK WITH SOME BAD NEWS
49mc040y LOST WAGES SOME ECONOMISTS ARE DISMAYED AT THE LABOR DEPARTMENT'S PLANS TO DROP THE HOURLY EARNINGS INDEX FROM ITS MONTHLY EMPLOYMENT REPORT NEXT YEAR
49mc040z IT'S A FASHIONABLE NUMBER SAYS MR. CHANDROSS OF LLOYD'S BANK NEW YORK
49mc0410 ECONOMISTS ARE CURRENTLY FOCUSING ON THE INDEX TO GET A READING ON WAGE INFLATION
49mc0411 THE LABOR DEPARTMENT WILL CONTINUE TO REPORT MONTHLY AGGREGATE DATA ON AVERAGE HOURLY EARNINGS
49mc0412 BUT THE INDEX IS BEING REPLACED BY THE EMPLOYMENT COST SERIES
49mc0413 ECONOMISTS SAY THE NEW INDEX HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF BEING A MORE RELIABLE READING AND THE DISADVANTAGE OF COMING OUT ONLY ONCE A QUARTER RATHER THAN EVERY MONTH
49mc0414 NEWSPAPER COSTS ARE UP SHARPLY THIS YEAR LARGELY BECAUSE OF HIGHER NEWSPRINT PRICES THE INDUSTRY'S BIGGEST COST BEHIND LABOR EXPENSES
49mc0415 SINCE OCTOBER NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX PRICES HAVE RISEN THREE TIMES BY A TOTAL OF ABOUT TWENTY ONE PERCENT
49mc0416 NEWSPAPERS HAVE RESPONDED BY USING LIGHTER WEIGHT PAPER TRIMMING PAGE SIZE AND CUTTING THE SPACE FOR NEWS
49mc0417 MEANWHILE CIVIL R. I. C. O. CONTINUES TO ATTRACT PLAINTIFFS WHO WANT TO TURN GENERAL BUSINESS DISPUTES THAT BELONG IN STATE COURTS INTO FEDERAL OFFENSES
49mc0418 FOR EXAMPLE A SMALL CONSORTIUM OF CONTRACTORS WHO CONSULTED ME HAD SUBMITTED THE LOW BID FOR A LARGE MARINA TO BE CONSTRUCTED ON LAKE MICHIGAN
49mc0419 THE SECOND LOWEST BIDDER RECENTLY FILED A CIVIL R. I. C. O. ACTION CLAIMING THAT MISREPRESENTATIONS WERE MADE BY THE SUCCESSFUL BIDDERS USING THE TELEPHONE THEREBY COMMITTING FEDERAL WIRE FRAUD
49mc041a NO MATTER WHAT THE DETERMINATION OF THE SUIT THE LOW BIDDERS HAVE ALREADY FELT THE STING OF SUCH POISONOUS WORDS AS RACKETEER
49mc041b FEDERAL FUNDS NINE PERCENT HIGH EIGHT AND THREE QUARTERS PERCENT LOW EIGHT AND SEVEN EIGHTHS PERCENT NEAR CLOSING BID EIGHT AND FIFTEEN SIXTEENTHS PERCENT OFFERED
49mc041c RESERVES TRADED AMONG COMMERCIAL BANKS FOR OVERNIGHT USE IN AMOUNTS OF ONE MILLION DOLLARS OR MORE
49mc041d SOURCE FULTON PREBON U. S. A. INCORPORATED
49nc0201 ONE PROBLEM WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE UNPOPULAR NEW W. FOUR FORM IS THAT THE I. R. S. FAILED TO TEST IT ADEQUATELY
49nc0202 IN FACT THE FORM WASN'T SHOWN TO THE PUBLIC AT ALL
49nc0203 IT WAS PRESENTED ONLY TO I. R. S. EMPLOYEES IN TWO OF THE AGENCY'S SERVICE CENTERS
49nc0204 OFFICIALS SUGGEST THAT THESE CLERICAL NON TECHNICAL WORKERS REALLY AREN'T MUCH DIFFERENT FROM THE GENERAL PUBLIC
49nc0205 STILL MR. GIBBS CONCEDES THAT THE AGENCY PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE SOUGHT A WIDER VIEW
49nc0206 MR. JOYNES WILL OVERSEE THE COMPANY'S OPERATING UNITS AS WELL AS THE COMPANY'S RESEARCH ACTIVITIES AND STAFF SUPPORT SERVICES THE COMPANY SAID
49nc0207 THE SPOKESMAN WOULDN'T COMMENT AS TO WHETHER MR. JOYNES MIGHT SUCCEED MR. DAY AS CHAIRMAN
49nc0208 MR. DAY MUST RETIRE AT AGE SIXTY FIVE
49nc0209 UNDER THE FEDERAL RAILWAY LABOR ACT THE REJECTION TRIGGERED A THIRTY DAY COOLING OFF PERIOD THAT STARTED YESTERDAY
49nc020a IF AMERICAN AND ITS UNION CAN'T REACH A SETTLEMENT BY THEN THE AIRLINE CAN IMPOSE ITS LATEST CONTRACT OFFER OR LOCK OUT ITS FLIGHT ATTENDANTS
49nc020b THE ASSOCIATION OF PROFESSIONAL FLIGHT ATTENDANTS ALSO WOULD BE FREE TO STRIKE BUT IT HAS SAID IT DOESN'T PLAN TO DO SO
49nc020c THE LASTEST DISCLOSURES ARE AN OUTGROWTH OF THAT PROBE
49nc020d ALREADY THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION HAS ACCUSED DELTA AIRLINES AND EASTERN AIRLINES OF ENGAGING IN UNREALISTIC SCHEDULING AT ATLANTA'S HARTSFIELD AIRPORT
49nc020e THE CARRIERS DENY THIS BUT THE GOVERNMENT HAS EXPANDED ITS PROBE
49nc020f IT HAS ASKED SEVERAL OTHER AIRLINES TO TURN OVER THEIR ON TIME RECORDS AT DALLAS FORT WORTH CHICAGO'S O'HARE AND BOSTON'S LOGAN AIRPORTS
49nc020g <NOISE> ALONG WITH HIS PARTNER PHIL DILEO MR. KELLNER HAS BEEN REGARDED AS ONE OF WALL STREET'S BIGGEST AND BRIGHTEST MONEYMAKERS
49nc020h KELLNER DILEO STARTED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE WITH ONLY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AND REPORTEDLY HAS HAD AVERAGE ANNUAL GAINS OF SIXTY PERCENT BEFORE PAYOUTS TO LIMITED PARTNERS
49nc020i LAST YEAR THE FIRM IS SAID TO HAVE EARNED MORE THAN SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS
49nc020j A CONVENTION WOULD OPEN THE DOOR TO A WHOLE NEW GROUP OF LEADERS
49nc020k AN ELECTION TO CHOOSE CONVENTION DELEGATES WOULD BE LIKE A SPECIAL ELECTION TO PICK A NEW CONGRESS

49nc020m NO CURRENT MEMBERS OF CONGRESS COULD PARTICIPATE

49nc020o B. P.'S PARTIALLY PAID AMERICAN DEPOSITARY SHARES CLOSED UNCHANGED AT SEVENTEEN AND ONE QUARTER WITH THIRTEEN POINT TWO MILLION TRADED
49nc020p IT WAS THE BIG BOARD'S MOST ACTIVE ISSUE
49nc020q IN A STATEMENT NYMEX EFFECTIVELY TOLD COMEX TO BACK OFF
49nc020r AND IT SUGGESTED THAT COMEX IS TO BLAME FOR THE DELAY SPECIFICALLY THE FACT THAT MR. BRODY NEXT MONTH WILL RELINQUISH HIS CHAIRMANSHIP TO AN EXCHANGE MEMBER

49nc020x IN LATE APRIL ENRON AN INTEGRATED NATURAL GAS CONCERN PUT OIL AND GAS ASSETS UP FOR SALE
49nc020y ANALYSTS VALUED THOSE PROPERTIES AT TWO BILLION DOLLARS AND ONE SAID ENRON HAS RECEIVED ABOUT TWENTY OFFERS
49nc020z ENRON WOULDN'T CONFIRM THE NUMBER OF OFFERS

49nc0211 SOME SINGLED OUT AS CONTRADICTORY A COOKING OIL AD TELLING PEOPLE HOW TO CUT DOWN ON CHOLESTEROL BUT FEATURING FRIED CHICKEN AND FRENCH FRIES
49nc0212 IT'S ALSO DISHONEST SOME SAID TO OMIT INFORMATION OR HIDE IT IN SMALL PRINT

49nc0214 I JUST CHECKED THIS MORNING HE SAID

49nc0216 IT'S BUSINESS AS USUAL
49nc0217 VOLUME IS NO DIFFERENT
49nc0218 THE MARKET HASN'T CHANGED CHARACTER
49nc0219 SO FAR FROM A MARKET VIEWPOINT <NOISE> IT DOESN'T LOOK TO BE MUCH OF AN EVENT
49nc021a EVER SINCE HE TOOK OFFICE THREE AND A HALF YEARS AGO MR. GORBACHEV HAS SOUGHT TO INCREASE FOREIGN TRADE'S MEAGER SHARE OF THE SOVIET ECONOMY
49nc021b RATHER THAN SIMPLY IMPORT MORE WESTERN GOODS HE WOULD LIKE TO OBTAIN THE MACHINERY AND KNOW HOW TO ENABLE THE SOVIETS TO MAKE THE GOODS THEMSELVES
49nc021c TO DO SO HE OPENED UP THE ECONOMY TO FOREIGN CAPITAL AND EQUIPMENT BY PERMITTING JOINT VENTURES
49nc021d HE RETURNED HOME IN TIME FOR HIS FIFTEENTH BIRTHDAY IN MARCH NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
49nc021e AS PART OF THE TREATMENT HE ATTENDED FIFTEEN WEEKS OF AFTER CARE FIVE DAYS A WEEK
49nc021f HE ALSO WAS REQUIRED TO GO TO NINETY MEETINGS OF ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS OR NARCOTICS ANONYMOUS IN NINETY DAYS

49nc030p ANOTHER OPTION WOULD BE GOING PRIVATE IN A LEVERAGED BUY OUT

49nc030z ASSUMING THE BIDDING DOES OPEN UP AGAIN IT MEANS THERE'S ROOM FOR TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND NOT CONSIDERATIONS BASED PURELY ON PRICE
49nc0310 THE SPOKESMAN SAID IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE FOR CRAY TO INSTALL AND OPERATE A COMPLETE SUPERCOMPUTER SYSTEM AT THE PRICES M. I. T. WANTED TO PAY
49nc0311 BUT WHILE NICKEL AND ESPECIALLY COPPER QUOTES HAVE SINCE REBOUNDED ALUMINUM PRICES HAVE CONTINUED TO TUMBLE
49nc0312 IT SEEMS TO BE IN PEOPLE'S INTEREST TO KEEP THE PRICE DOWN RIGHT NOW SAYS ONE LONDON EXCHANGE TRADER
49nc0313 THIS WILL ULTIMATELY GIVE THEM MORE BUYING OPPORTUNITIES DOWN THE LINE
49nc0314 PRICES ON THE UPSCALE ACURA DIVISION'S BASE MODEL CARS JUMPED EVEN HIGHER THAN THE HONDA DIVISION'S PRICES

49nc031b HOWEVER JOHN MENDELSON CHIEF MARKET ANALYST AT DEAN WITTER REYNOLDS BELIEVES SUCH A SLUMP COULD HAPPEN
49nc031c I THINK YOU WOULD GO BACK TO NORMAL TURNOVER LEVELS IN A BEAR MARKET
49nc031d YOU WOULD HAVE TO GO THROUGH NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR TO SEE A REAL DULL LOUSY MARKET
49nc031e TURNOVER LEVEL THAT YEAR SIXTEEN POINT FIVE PERCENT

49oc0208 THEY CAN'T DEAL WITH EARLIER RETAIL CUSTOMERS OR CORPORATIONS
49oc0209 THEY CAN UNDERWRITE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT BONDS BUT THE SHARE OF SUCH BUSINESS REMAINS VERY SMALL

49oc020p WHILE AIDS ALSO CAUSES SOME *NEUROPATHY* INCLUDING BOTH DISCOMFORT AND WEAKNESS IN THE HANDS AND FEET THE DRUG'S WORST SIDE EFFECT IS THE FOOT PAIN

49oc020z BUT IF IT SUCCEEDS COMPANIES THAT HAVEN'T DISMANTLED OR SCALED BACK THEIR RESEARCH EFFORTS COULD SUDDENLY BE AHEAD OF THE COMPETITION
49oc0210 BUT EXXON CORPORATION *AMOCO* CORPORATION AND *ATLANTIC* RICHFIELD COMPANY POSTED HIGHER PROFIT
49oc0211 NEW YORK BASED EXXON THE NATION'S BIGGEST OIL COMPANY HAD THE SMALLEST PERCENTAGE INCREASE
49oc0212 ITS NET INCOME CLIMBED FIVE POINT ONE PERCENT EVEN THOUGH GAINS FROM ASSET SALES CONTRIBUTED THIRTY FOUR CENTS A SHARE TO YEAR EARLIER PROFIT

49oc0219 THE SENATE PLAN WOULD PROVIDE THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE NATIONAL GUARD TO HELP THE CUSTOMS SERVICE WITH DRUG INSPECTIONS AT U. S. BORDERS
49oc021a BUT ADDITIONAL USE OF MILITARY RADAR PLANES EXPANDED NAVAL PATROLS AND MORE FREQUENT AIRCRAFT INTERCEPTIONS COULD DRAIN THE MILITARY'S ALREADY TIGHT OPERATING BUDGETS
49oc021b THE MEASURE DOESN'T PROVIDE ANY SPECIAL FUNDS FOR THESE OPERATIONS
49oc021c STEPHEN A. DUZAN CHAIRMAN PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER SAID IT'S OBVIOUSLY QUITE A CHANGE FROM A YEAR AGO
49oc021d IT'S OUR THIRD YEAR OF CASH FLOW AND WE'VE BEEN PROFITABLE FOR THREE OUT OF THE LAST FOUR QUARTERS
49oc021e SO WE THINK IN GENERAL THAT THIS REPRESENTS A REAL HEALTHY KIND OF PICTURE FOR A COMPANY WHOSE PRODUCTS AREN'T YET APPROVED
49oc021f THE COMPANY CURRENTLY HAS FOUR OF ITS EXPERIMENTAL PRODUCTS IN HUMAN CLINICAL TRIALS FOR DISEASES SUCH AS CANCER AND ACQUIRED IMMUNE DEFICIENCY SYNDROME
49oc0301 AS EXPECTED THE BUDGET WILL INCLUDE A NUMBER OF PROPOSALS THAT WERE UNSUCCESSFUL LAST YEAR INCLUDING THE SALE OF THE NAVAL PETROLEUM RESERVE AND THE BONNEVILLE POWER ADMINISTRATION
49oc0302 SOME ADMINISTRATION AND CONGRESSIONAL AIDES THINK CONGRESS WILL GO ALONG WITH SELLING THE PETROLEUM RESERVE THIS YEAR
49oc0303 BUT RESISTANCE TO THE BONNEVILLE IDEA WAS SO STRONG THAT LAWMAKERS PASSED A RESOLUTION PROHIBITING THE ADMINISTRATION FROM SPENDING ANY FEDERAL MONEY TO STUDY IT

49oc0308 ORGANIZED LABOR A MAJOR DEMOCRATIC CONSTITUENCY HAS FALLEN ON HARD TIMES AS REFLECTED IN A DECLINE IN THE UNIONIZED SHARE OF THE U. S. WORK FORCE

49oc030o FIRST INTERSTATE'S FOURTH QUARTER LOSS RESULTED FROM A PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED A HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION DOLLAR ADDITION TO ITS RESERVES AGAINST POSSIBLE FOREIGN DEBT LOSSES
49oc030p BUT EVEN WITHOUT THE RESERVES THE COMPANY SAID EARNINGS WOULD HAVE BEEN FLAT AT ABOUT EIGHTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS COMPARED WITH THE YEAR EARLIER QUARTER
49oc030q FIRST INTERSTATE HAD A SLIGHT DECLINE IN EARNINGS ASSETS AND NEGLIGIBLE GROWTH IN NET INTEREST INCOME

49oc030z MR. AGEE SAID THE LOSSES WERE A DISAPPOINTMENT AND A SURPRISE TO THE BOARD TOO
49oc0310 THAT SUGGESTS THAT MR. AGEE MIGHT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT IN TO SHAKE THINGS UP
49oc0311 IN A TELEPHONE INTERVIEW FRIDAY MR. AGEE DIDN'T RULE ANYTHING OUT

49oc040a A LIMITED STRIKE TARGETED AT KEY PLANTS A STRATEGY THAT U. A. W. USED FOR A WEEK AGAINST G. M. IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR WOULD BUFFER THE IMPACT
49oc040b A STRIKE AGAINST A SECOND COMPANY IN CANADA WHERE THE CANADIAN AUTO WORKERS UNION IS BARGAINING INDEPENDENTLY THIS YEAR FOR THE FIRST TIME COULD BROADEN THE DAMAGE

49pc030z IT IS ALL A PRESIDENT CAN DO TO KEEP UP WITH EVENTS TIME FOR REFLECTION IS A LUXURY BEYOND REACH
49pc0310 NOR IS THERE TIME FOR A PRESIDENT TO LEARN MUCH BEYOND THE KNOWLEDGE WITH WHICH HE COMES TO OFFICE
49pc0311 THAT'S WORTH REMEMBERING WHEN WE THINK NOT ABOUT NINETEEN NINETY NINE BUT ABOUT NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT
49pc0312 FRENCH PRESIDENT MITTERRAND NAMED A LONGTIME SOCIALIST RIVAL MICHEL ROCARD AS PRIME MINISTER
49pc0313 THE FORMER AGRICULTURE MINISTER KNOWN FOR HIS FREE MARKET VIEWS SUCCEEDS JACQUES CHIRAC WHO RESIGNED FOLLOWING HIS DEFEAT IN PRESIDENTIAL BALLOTING

49pc0315 IMPERIAL SAYS IT HAS HAD TERRIFIC UNSOLICITED INTEREST IN THE MATERIAL FROM ALL AREAS OF PLASTICS USES
49pc0316 BUT THE COST OF MANUFACTURING THE NATURAL PLASTIC IS PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE FIFTEEN DOLLARS A POUND COMPARED WITH ROUGHLY SIXTY FIVE CENTS A POUND FOR CONVENTIONAL PLASTIC
49pc0317 HOWEVER THE COMPANY SAYS IT HOPES TO REDUCE MANUFACTURING COSTS ENOUGH TO BEGIN MARKETING THE PLASTIC IN TWO TO FIVE YEARS

49pc031c THESE MIXED FEELINGS OF FRUSTRATION WITH AND GRATITUDE TOWARD THE AUTHORITIES ARE PART OF THE EVERYDAY LIFE OF A FOREIGNER DOING BUSINESS IN KOREA
49pc031d IN FACT SUCH CONTRADICTIONS ARE WHAT SEEM TO MAKE THE KOREAN WORLD GO ROUND
49pc031e A WESTERN BUSINESSMAN NEEDS TO BE READY FOR THEM
49pc031f HERE ARE A FEW HARD LEARNED FACTS OF KOREAN BUSINESS LIFE
49pc0401 THE TRASH
49pc0402 PROOFS OF PURCHASE AND SALES RECEIPTS THAT HAD BEEN TURNED IN FOR CONSUMER PRODUCT REBATES AND ALREADY PAID
49pc0403 THE WOMEN RESUBMITTED THOUSANDS OF THE REBATES AND CAMOUFLAGED THEIR TRAIL BY VARYING THEIR NAMES AND USING POSTAL BOXES ALL OVER THE COUNTRY
49pc0404 UNLIKE MORE ECLECTIC RAIDERS MR. TRUMP HAS SO FAR STUCK TO REAL ESTATE

49pc0407 HUMANA TRIED TO DEFEND ITSELF THROUGH DIVERSIFICATION AS DID THE OTHER LARGE CHAINS HOSPITAL CORPORATION OF AMERICA AMERICAN MEDICAL INTERNATIONAL INCORPORATED AND NATIONAL MEDICAL ENTERPRISES INCORPORATED
49pc0408 THE IDEA WAS THAT IF A HOSPITAL OWNER ALSO HAD AN INSURANCE PLAN IT COULD STEER PATIENTS TO ITS INSTITUTIONS THROUGH FINANCIAL INCENTIVES
49pc0409 THE PATIENT POOL MIGHT SHRINK BUT THE COMPANY COULD GRAB A BIGGER PART OF IT
49pc040a LAST MONTH AUTO SALES FELL ONE POINT FOUR PERCENT AFTER RISING FIVE POINT SEVEN PERCENT IN AUGUST

49pc040z THE DECLINE IN CRUDE PRICES EVENTUALLY WILL END HOWEVER
49pc0410 OR PRODUCT PRICES COULD AGAIN BECOME LINKED TO THOSE FOR CRUDE
49pc0411 AND GASOLINE DEMAND USUALLY DROPS AFTER LABOR DAY

49qc020b A. Z. T. IS MARKETED UNDER THE NAME RETROVIR BY BURROUGHS WELLCOME COMPANY AT AN ANNUAL RETAIL DOSAGE COST OF ABOUT TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS
49qc020c IT ALSO IS THE MOST EXPENSIVE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PROMPTING FEARS THAT SOME INSURERS WHO NORMALLY PROVIDE PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE WILL BALK AT ITS PRICE
49qc020d MR. BOTHA MUST ALSO RULE ON THE FATE OF THE GROUP AREAS ACT
49qc020e VIOLATIONS OF THE ACT ARE RAMPANT BUT THERE WERE ONLY FOUR PROSECUTIONS UNDER IT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX ONE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE AND NONE THE YEAR BEFORE
49qc020f A RECENT POLL BY THE AFRIKAANS NEWSPAPER RAPPORT FOUND THAT ONLY TWENTY SEVEN PERCENT OF SURVEYED WHITES WANT THE ACT RETAINED
49qc020g MORE THAN TWENTY FOUR PERCENT WANT IT SCRAPPED COMPLETELY WHILE ANOTHER THIRTY FOUR PERCENT WANT EACH LOCAL COMMUNITY OR PROPERTY OWNER TO DECIDE WHO CAN RENT OR BUY HOUSING

49qc020p THE FRENCH WERE SO IMPRESSED BY THE CELEBRATION THEY THANKED THE U. S. IN AN AD IN A NEW YORK NEWSPAPER
49qc020q IN THE END THERE IS LITTLE THE U. S. CAN DO TO CONTROL EVENTS IN SOUTH AFRICA
49qc020r THE ADMINISTRATION'S SIX YEAR CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT POLICY DESIGNED TO COAX PRETORIA TOWARD DISMANTLING APARTHEID DIDN'T SUCCEED
49qc020s AND SANCTIONS IN THE SHORT RUN WON'T DAMAGE SOUTH AFRICA'S SELF RELIANT ECONOMY

49qc0213 LAST WEEK COMMON CAUSE CALLED FOR AN INVESTIGATION OF MR. WRIGHT'S FINANCES
49qc0214 THE SPEAKER RETALIATED IN A PUBLIC STATEMENT AND HIS MINIONS IN THE LEADERSHIP SAID THE GROUP WAS DEAD ON CAPITOL HILL
49qc0215 THIS WAS ROUGH ON ALL DEBTORS DOMESTIC AS WELL AS INTERNATIONAL
49qc0216 BUT NO ONE PROPOSED SOLUTIONS FOR DOMESTIC DEBTORS AS GRAND AS THOSE OFFICIALLY OFFERED FOR THIRD WORLD DEBTORS
49qc0217 THE FIRST PART OF THE OFFICIAL PROPOSAL WAS TO REDUCE THE INTEREST BURDEN OF THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
49qc0218 SECOND PROMOTE WORLD ECONOMIC RECOVERY
49qc0219 THIRD NEW LOANS SHOULD BE MADE TO THE DEBTOR NATIONS BY THE BANKS THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND THE WORLD BANK AND EXPORT CREDIT AGENCIES
49qc021a IN ANY CASE A RETURN TO MARKET DISCIPLINE IS INEVITABLE

49qc021e IF THE PARTICIPANTS IN THIS CRAZE AWAKEN NOW THE CORRECTION MAY STILL BE WITHIN TOLERABLE LIMITS FOR THE COUNTRY
49qc021f IF NOT ALL OF AMERICA WILL PAY THE PENALTY BECAUSE THE DEBT IS HUGE AND WIDELY HELD AND THE BANKING STRUCTURE'S INTEGRITY WOULD BE AT STAKE

49qc0302 THERE IS SOME CAUSE FOR OPTIMISM
49qc0303 SHE SAID EXPORT GAINS HAVE SPURRED SOME OF THE IMPROVEMENT

49qc0305 ANDREW SHERWOOD A NEW YORK MANAGEMENT CONSULTANT SAYS THAT ONLY ABOUT FIVE PERCENT OF CHIEF EXECUTIVES DO THEIR OWN FIRING
49qc0306 THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE COMPULSIVE BUILDERS HE SAYS
49qc0307 THEY LIKE ACQUIRING COMPANIES MAKING PROFITS GO UP AND RECRUITING PEOPLE
49qc0308 FIRING ISN'T WHAT THEY'RE EMOTIONALLY GEARED FOR
49qc0309 THEY FIND IT REPUGNANT
49qc030a DEFENDERS OF THE FOOTNOTE ARGUE THAT IT MAKES SENSE AS TAX POLICY
49qc030b WHY THEY ASK SHOULD WEALTHY BEST SELLING AUTHORS GET SUBSTANTIAL TAX DEFERRALS WHILE MOM AND POP MANUFACTURERS FOR EXAMPLE CAN'T
49qc030c AS A RULE OF TAXES IT'S A GOOD RULE BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT PEOPLE TAKING DEDUCTIONS BEFORE THEY GET THE INCOME SAYS ONE CONGRESSIONAL AIDE
49qc030d IT'S THE TIME VALUE OF MONEY PRINCIPLE
49qc030e MR. AMMAN FORTY NINE YEARS OLD SAID HE BELIEVES WESTERN UNION'S DEBT AND EQUITY HOLDERS WILL SUPPORT THE RESTRUCTURING
49qc030f HE ADDED THAT THE RESTRUCTURING MUST BE COMPLETED IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS BECAUSE THE COMPANY IS RUNNING SHORT OF CASH
49qc030g WESTERN UNION HAS SAID THAT IF ITS PLANS ARE DEFEATED IT WILL FILE FOR REORGANIZATION UNDER CHAPTER ELEVEN OF THE FEDERAL BANKRUPTCY LAWS
49qc030h THE CONFRONTATION IN FEDERAL COURT MAY BREAK NEW GROUND IN BANKRUPTCY LAW
49qc030i OTHER COURTS NOTABLY THE ONE IN CHARGE OF THE MANVILLE CORPORATION CHAPTER ELEVEN PROCEEDINGS HAVE SET UP TRUST FUNDS TO PAY LARGE CLASSES OF INJURY VICTIMS
49qc030j BUT MANVILLE'S TWO POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLAR TO THREE BILLION DOLLAR TRUST INCLUDES PROVISIONS THAT ALLOW IT TO EXPAND IF FUNDS PROVE INADEQUATE TO PAY ASBESTOS RELATED CLAIMS

49qc0402 BY VIRTUE OF THEIR SIZE ALONE THEY WILL BE DOMINANT IN THE STATE MR. GRANT ADDED
49qc0403 EXACTLY WHAT IMPACT THAT COMPETITION WILL HAVE IS DIFFICULT TO ASSESS NOW HE SAID

49qc0405 ALSO A FOUR MILLION DOLLAR SHORT TERM LOAN FROM XEROX CORPORATION WAS CONVERTED INTO A LONG TERM NOTE
49qc0406 THE NOTE IS CONVERTIBLE INTO TANDON COMMON STOCK
49qc0407 LIKE THEIR ECONOMIES THE CURRENCIES OF THE U. S. AND CANADA ARE CLOSELY RELATED
49qc0408 BUT AS INTEREST RATES RISE IN CANADA THE CANADIAN DOLLAR IS GAINING ON ITS U. S. COUNTERPART TRADERS AND ANALYSTS SAY

49rc0210 SWITZERLAND ALREADY HAS ATTRACTED ONE MILLION RESIDENT ALIENS A PORTION OF ITS POPULATION GREATER THAN IN ANY E. C. STATE EXCEPT LUXEMBOURG
49rc0211 MOST SWISS THINK THAT IS ENOUGH AND THE COUNTRY HAS IMPOSED FOREIGN WORKER QUOTAS SO STRICT THAT SKILLED LABOR IS IN SHORT SUPPLY
49rc0212 YET IF SWITZERLAND CLOSES ITS DOOR TO MORE E. C. NATIONALS SWISS WHO WORK IN THE E. C. MAY FIND THEMSELVES LESS WELCOME
49rc0213 HE IS STRIKING NOW AT A TIME WHEN FINANCING FOR BIG DEALS IS READILY AVAILABLE AND THE STOCK PRICE IS DOWN

49rc0304 THE NEW TAX LAW'S LIMITS ON RETIREMENT BENEFITS FOR EXECUTIVES SPUR GREATER INTEREST IN CERTAIN TRUSTS THAT HELP SAFEGUARD DEFERRED COMPENSATION UNTIL RETIREMENT TIME
49rc0305 SUCH TRUSTS AREN'T COMPLETELY INVIOLATE CREDITORS CAN CLAIM THE MONEY AFTER A BANKRUPTCY FOR INSTANCE

49rc0307 <NOISE> THE DIET IS A ONE HOUSE LEGISLATURE APPORTIONED BY DISTRICT RATHER THAN POPULATION LIKE THE SENATE AS OPPOSED TO THE HOUSE

49rc030a WITH HOUSING TAKING ANOTHER FORTY PERCENT AND THE FACT THE JAPANESE ARE GREAT SAVERS THEY ARE LEFT WITH ALMOST NO DISCRETIONARY INCOME

49rc0407 TO DO THE JOB WOULD TAKE A BLAST EQUIVALENT TO A NUCLEAR BOMB

49sc0218 ONE BIG PLAY LAST YEAR WAS LEISURE
49sc0219 ANOTHER WAS UNDERVALUED ASSETS EVEN THOUGH NO ONE CAN RECALL A JAPANESE COMPANY BEING BROKEN UP FOR ITS ASSETS

49sc0313 LAST DECEMBER THE U. N. DIDN'T ATTEMPT TO SOLICIT BIDS
49sc0314 IT SIMPLY EXTENDED ITS CONTRACT WITH NATIONAL CARTING
49sc0315 SOLICITING BIDS IN THIS PARTICULAR INDUSTRY IS NOT THE WAY TO GO A U. N. SPOKESMAN SAYS IMPLYING THAT IT IS FUTILE
49sc0316 BUT CRITICS CHARGED THAT THE COLLAR ACTUALLY ADDED TO VOLATILITY BY MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR INDEX ARBITRAGERS TO DO THEIR BUSINESS

49sc031d IT IS BELIEVED THAT EXXON WAS OUTBID FOR SEVERAL RESERVE PACKAGES LEAVING IT WITH A LOT OF CASH THAT COULD STILL BE EARMARKED FOR ACQUISITIONS
49sc031e AT THE HOUSTON PETROLEUM CLUB INDUSTRY OFFICIALS COULDN'T EAT LUNCH OF LATE WITHOUT DISCUSSING THE SPECULATION THAT EXXON WAS GOING TO WALK AWAY WITH ALL OF THE TENNECO PROPERTIES
49sc031f AN EXXON SPOKESWOMAN SAID IT WAS COMPANY POLICY NOT TO COMMENT ON ANYTHING TO DO WITH ACQUISITIONS
49sc0401 ALSO SELLING WELL WAS A FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR ISSUE OF REVENUE BONDS BY THE FLORIDA DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES
49sc0402 THE UNSOLD BALANCE WAS ABOUT TEN POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS
49sc0403 THE BONDS WERE PRICED AFTER AUCTION TO YIELD FROM FOUR POINT TWENTY PERCENT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT TO SEVEN POINT TWENTY PERCENT IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE
49sc0404 MOODY'S RATED THE BONDS SINGLE A. WHILE S. AND P. RATED THEM SINGLE A. MINUS
49sc0405 GOLDMAN SACHS AND COMPANY WAS THE LEAD UNDERWRITER
49sc0406 STILL HE WOULD HAVE PREFERRED THERE BE NO BIDS AT ALL
49sc0407 THE COMPANY'S POLICY FOR EIGHTY FIVE YEARS HAS BEEN TO BE INDEPENDENT AND GROW AND WE HAVE SUCCEEDED HE SAYS
49sc0408 WE ARE EVALUATING THE OFFERS FOR THE COMPANY AND FOR THE SHAREHOLDERS BUT WE PROFOUNDLY REGRET THE SITUATION
49sc0409 SO STRANGE IS THE SITUATION THAT ONE HOLLY DIRECTOR HAS PROPOSED CHANGING THE COMPANY'S NAME TO FANTASY SUGAR COMPANY
49sc040a HE SAYS THAT COULD ENTICE SHAMROCK BECAUSE OF ITS DISNEY CONNECTION TO BUY THE COMPANY
49sc040b JUST THINK OF HOW MUCH THEY COULD MAKE ON THE MOVIE RIGHTS HE ADDS
49sc040c DURING THE PAST SEVERAL DAYS CORPORATIONS AND OTHER BIG INVESTORS HAVE REFRAINED FROM LENDING TREASURY BONDS AND NOTES TO SECURITIES DEALERS FOR BRIEF PERIODS
49sc040d THAT IN TURN HAS FORCED MANY DEALERS TO REFRAIN FROM SELLING BORROWED SECURITIES OR AMASSING SO CALLED SHORT POSITIONS
49sc040e IT'S HARD TO SHORT ANYTHING IN THIS MARKET AT THE MOMENT SAID A TRADER AT A LARGE GOVERNMENT SECURITIES DEALER
49sc040f MR. ANTONIU DENIES ANY WRONGDOING
49sc040g I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO WORRY ABOUT THE FORMER INVESTMENT BANKER SAYS
49sc040h I HAVE ALWAYS FOLLOWED THE ADVICE OF MY LAWYER AND ACCOUNTANTS
49sc040i HE SAYS THAT HE HAS COOPERATED IN AN INQUIRY BY FLORIDA OFFICIALS BUT THAT HE ISN'T AWARE THE MATTER HAS BEEN REFERRED TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE
49sc040j IN ANY CASE HE SAYS SPORT ABOUT'S PROBLEMS WILL BE CURED BY THE PUBLIC OFFERING AND ARE COMMONPLACE IN ANY RAPIDLY GROWING FRANCHISE BUSINESS
49sc040k WHERE CAN WE FIND SOME CLUES TO THE ANSWER OR AT LEAST A POSSIBLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION
49sc040l I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WE LOOK AT THE ONE MARXIST LENINIST STATE THAT ALREADY HAS GONE QUITE FAR DOWN THE REVISIONIST ROAD
49sc040m I REFER TO THE CURIOUSLY NEGLECTED INSTANCE OF YUGOSLAVIA
49sc040n OUTSIDE OF THE CONGRESSIONAL LEADERSHIP PATIENCE IS WEARING THIN ON PORK BARRELING CONTINUING RESOLUTIONS
49sc040o THERE ARE EVEN CONGRESSMEN WHO SAY THEY WANT TO PASS SEPARATE BUDGET BILLS THIS YEAR
49sc040p WE'LL SEE
49sc040q WHAT SEEMS MORE LIKELY IS THAT EITHER A PRESIDENT OR THE COURTS OR BOTH SOMEDAY WILL HAVE TO RESCUE THE VETO BY FORCING CONGRESS TO GIVE UP ITS ARROGANT WAYS
49sc040r SO FAR WE'VE FOUND THAT FEDERAL EMPLOYEES HAVE DEALT WITH THIS ISSUE WITH A GREAT DEAL OF SENSITIVITY AND COMMON SENSE MRS. HORNER SAID
49sc040s BUT THERE IS A NEED FOR CLARITY
49sc040t <NOISE> THESE GUIDELINES WILL SERVE AS REASSURANCE TO OUR MANAGERS
49sc040u SENATOR BENTSEN'S CORPORATE TAX PROPOSAL WOULD REPLACE A PROVISION IN THE COMMITTEE BILL ALLOWING THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE TO WITHHOLD REFUNDS FROM TAXPAYERS WHO HAVE DEFAULTED ON GOVERNMENT LOANS
49sc040v <NOISE> THIS PROVISION WOULDN'T RAISE ANY MONEY IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR AND SENATOR BENTSEN WANTED SOMETHING THAT WOULD ALLOW A QUICKER END TO THE DIESEL TAX COLLECTION
49sc040w THE TEXAS DEMOCRAT PLANS TO OFFER HIS SUBSTITUTION WHEN THE TAX PACKAGE REACHES THE SENATE FLOOR
49sc040x <NOISE> MAKERS WORLD WIDE HAVE BEEN RACING TO DEVELOP COMPACT DISK RECORDERS
49sc040y MANY BIG JAPANESE STEREO MAKERS INCLUDING NAMES LIKE SANYO AND SONY HAVE BEEN WORKING FOR YEARS TO DEVELOP SOMETHING AKIN TO TANDY'S NEW TECHNOLOGY
49sc040z LIKE TANDY'S THOSE MACHINES ARE ABOUT TWO YEARS AWAY ANALYSTS SAY
49sc0410 COMPACT DISK RECORDERS THAT STORE COMPUTER DATA RATHER THAN SOUND ARE EXPECTED OUT THIS YEAR
49sc0411 UNION PACIFIC CORPORATION HAS ROLLED TWO CLUB CARS INTO TOWN TO ENTERTAIN DEMOCRATS
49sc0412 THE COMPANY IS HEADED BY DREW LEWIS FREQUENTLY A TROUBLESHOOTER FOR THE REPUBLICANS
49sc0413 <NOISE> THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS IS THROWING SEVERAL PARTIES AND PROUDLY BOASTS THAT EIGHTY NINE OF ITS MEMBERS ARE DELEGATES OR ALTERNATES TO THIS CONVENTION
49sc0414 DISCUSSION OF THIS SUBJECT BETTER DESCRIBED AS BROODING ABOUT IT IS FILLED WITH MISCONCEPTIONS
49sc0415 ONE OF THESE IS THE GREAT CONCERN WITH THE U. S. HAVING BECOME A NET DEBTOR
49sc0416 WHAT IS MEANT BY THAT IS THAT AMERICANS APPARENTLY OWN FEWER ASSETS ABROAD THAN FOREIGNERS OWN IN THE U. S.
49sc0417 MANY PEOPLE HAVE POINTED OUT THAT THESE CALCULATIONS ARE SPURIOUS BECAUSE THE ASSETS ARE NOT ALL VALUED ON THE SAME BASIS
49sc0418 IF ALL ASSETS WERE VALUED AT TODAY'S PRICES THE NET DEBT OF THE U. S. WOULD CERTAINLY BE MUCH SMALLER THAN IT NOW APPEARS AND MIGHT BE A NET ASSET
49sc0419 INVESTORS TAKING PART IN THE FINANCING WILL LEND VENEZUELA ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN EXCHANGE FOR MONTHLY PAYMENTS FROM THE NEW YORK TRUST FUND
49sc041a THOSE PAYMENTS WILL BE SET WHEN THE FINANCING IS COMPLETED WHICH IS EXPECTED IN MID DECEMBER
49sc041b THE INTEREST RATE WILL BE BASED ON THE FIVE YEAR U. S. TREASURY BOND RATE PLUS A STILL UNDECIDED INTEREST RATE MARGIN THE VENEZUELAN OFFICIAL SAID
49sc041c <NOISE> INVESTORS CONTINUE TO FLOCK TO THE MORE CONSERVATIVE STOCK PORTFOLIOS
49sc041d <NOISE> GROWTH AND INCOME FUNDS WHICH COMBINE HEFTY DIVIDENDS WITH THE GOAL OF CAPITAL APPRECIATION LED ALL OTHER STOCK FUND CATEGORIES IN SALES FOR JUNE
49sc041e AMONG BOND FUNDS LONG TERM MUNICIPAL FUNDS CAPTURED THE TOP SPOT
49tc0201 I'M VERY NERVOUS BECAUSE MY VIEW ON RATES IS SO CLOSE TO THE CONSENSUS EDWARD *HYMAN* OF CYRUS J. LAWRENCE INC. SAYS
49tc0202 REMEMBER THE CONSENSUS IS USUALLY WRONG
49tc0203 THE MARKETS SEEM DETERMINED TO MAKE AS MANY ECONOMISTS LOOK AS STUPID AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN
49tc0204 I WAS STARTLED STARTLED ISN'T THE WORD REACTED ALVIN NOVICK A BIOLOGY PROFESSOR AT YALE UNIVERSITY
49tc0205 HE WARNED THAT FORCED TESTING SUCH AS CONTEMPLATED BY THE CENTERS WOULD DRIVE HOMOSEXUALS UNDERGROUND AND AWAY FROM COOPERATION WITH PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAMS
49tc0206 RATIONAL PEOPLE WON'T COOPERATE IN RUINING THEIR OWN LIVES HE SAID
49tc0207 LOCAL NEWSPAPERS YESTERDAY SAID THE GOVERNMENT MAY QUALIFY THE DECISION TO SIGN THE RESTRUCTURING AGREEMENT
49tc0208 BUT OFFICIAL SOURCES SAID THE SIGNING IS LIKELY TO TAKE PLAC:E DURING THE LAST WEEK IN SEPTEMBER
49tc0209 THE SIGNING DEADLINE IS OCTOBER FIRST
49tc020a OTHER TOY MAKERS SUCH AS MATTEL INC. HAVE BEEN BRINGING OUT NEW PRODUCTS EARLIER IN THE YEAR TO INCREASE SALES AT TIMES OTHER THAN CHRISTMAS
49tc020b BUT TYCO'S DAY AFTER CHRISTMAS LAUNCH IS UNUSUAL
49tc020c THE TOY BUSINESS IS RIPE <NOISE> FOR SOME MARKETING INNOVATION AFTER TWO YEARS OF RELATIVELY FLAT SALES SAYS RICK ANGUILLA EDITOR OF TOY AND HOBBY WORLD MAGAZINE
49tc020d IF TYCO SUCCEEDS OTHERS WILL CERTAINLY FOLLOW
49tc020e NO ONE SEEMS QUITE SURE HOW THE PUBLISHER JUGGLES HIS ASSETS AMONG HIS VARIOUS COMPANIES WHICH INCLUDE THE PUBLICLY OWNED MAXWELL COMMUNICATION CORPORATION AND VARIOUS PRIVATE ONES
49tc020f CONTROL OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY AND OF PRIVATE INTERESTS LIKE MIRROR GROUP NEWSPAPERS LIMITED RESTS WITH A FOUNDATION IN LIECHTENSTEIN PERGAMON HOLDING FOUNDATION ABOUT WHICH LITTLE IS DISCLOSED
49tc020g HE SAYS ITS BENEFICIARIES ARE CHARITIES WHICH HE PROMISES TO IDENTIFY SOMEDAY SOON
49tc020h THE BANK OF ITALY ALSO REPORTEDLY SOLD MARKS TO BUY ITALIAN LIRE
49tc020i THE TRANSACTIONS MAY HAVE BEEN DIRECTED MAINLY AT DEFENDING THE SAGGING LIRA IN THE EUROPEAN MONETARY SYSTEM IN WHICH EIGHT EUROPEAN CURRENCIES FLOAT WITHIN SPECIFIED LIMITS
49tc020j BUT THEY ALSO HAD THE EFFECT OF HELPING THE DOLLAR BY INCREASING THE SUPPLY OF MARKS IN THE MARKET
49tc020k FOR ENVIRONMENTAL TREATMENT WHICH LIKE MR. KIRK RELISHES AN EXTREMELY LOW PROFILE THE OIL SPILL HAS BROUGHT A WAVE OF ATTENTION
49tc020l IN FACT WHEN WALL STREET LEARNED THAT THE PUBLICLY HELD COMPANY WAS HIRED TO HANDLE THE MULTIMILLION DOLLAR CLEANUP THE CONCERN'S STOCK SHOT UP ALMOST TEN PERCENT
49tc020m YESTERDAY IN THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE COMPOSITE TRADING ITS STOCK CLOSED AT TWELVE DOWN TWENTY FIVE CENTS
49tc020n STATE WORKERS ARE ANOTHER CONSTITUENCY
49tc020o ONE IN FOUR WORKING PANAMANIANS OWES HIS LIVELIHOOD TO THE GOVERNMENT AND THE GENERAL EXPECTS HELP FROM ALL OF THEM
49tc020p DOWN THE STREET FROM MR. SANCHEZ'S OFFICE CARLOS A GOVERNMENT MECHANIC SAYS HE GOES TO MANY PRO *NORIEGA* DEMONSTRATIONS
49tc020q THE IMPACT WILL BE ENORMOUS
49tc020r THE REPUBLICANS' STRONGEST CASE AGAINST THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE HIS NAIVETE ON NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUES WILL DISAPPEAR
49tc020s THE SUSPICION OF A SELECTION BASED ENTIRELY ON POLITICAL INSTEAD OF *SUBSTANTIVE* GROUNDS WILL BE UNDERCUT
49tc020t AND A MESSAGE THAT THE CURRENT VICE PRESIDENT IS LARGELY IRRELEVANT WILL BE STRONGLY DELIVERED
49tc020u MR. TUCKER'S HARD HITTING CAMPAIGN HAS IN TURN APPALLED TOP UNION LEADERS WHO SAY HE HAS TARNISHED THEIR REPUTATION AS ONE OF THE LABOR MOVEMENT'S CLEANEST ORGANIZATIONS
49tc020v THE STATEMENTS OF AN UNDERCUT DEMOCRATIC UNION MAY BE IN BED WITH MANAGEMENT HURT THIS UNION SAID MR. BIEBER
49tc020w I RESENT THOSE STATEMENTS
49tc020x MR. DELCHAMPS SAID THIRTY PERCENT OF THE COMPANY'S STOCK HOLDINGS IS HELD BY PEOPLE WHO HAVE AGREED NOT TO SELL THEIR HOLDINGS BEFORE OCTOBER THIRTY FIRST
49tc020y ANOTHER TWENTY FIVE PERCENT IS HELD UNDER THE COMPANY'S EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN
49tc020z MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN THE FORMER CATEGORY ARE EXPECTED TO EXTEND THE NO SELL AGREEMENT FOR ANOTHER YEAR HE SAID
49tc0210 O. T. C. BROKERS ALSO STRESS THAT THEIR STOCKS OFTEN OUTPERFORM LISTED ONES ON A LONG TERM BASIS
49tc0211 AND OVERALL THE NASDAQ COMPOSITE INDEX IS UP THIRTEEN PERCENT THIS YEAR TWICE AS MUCH AS THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE
49tc0212 ALSO THEY NOTE THE TINY STOCKS THAT GENERALLY TRADE UNDER THREE DOLLARS A SHARE HAVE ALWAYS TAKEN BIG PERCENTAGE MOVES UP OR DOWN WHEN THEY MOVE AT ALL
49tc0213 THESE MIXED FEELINGS OF FRUSTRATION WITH AND GRATITUDE TOWARDS THE AUTHORITIES ARE PART OF THE EVERYDAY LIFE OF A FOREIGNER DOING BUSINESS IN KOREA
49tc0214 <NOISE> IN FACT SUCH CONTRADICTIONS ARE WHAT SEEM TO MAKE THE KOREAN WORLD GO ROUND
49tc0215 A WESTERN BUSINESSMAN NEEDS TO BE READY FOR THEM
49tc0216 <NOISE> HERE ARE A FEW HARD LEARNED FACTS OF KOREAN BUSINESS LIFE
49tc0217 THERE ARE ALSO BROKER FINDERS THAT GET FEES MERELY FOR MATCHING BORROWERS AND LENDERS OF STOCK
49tc0218 BROKER FINDERS CAN ALSO INCLUDE THE BROKERAGE FIRMS THEMSELVES
49tc0219 THE GOVERNMENT IS INVESTIGATING WHETHER ALL THE PAYMENTS THAT FLY TO AND FROM SUCH BROKER FINDERS ARE LEGITIMATE
49tc021a WE ARE EXTREMELY SELECTIVE SAYS PAUL SUCKROW DIRECTOR OF FIXED INCOME AT OPPENHEIMER MANAGEMENT CORP.
49tc021b I DON'T THINK SOME ISSUES ARE GOING TO MAKE IT HE SAID
49tc021c EVEN CAUTIOUS MANAGERS SUCH AS MR. SUCKROW ARE SEEING THE IMPACT OF THE CAMPEAU DEBACLE
49tc021d HE SAID HIS FIRM OWNS A SMALL AMOUNT OF THE FEDERATED SENIOR DEBT
49tc021e ALTHOUGH THE BONDS ARE SECURED BY BANK CREDITS THEY HAVE ALSO FALLEN IN PRICE RECENTLY
49tc0301 THE COMPUTER ALSO CAN DISPLAY A PATTERN SHOWING HOW PEOPLE NORMALLY PLACE THE TONGUE TO PRODUCE SAY AN S. SOUND
49tc0302 A DEAF PERSON CAN THEN TRY TO MATCH THE PATTERN BY PLACING THE TONGUE AGAINST THE ELECTRONIC PALATE
49tc0303 WITH CAREFUL COACHING AND TRIAL AND ERROR CHILDREN LIKE MISS GLORY CAN LEARN HOW TO MAKE SOUNDS THAT REQUIRE PLACING THE TONGUE AGAINST THE ROOF OF THE MOUTH
49tc0304 THE TRASH
49tc0305 PROOFS OF PURCHASE AND SALES RECEIPTS THAT HAD BEEN TURNED IN FOR CONSUMER PRODUCTS REBATES AND ALREADY PAID
49tc0306 THE WOMEN RESUBMITTED THOUSANDS OF THE REBATES AND CAMOUFLAGED THEIR TRAIL BY VARYING THEIR NAMES AND USING POSTAL BOXES ALL OVER THE COUNTRY
49tc0307 ROADRUNNER ENTERPRISES INC. SOLD ONE MILLION TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND COMMON SHARES AT TEN DOLLARS AND TWENTY FIVE CENTS EACH ALEX
49tc0308 BROWN AND SONS INC. LEAD UNDERWRITER SAID
49tc0309 THE ALBUQUERQUE NEW MEXICO BASED TRUCKING CONCERN SOLD ONE MILLION SHARES AND HOLDERS SOLD THE REST
49tc030a PROCEEDS TO THE COMPANY WILL BE USED TO PAY DEBT
49tc030b IN NATIONAL OVER THE COUNTER TRADING YESTERDAY ITS COMMON CLOSED AT TEN DOLLARS AND THIRTY SEVEN AND A HALF CENTS A SHARE UP TWELVE AND A HALF CENTS
49tc030c WITHIN TWO HOURS DAYTON HUDSON COMMON HIT FIFTY NINE A SHARE ON THE BIG BOARD UP TO SIXTY THREE DOLLARS IN OTHER MARKETS
49tc030d PEOPLE TOOK POSITIONS IN THE STOCK SIMPLY ON THE RUMOR OF A TAKEOVER BY SOMEONE NO ONE HAD EVER HEARD OF
49tc030e SOME OF THE FULL TIME RISK TAKERS DON'T EVEN NEED PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS TO PLUNGE
49tc030f NOR DO THEY REQUIRE INSIDE INFORMATION A LA IVAN BOESKY WHO WAS VENAL BUT NOT INSANE
49tc030g THE PEOPLE WHO INVESTED IN DAYTON *HUDSON* HOWEVER WERE MAD
49tc030h SOMEBODY DANGLED A FANTASY IN FRONT OF THESE SUPPOSEDLY SAVVY GUYS AND THEY WENT FOR IT LIKE TROUT TO THE FLY
49tc030i SELLING THE CANADIAN BUSINESS WILL HELP T. L. C. GROUP COMPLETE ITS FINANCING ON THE REST OF BEATRICE INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS
49tc030j T. L. C. GROUP SAID YESTERDAY THAT IT HAS A FIRM COMMITMENT FROM DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT INC. ITS INVESTMENT BROKER TO FINANCE AN ACQUISITION
49tc030k A DREXEL SPOKESMAN SAYS HE EXPECTS THE FINANCING TO COME THROUGH A COMBINATION OF BANK LOANS AND HIGH YIELD BONDS
49tc030l DREXEL FINANCED THE KOHLBERG KRAVIS BUY OUT OF BEATRICE LAST YEAR
49tc030m MR. LAY SAID THE LOSSES OCCURED IN LATE SEPTEMBER AND EARLY THIS MONTH A TIME OF PARTICULAR VOLATILITY IN OIL MARKETS
49tc030n THERE WERE TWO SENIOR PEOPLE COLLUDING AND KEEPING A SEPARATE SET OF BOOKS APART FROM THE OFFICIAL BOOKS FOR A FEW WEEKS MR. LAY SAID
49tc030o THEIR GUESSES WERE WRONG ON BOTH SIDES OF THE MARKET
49tc030p IN A STATEMENT TIMEPLEX SAID ITS DIRECTORS VOTED TO POSTPONE THE ANNUAL MEETING WHICH WAS SCHEDULED FOR YESTERDAY
49tc030q A NEW DATE HASN'T BEEN SET
49tc030r A UNISYS SPOKESMAN SAID THE COMPANIES HOPE TO COMPLETE THE ACQUISITION WHICH REQUIRES TIMEPLEX HOLDERS' APPROVAL AND GOVERNMENT CLEARANCE IN ABOUT FOUR MONTHS
49tc030s AT THE MEETING SHAREHOLDERS APPROVED AN INCREASE IN AUTHORIZED COMMON SHARES TO TWENTY MILLION FROM FIFTEEN MILLION
49tc030t THE ADDITIONAL SHARES MAY BE USED FOR BENEFIT PLANS TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING OR TO MAKE ACQUISITIONS
49tc030u THE COMPANY HAS ABOUT TEN POINT EIGHT MILLION COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING
49tc030v THE U. S. OF COURSE HAS A VAST AND IN MANY PLACES EFFICIENT INFRASTRUCTURE
49tc030w THE COUNCIL STUDY PUT A VALUE OF ONE TRILLION DOLLARS ON THE PARTS IT MEASURED
49tc030x BUT GOVERNMENT OWNED FIXED CAPITAL SUFFERS ALONG WITH PRIVATELY OWNED PLANT AND EQUIPMENT WHEN ECONOMIC POLICIES DISCOURAGE LONG TERM INVESTMENT
49tc030y THE GREATEST SCOURGE OF INVESTMENT IS OF COURSE INFLATION WHICH EXPLAINS WHY THE NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE SUFFERED PARTICULARLY DURING THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES
49tc030z USER FEES SIMPLY COULD NOT KEEP UP WITH THE SOARING COSTS OF LOANS AND CONSTRUCTION
49tc0310 HIGHWAY CONSTRUCTION HAD THE ADDED PROBLEM OF REDUCED YIELDS FROM GASOLINE TAXES BROUGHT ABOUT BY ENERGY SHORTAGES AND SHORTAGE ENFORCED CONSERVATION
49tc0311 THE MEASURE WAS A BOLD MOVE FOR A PRESIDENT WHO HAS COME TO VIEW INERTIA AS THE BEST FORM OF SECURITY
49tc0312 THE SUSPENSION EFFECTIVELY WILL SLASH SALARIES AND CUT AN ESTIMATED EIGHT POINT THREE BILLION FROM FEDERAL SPENDING THIS YEAR
49tc0313 THE AIM IS TO HOLD THE BUDGET DEFICIT TO FOUR POINT NINE PERCENT OF ECONOMIC OUTPUT DOWN FROM A PROJECTED SEVEN PERCENT
49tc0314 THIS IT IS HOPED WILL HELP STOP HIGH INFLATION FROM SPIRALING INTO HYPERINFLATION
49tc0315 THE THINK TANK MEASURED EXPENSE RATIOS WHICH ARE A FUND'S OPERATING COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF ASSETS
49tc0316 FOR INVESTORS HIGH RATIOS ARE CLEARLY OF CONCERN
49tc0317 IT CUTS INTO *POTENTIAL* RETURN EVEN WHEN A FUND IS DOING WELL
49tc0318 AND IT LEAVES A FUND WITH LESS OF A CUSHION IN CASE PERFORMANCE SOURS
49tc0319 ALMOST UNNOTICED IN DISCUSSIONS OF THE PROCUREMENT SCANDAL IS THE FACT THAT THIS ELABORATE INDEED TORTUOUS SYSTEM SEEMS TO HAVE WORKED AT LEAST ON ITS OWN TERMS
49tc031a NOBODY WAS ABLE TO THROW A CONTRACT DIRECTLY
49tc031b INSTEAD WHAT SOME CONTRACTORS SEEM TO HAVE DONE IS TO BUY INSIDE INFORMATION THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO PREPARE A BETTER PROPOSAL
49tc031c NINE MONTH RESULTS ALSO INCLUDE A TWELVE MILLION NET LOSS FROM THE DISPOSITION OF TRUCKING OPERATIONS
49tc031d ABOUT EIGHT MILLION OF THE TRUCKING CHARGE WAS TAKEN IN THE THIRD QUARTER
49tc031e YEAR EARLIER RESULTS WERE RESTATED FOR ACCOUNTING CHANGES
49tc031f N. E. C. CORP. AS ONE EXAMPLE BEGAN DONATING MONEY TO M. I. T. IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES
49tc031g ONE DONATION OF ONE MILLION WENT TO CREATE A C. AND C. SOFTWARE PROFESSORSHIP
49tc031h C. AND C. IS THE N. E. C. CORPORATE SLOGAN IT STANDS FOR COMPUTERS AND COMMUNICATIONS
49tc0401 THE BIG PROBLEM IS THAT DOCTOR THANOS CAN NO LONGER USE SO CALLED PASSIVE LOSSES FROM THESE PROPERTIES TO OFFSET HIS SALARY OR EARNED INCOME
49tc0402 THE DISALLOWANCE OF PASSIVE LOSSES IS BEING PHASED IN OVER FIVE YEARS
49tc0403 REAL ESTATE DEPRECIATION SCHEDULES ALSO HAVE BEEN LENGTHENED REDUCING THEIR VALUE
49tc0404 WHILE THE U. S. FOCUSES ON THE IRAN CONTRA HEARINGS MORE SOVIET ARMS FLOW INTO NICARAGUA
49tc0405 MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED MILLION WORTH OF WEAPONS WERE DELIVERED TO THE SANDINISTAS IN THE FIRST HALF OF THIS YEAR ACCORDING TO U. S. INTELLIGENCE
49tc0406 THAT'S ABOUT NINE TIMES THE DIRECT U. S. MILITARY AID PROVIDED TO THE CONTRAS IN THAT PERIOD
49tc0407 THE SOVIET EQUIPMENT IS JUST POURING IN ONE RANKING PENTAGON OFFICIAL TOLD THE A. P.
49tc0408 THE NICARAGUANS ARE CONSOLIDATING THE MILITARY BUILDUP AND ADDING TO IT EVERYTHING IMAGINABLE
49tc0409 ART COLLECTORS AND DEALERS HAVE HEAVED A SIGH OF RELIEF LAST NIGHT
49tc040a AFTER HIGH PRICES AND FRANTIC BIDDING AT ART AUCTIONS LAST SPRING ABOUT ONE IN FOUR WORKS DIDN'T SELL AT A CONTEMPORARY ART AUCTION AT CHRISTIE'S
49tc040b BUT AT LEAST THE MARKET DIDN'T CRASH
49tc040c CITICORP'S LOSS FOR THE YEAR STEMMED FROM A THREE BILLION DOLLAR ADDITION IN THE SECOND QUARTER TO LOSS RESERVES FOR LOANS TO DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
49tc040d EXCLUDING ONE TIME GAINS AND LOSSES CITICORP'S NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN PROFIT WOULD HAVE BEEN ONE POINT ONE FIVE BILLION
49tc040e EXCLUDED ARE GAINS ON REAL ESTATE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER AND PENSION ASSETS IN THE THIRD QUARTER PLUS THE EFFECT OF THE RESERVE ADDITION
49tc040f SOME REPORTERS WERE MORE ORIGINAL
49tc040g A PAIR FROM A LOCAL NEWSPAPER ASKED EDSEL IF HE FAVORED CASINO GAMBLING IN DETROIT A CONCEPT *HEAVILY* PROMOTED BY MAYOR COLEMAN YOUNG
49tc040h THE STRANGEST INQUIRY LOBBED AT BILL WAS WHAT ROLE I SAW AT FORD FOR MY DAUGHTERS WHO ARE TWO YEARS OLD AND TWO MONTHS OLD
49tc040i I THOUGHT THAT WAS KIND OF PUTTING THE CART BEFORE THE HORSE I WANT TO GET THEM OUT OF KINDERGARTEN FIRST
49tc040j AND WHAT IF THE FOUNDRY CAN'T KEEP UP WITH CUMMINS'S DEMAND
49tc040k MR. PATTERSON SAYS THE ENGINE COMPANY HAS BACKUP SUPPLIERS
49tc040l BUT HE ADDS THAT BACKUP IS ALL OFFSHORE
49tc040m PEOPLE ARE SCARED SAYS RICHARD ROSS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF INVESTOR BEHAVIOR A *RESEARCH* ORGANIZATION IN CHICAGO
49tc040n WHEN THE MARKET GOES DOWN STOP ORDERS APPEAR LIKE CRAZY HE SAYS
49tc040o AND IN A VOLATILE UNCERTAIN MARKET LIKE THIS INVESTORS USE LIMIT ORDERS TO TRY TO MAKE SHORT TERM GAINS
49tc040p ATTENDANTS IN SEARCH OF OTHER P. S. TWO CLONES HERE HAVE TO SCOUR CAREFULLY
49tc040q ACER INTERNATIONAL CORP. OF TAIWAN SHOWS A MACHINE BILLED AS COMPATIBLE WITH THE BOTTOM OF THE LINE P. S. TWO MODEL THIRTY
49tc040r THIS AVOIDS ALL THE LEGAL ISSUES AN ACER OFFICIAL PROMISES
49tc040s BUT IT ALSO AVOIDS MOST OF THE NEW TECHNOLOGY IN THE P. S. TWO FAMILY
49tc040t MAURICE *LIPPENS* CHAIRMAN OF BELGIUM'S GROUPE A. G. WHO TEAMED UP WITH SUEZ FOR THE GENERALE DE *BELGIQUE* STRUGGLE CONCURS
49tc040u THEY'RE RATHER ALLERGIC TO ALL THAT HE SAYS
49tc040v THEY HAVE A STRONG SENSE OF ETHICS
49tc040w BUT THEY SHOWED THAT BEHIND THE STAID FACADE THEIR MINDS WERE CLICKING
49tc040x IT DOES NOT HOWEVER SEEM REASONABLE TO THE GERMANS WHO ARE INSTEAD MULLING A TAX INCREASE TO SHORE UP A LEAKY GOVERNMENT BUDGET
49tc040y AS FOR THE U. S. COMMENTS ON GERMAN INFLATION A TYPICAL GERMAN MIGHT RESPOND ZERO INFLATION
49tc040z WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT
49tc0410 BUT FRED MCINTYRE A RAILROAD WORKER IN OMAHA NEBRASKA VOWS THAT HE WILL NEVER INVEST IN THE MARKET AGAIN FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE
49tc0411 WITH GOOD REASON
49tc0412 AS BLACK MONDAY DAWNED HE HELD IN HIS BROKERAGE ACCOUNT A HANDSOME NEST EGG OF MORE THAN FOUR TIMES HIS THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR A YEAR PAY
49tc0413 THE NEXT DAY ALL OF IT WAS GONE AND HE OWED HIS BROKER MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND TO BOOT
49tc0414 DAVID MEISTER F. N. N.'S PRESIDENT ACKNOWLEDGED THE COMPANY HAS BEEN IN DISCUSSIONS WITH OTHER MEDIA CONCERNS BUT HE DECLINED TO IDENTIFY THEM
49tc0415 WE'VE SPOKEN TO VIRTUALLY EVERY COMPANY YOU CAN IMAGINE PLUS A HALF A DOZEN MORE YOU WOULDN'T THINK OF MR. MEISTER SAID
49tc0416 HE DENIED INDUSTRY SPECULATION THAT F. N. N. IS LOOKING TO SELL THE COMPANY
49tc0417 WE'RE NOT INTERESTED IN SELLING AND WE'RE NOT SOLICITING ANYTHING HE SAID
49tc0418 HOWEVER HE ADDED THAT'S NOT TO SAY WE WOULDN'T ENTERTAIN ANY REASONABLE OFFER FOR AT LEAST A PIECE OF F. N. N.
49tc0419 IN A RELATED MATTER A REVIEW COMMISSION ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE ON OCTOBER EIGHTEENTH THREW OUT THE OSHA CITATIONS AGAINST MAXWELL
49tc041a THE CITATIONS ISSUED IN APRIL NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN <NOISE> CHARGED RECORD KEEPING VIOLATIONS
49tc041b THE OFFICIAL DISALLOWED OSHA'S INSTANT BY INSTANT CITATION WHICH PROPOSED A TOTAL FINE OF SIX HUNDRED AND NINETY THOUSAND
49tc041c THE OFFICIAL SAID OSHA DIDN'T ISSUE THE CITATION WITHIN SIX MONTHS A- SPECIFIED BY LAW FROM THE TIME AN OFFICIAL INSPECTION BEGINS
49uc0201 TO CURB DOMESTIC CONSUMPTION AND SALVAGE THE TRADE SURPLUS BRAZIL'S ECONOMIC PLANNERS RECENTLY IMPOSED A TOUGH PACKAGE OF TAX AND PRICE INCREASES
49uc0202 THE RESULT BRAZILIANS LAST WEEK RIOTED IN THE STREETS OF BRASILIA IN THE WORST VIOLENCE IN THE COUNTRY'S CAPITAL IN ITS TWENTY SIX YEAR HISTORY
49uc0203 AND A GENERAL STRIKE HAS BEEN TENTATIVELY SET FOR DECEMBER TWELFTH
49uc0204 RATES ARE DETERMINED BY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PURCHASE PRICE AND FACE VALUE
49uc0205 THUS HIGHER BIDDING NARROWS THE INVESTOR'S RETURN WHILE LOWER BIDDING WIDENS IT
49uc0206 THE PERCENTAGE RATES ARE CALCULATED ON A THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY DAY YEAR WHILE THE COUPON EQUIVALENT YIELD IS BASED ON A THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE DAY YEAR
49uc0207 THE LASTEST DISCLOSURES ARE AN OUTGROWTH OF THAT PROBE
49uc0208 ALREADY THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION HAS ACCUSED DELTA AIRLINES AND EASTERN AIRLINES OF ENGAGING IN UNREALISTIC SCHEDULING AT ATLANTA'S HARTSFIELD AIRPORT
49uc0209 THE CARRIERS DENY THIS BUT THE GOVERNMENT HAS EXPANDED ITS PROBE
49uc020a IT HAS ASKED SEVERAL OTHER AIRLINES TO TURN OVER THEIR ON TIME RECORDS AT DALLAS FORT WORTH CHICAGO'S O'HARE AND BOSTON'S LOGAN AIRPORTS
49uc020b IT WAS A WONDERFUL DAY FOR THE BOND MARKETS SAID MICHAEL J. CONNERY A SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF FINANCIAL FUTURES AT CHICAGO BASED REFCO INCORPORATED
49uc020c ALL THE APPARENT SIGNS OF INFLATION WERE DEFLATED
49uc020d AND THAT'S LED TO A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF SHORT COVERING OR TRADERS AND INVESTORS BUYING BACK SECURITIES THAT THEY BORROWED AND SOLD
49uc020e STILL WHATEVER THE RISK OF GARBAGE BURNING THE ALTERNATIVE LANDFILL IS WORSE SAYS MR. MCMANUS THE PUBLISHER OF RESOURCE RECOVERY REPORT
49uc020f INDEED MANY OLDER LANDFILLS WEREN'T PROPERLY CONSTRUCTED TO CONTAIN THE TOXIC SUBSTANCES NOW LEACHING FROM DECAYING TRASH
49uc020g IN MANY STATES WATER AND AIR QUALITY IS THREATENED
49uc020h NEW YORK CITY'S FRESH KILLS LANDFILL ON STATEN ISLAND FOR ONE DUMPS FOUR MILLION GALLONS OF TOXIC LIQUID INTO NEARBY FRESHWATER STREAMS EVERY DAY
49uc020i EVEN THE TRADITIONAL GREEN STAMP MIGHT BECOME A THING OF THE PAST
49uc020j IN RESPONSE TO CONSUMERS' COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE TASK OF PASTING IN TRADING STAMPS SPERRY AND HUTCHINSON COMPANY IS TESTING ELECTRONIC GREEN STAMPS IN SUPERMARKETS IN CONNECTICUT
49uc020k INSTEAD OF RECEIVING PAPER STAMPS CONSUMERS HAND THE CASHIER A PLASTIC CARD
49uc020l THE CARD IS INSERTED INTO A TERMINAL THAT AUTOMATICALLY RECORDS THE NUMBER OF STAMPS ACCRUED
49uc020m RORER GROUP WHOSE STOCK EASED THREE EIGHTHS TO THIRTY FIVE AND THREE FOURTHS SAID IT SIGNED A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE A. H. ROBINS
49uc020n THE AGREEMENT IS A KEY PART OF ROBINS'S BANKRUPTCY REORGANIZATION PLAN
49uc020o ROBINS JUMPED ONE AND ONE HALF TO TWENTY ONE
49uc020p BUT WHILE NICKEL AND ESPECIALLY COPPER QUOTES HAVE SINCE REBOUNDED ALUMINUM PRICES HAVE CONTINUED TO TUMBLE
49uc020q IT SEEMS TO BE IN PEOPLE'S INTEREST TO KEEP THE PRICE DOWN RIGHT NOW SAYS ONE LONDON EXCHANGE TRADER
49uc020r THIS WILL ULTIMATELY GIVE THEM MORE BUYING OPPORTUNITIES DOWN THE LINE
49uc020s SOURCES SAID AN ANNOUNCEMENT WILL BE MADE THIS MORNING IN TORONTO FOLLOWED BY A NEWS CONFERENCE
49uc020t BURNS FRY'S ABOUT SEVENTY MEMBER BOARD YESTERDAY WAS PRESENTED WITH THE PROPOSAL BY ITS ELEVEN MEMBER EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE WHICH ALREADY HAS APPROVED THE TRANSACTION
49uc020u SECURITY PACIFIC'S BOARD APPROVED THE TRANSACTION AT A MEETING A FEW DAYS AGO THE SOURCES SAID
49uc020v THE EXPECTED FOURTH QUARTER RESULT WOULD GIVE THE COMPANY PROFIT OF TEN TO TWELVE CENTS A SHARE FOR ALL OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
49uc020w IT POSTED PROFIT OF TWENTY SEVEN CENTS A SHARE FOR NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX INCLUDING ABOUT FOURTEEN CENTS A SHARE FROM AN ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENT
49uc020x THE COMPANY DIDN'T MAKE ESTIMATES FOR NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN NET INCOME
49uc020y AT SCHWAB THE NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT CAPITAL BUDGET IS ABOUT TWENTY PERCENT LESS THAN THE AMOUNT BEING SPENT THIS YEAR ACCORDING TO LAWRENCE STUPSKI SCHWAB'S PRESIDENT
49uc020z BEFORE THE CRASH SCHWAB EXPECTED TO OPEN THIRTY NEW OFFICES IN THE NEXT TWO YEARS
49uc0210 BUT MR. STUPSKI SAID THAT NUMBER HAS BEEN CUT ABOUT FIFTY PERCENT BECAUSE OF THE OUTLOOK FOR LOWER VOLUMES
49uc0211 OFF THE HOOK THE RESIGNATION OF JUSTICE DEPARTMENT CRIMINAL DIVISION CHIEF WELD ERASES RHODE ISLAND REPRESENTATIVE SAINT GERMAIN'S RISK OF INDICTMENT FOR TAKING MEALS FROM LOBBYISTS
49uc0212 AGENCY LAWYERS WHO RAN A GRAND JURY INVESTIGATION URGED NO ACTION CITING HOUSE RULES ALLOWING NEARLY UNLIMITED ENTERTAINMENT
49uc0213 WELD WAS RELUCTANT TO DROP THE CASE
49uc0214 ROBERT RAVITZ A GREY SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT SAYS THE AGENCY DID THE BEST IT COULD BASED ON DRAWINGS OF THE COIN
49uc0215 RESPONDING TO MISS JONES'S COMMENTS HE SAYS I DON'T KNOW WHAT HER PROBLEM IS WITH THE ARTWORK
49uc0216 IT WAS AN INCREDIBLE TIME CRUNCH
49uc0217 IF WE HAD LONGER TIME I'M SURE WE COULD HAVE MASSAGED THE ARTWORK TO DEATH
49uc0218 SO FAR THE ADMINISTRATION HAS IGNORED THESE APPEALS AND SO HAVE MR. REED AND OTHER BANKERS
49uc0219 IT SEEMS THAT PRINCIPLES ENUNCIATED AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS DECADE BY MESSRS.
49uc021a WRISTON AND THEOBALD STILL PREVAIL IF NOT IN LENDING THE BANK'S MONEY AT LEAST IN SUGGESTING THAT OTHER INVESTORS PUT UP THE CASH
49uc021b BUT EXPERIENCE SHOWS THAT ONCE AN UPSCALE PRODUCT PUTS ITS NAME ON LOWER PRICED GOODS IT CAN NEVER GO BACK UP
49uc021c REVLON GROUP INCORPORATED FOR EXAMPLE IS MAKING A LONG SHOT ATTEMPT TO REKINDLE THE HALSTON FLAME
49uc021d REVLON OWNER OF HALSTON ENTERPRISES INCORPORATED HAS VISIONS OF SEEING HALSTON LABEL CLOTHES BACK IN BETTER DRESS DEPARTMENTS
49uc021e BUT MARKETERS BELIEVE THE COMPANY HAS A CREDIBILITY PROBLEM AFTER ITS SIX YEAR ASSOCIATION WITH RETAILER J. C. PENNEY COMPANY WHICH ENDED LAST YEAR
49uc0301 BUT WHEN L. B. O. COMPANIES SELL STOCK THE BIG WINNERS USUALLY ARE A TIGHT CIRCLE OF EXECUTIVES AND INVESTMENT BANKERS WHO EARLIER BOUGHT CONTROL
49uc0302 PROFITS OFTEN EXCEED TEN TIMES THESE INVESTORS' ORIGINAL STAKE
49uc0303 THESE GIANT CONCENTRATED PAYOFFS FROM L. B. O.S ARE STARTING TO ANGER MAINSTREAM INVESTORS AND WORRY ACADEMICS
49uc0304 IT'S INCONCEIVABLE THAT THE DIRECTORATE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT MR. RODRIGUEZ COMMENTS ONE INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS WORKER WHO HAS STUDIED THE LOCAL REFUGEE SITUATION
49uc0305 THE PEOPLE OF EL BARILLO ARE UNDER THE BOOT
49uc0306 THEY'VE BEEN SMART ENOUGH TO SURVIVE
49uc0307 THEY'VE ADAPTED
49uc0308 THE NEW TAX LAW'S LIMITS ON RETIREMENT BENEFITS FOR EXECUTIVES SPUR GREATER INTEREST IN CERTAIN TRUSTS THAT HELP SAFEGUARD DEFERRED COMPENSATION UNTIL RETIREMENT TIME
49uc0309 SUCH TRUSTS AREN'T COMPLETELY INVIOLATE CREDITORS CAN CLAIM THE MONEY AFTER A BANKRUPTCY FOR INSTANCE
49uc030a BUT THEY ARE CONSIDERED BETTER THAN A MERE PROMISE TO THE EXECUTIVE
49uc030b THE DRUG AZIDOTHYMIDINE OR A. Z. T. IS THE FIRST PRESCRIPTION DRUG FOR ACQUIRED IMMUNE DEFICIENCY SYNDROME TO GET FEDERAL FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION APPROVAL
49uc030c A. Z. T. IS MARKETED UNDER THE NAME RETROVIR BY BURROUGHS WELLCOME COMPANY AT AN ANNUAL RETAIL DOSAGE COST OF ABOUT TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS
49uc030d IT ALSO IS THE MOST EXPENSIVE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PROMPTING FEARS THAT SOME INSURERS WHO NORMALLY PROVIDE PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE WILL BALK AT ITS PRICE
49uc030e NOW THE ISSUE IS IN THE HOUSE'S LAP
49uc030f THE TEMPORARY BAN ON NEW BANKING POWERS IS A PROVISION IN THE SENATE VERSION OF A BILL TO RECAPITALIZE THE INSOLVENT FEDERAL SAVINGS AND LOAN INSURANCE CORPORATION
49uc030g THE HOUSE F. S. L. I. C. MEASURE DOESN'T HAVE ANY OTHER PROVISIONS
49uc030h IN ADDITION BY CONSENTING TO RORER'S BID ROBINS MAY HAVE PUT ITSELF UP FOR SALE
49uc030i THE WHOLE THING COULD STILL DETERIORATE INTO AN AUCTION SAID A LAWYER WHO WAS INVOLVED IN THE MANVILLE CORPORATION BANKRUPTCY LAW CASE
49uc030j OTHER BIDDERS COULD COME IN
49uc030k CALIFORNIANS WERE ASKED HOW THE STATE SHOULD GET RID OF ITS HEFTY BUDGET SURPLUS NOW ESTIMATED AT ONE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS
49uc030l BY A TWO TO ONE MARGIN REGISTERED DEMOCRATS SURVEYED BY THE FIELD INSTITUTE FAVORED GIVING THE MONEY TO PUBLIC SCHOOLS
49uc030m BUT THE STATE CONSTITUTION MAY REQUIRE THE MONEY TO BE RETURNED DIRECTLY TO TAXPAYERS
49uc030n THAT APPEARS MORE IN LINE WITH REPUBLICAN THINKING
49uc030o REPUBLICANS ASKED HOW TO DISBURSE THE SURPLUS SPLIT FIFTY FIFTY BETWEEN SCHOOLS AND PERSONAL TAX REBATES
49uc030p HARRY TRUMAN WHISTLE STOPPED THE COUNTRY IN NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT CAMPAIGNING AGAINST A PAROCHIAL DO NOTHING CONGRESS THAT WOULD NOT ENACT HIS LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM
49uc030q HE STRUCK A CHORD IN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NOT ONLY WINNING A STUNNING UPSET BUT ALSO DEFEATING SCORES OF REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMEN IN THE PROCESS
49uc030r TRUMAN RECOGNIZED THAT A PRESIDENTIAL CONTEST IS NOT JUST A RACE AMONG CANDIDATES BUT ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY TO DEBATE GREAT ISSUES SUCH AS THE PROPER SEPARATION OF POWERS
49uc030s THE CONTEST THEN ISN'T IDEOLOGICAL
49uc030t IT'S CHARACTER PERSONALITY EXPERIENCE
49uc030u IT'S CULTURAL AS MUCH AS ANYTHING ELSE
49uc030v PRESIDENT REAGAN WHO WAS IN DURHAM NORTH CAROLINA WAS CAUTIOUS ABOUT THE SOVIET OFFER
49uc030w I'M WAITING TO SEE WHAT THE CONDITIONS ARE HE SAID
49uc030x A SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL HOWEVER CALLED THE GORBACHEV STATEMENT A WATERSHED EVENT BECAUSE IT WILL INCREASE EXPECTATIONS AMONG SOVIET PEOPLE FOR WITHDRAWAL
49uc030y COMPLETION OF THE TRANSACTION WHICH ALSO REQUIRES APPROVAL BY REGULATORY AGENCIES AND HOLDERS OF OTHER SECURITIES MUST BE COMPLETED NO LATER THAN NOVEMBER THIRTIETH UNDER THE AGREEMENT
49uc030z IF IT DOESN'T CLOSE AS EXPECTED BY SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH THE CASH PRICE PAID BY NOVA FOR EACH POLYSAR COMMON SHARE WOULD RISE TEN CANADIAN CENTS
49uc0310 THE CASH PRICE WOULD RISE FIFTEEN MORE CENTS TO FOURTEEN POINT SEVEN FIVE CANADIAN DOLLARS A SHARE IF THE TRANSACTION CLOSES IN NOVEMBER THE SIDES SAID
49uc0311 TRANSAMERICA SAID ITS CONSUMER LENDING BUSINESS ACHIEVED RECORD RESULTS IN THE QUARTER WITH CONSUMER LOANS SECURED BY REAL ESTATE GROWING TO TWO POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS
49uc0312 ITS LEASING BUSINESS ALSO POSTED RECORD RESULTS
49uc0313 DEMAND FOR STANDARD CONTAINERS WAS HIGH BECAUSE OF STRONG WORLD TRADE TRANSAMERICA SAID
49uc0314 HOWEVER THE SAN FRANCISCO BASED COMPANY SAID ITS REAL ESTATE OPERATIONS REPORTED LOWER EARNINGS
49uc0315 THAT LEAVES THE OPTION OF A MILITARY STRIKE AT TERRORISTS OR THEIR BASES WHICH ARE MAINLY IN LEBANON'S BEKAA VALLEY AN AREA UNDER SYRIAN CONTROL
49uc0316 U. S. INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES HAVE IDENTIFIED AS POTENTIAL TARGETS THERE BUILDINGS KNOWN TO HAVE BEEN USED BY HEZBOLLAH FORCES AND THEIR MENTORS THE IRANIAN REVOLUTIONARY GUARDS
49uc0317 BUT THEY AREN'T CERTAIN WHICH FACTIONS USE WHICH BUILDINGS OR WHEN THEY ARE PRESENT
49uc0318 QUITE POSSIBLY A RECENT PROFIT SHARING BONUS HELPED
49uc0319 WE DON'T HAVE AN ELEGANT FORMULA SAYS MR. BARRON
49uc031a WE SAID WE THINK EVERYONE'S ENTITLED TO A SHARE SO HERE'S A CHECK
49uc031b NEXT YEAR IF WE DO WELL THERE MAY BE A BIGGER CHECK
49uc031c IS THIS ANY WAY TO RUN A RAILROAD
49uc031d COULD BE
49uc031e CONSUMERS MAY ALSO BE WORRIED ABOUT WHETHER AUTO MAKERS WILL CONTINUE THE GENEROUS INCENTIVES THEY'VE USED ALMOST CONTINUOUSLY OVER THE PAST YEAR TO BUOY SALES
49uc031f WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IS THE GOOD OLD BUY IN ADVANCE SYNDROME SAID JOHN QUALLS OF MICRO ECONOMICS LIMITED IN SAINT LOUIS
49uc031g MR. QUALLS EXPECTS SALES TO SAG BADLY IN THE FOURTH QUARTER CAUSING SUPPLIES OF UNSOLD VEHICLES TO RISE UNLESS AUTO MAKERS SHOW CONTINUED RESTRAINT IN PRODUCTION
49uc0401 THE IRANIAN CRISIS AND THE ADMINISTRATION'S UNCERTAIN GRIP ON IT HAS REAWAKENED THIS CYNICISM
49uc0402 THE POLLS SHOW MUCH OF THE PUBLIC DOES NOT BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT WHEN HE DENIES KNOWING THAT PROFITS FROM IRANIAN ARMS SALES HAD BEEN USED TO AID THE CONTRAS
49uc0403 ON THIS THE MATTER IS LIKELY TO TURN
49uc0404 NOT ON WHETHER THE SHIPMENTS WERE A GOOD IDEA OR ON WHETHER LAWYERS CAN FIND SOME LAW THAT HAS BEEN BROKEN
49uc0405 BUT ON WHETHER PRESIDENT REAGAN TOLD THE TRUTH WHEN HE DENIED KNOWING
49uc0406 INTERCO SAID THAT BECAUSE OF THE DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT ITS INTERCO SUBSIDIARY INCORPORATED UNIT TERMINATED ITS TENDER OFFER FOR ALL LANE COMMON SHARES AT FIFTY FIVE DOLLARS A SHARE
49uc0407 THE OFFER WAS SET TO EXPIRE MONDAY
49uc0408 ANY SHARES TENDERED TO INTERCO UNDER THE OFFER WILL BE RETURNED TO LANE SHAREHOLDERS INTERCO SAID
49uc0409 NEVERTHELESS FIRST OPTIONS STILL LETS CUSTOMERS SUCH AS JAMES F. HART TRADE IN NAKED OUT OF THE MONEY PUTS AND CALLS
49uc040a MR. HART SAYS FIRST OPTIONS HASN'T SOUGHT TO REIN HIM IN
49uc040b OTHER BROKERAGE FIRMS HOWEVER HAVE CURBED OR HALTED UNHEDGED OPTIONS TRADING SINCE THE CRASH
49uc040c PET OWNERS OFTEN CALL A PET PSYCHIC BECAUSE A PET IS SICK AND THEY WANT A DETAILED ACCOUNT OF HOW IT'S FEELING
49uc040d AND SOME PET PSYCHICS CLAIM THEY CAN CHAT WITH PETS FROM A DISTANCE
49uc040e FOR EXAMPLE GAY TRAVERS A FORMER PUBLICIST CALLED PET PSYCHIC PENELOPE SMITH WHEN HER CAT SEBASTIAN WAS VERY ILL
49uc040f MS. SMITH TOLD HER TO HANG UP WHILE THE PSYCHIC TALKED TO SEBASTIAN
49uc040g THREE MINUTES LATER SHE CALLED BACK WITH SOME BAD NEWS
49uc040h DOES THAT MEAN A CABINET POST
49uc040i YEAH SAID MR. IACOCCA
49uc040j MAYBE
49uc040k MORE LIKELY THOUGH MR. IACOCCA WOULD PREFER TO BE PART OF AN INFORMAL GROUP OF PRESIDENTIAL ADVISERS
49uc040l EARLIER THIS YEAR THE SIXTY THREE YEAR OLD EXECUTIVE SIGNED A NEW FOUR YEAR CONTRACT WITH CHRYSLER
49uc040m AND IN TUESDAY'S INTERVIEW MR. IACOCCA MAINTAINED THAT HE WANTS TO LEAD THE COMPANY INTO THE NINETEEN NINETIES
49uc040n NEITHER THE VOLUNTEER DOCTORS NOR THE SCIENTISTS CONDUCTING THE EXPERIMENT KNEW WHICH VOLUNTEERS WERE TAKING ACTIVE ASPIRIN AND WHICH WERE TAKING PLACEBOS
49uc040o HOWEVER A SEPARATE COMMITTEE WAS SET UP TO MONITOR THE RESULTS OF THE EXPERIMENT AS IT PROCEEDED
49uc040p IT WAS THIS COMMITTEE THAT IN DECEMBER DECIDED THAT THE BENEFITS OF THE ASPIRIN IN REDUCING HEART ATTACKS WERE SO CLEAR THERE WASN'T ANY NEED TO CONTINUE THE EXPERIMENT
49uc040q IT'S A WELCOME DEVELOPMENT IN THE FACE OF VERY SIGNIFICANT INVENTORY OVERHANG SAYS MORGAN STANLEY'S MR. ROACH
49uc040r A SLOWING OF GROWTH IN PRODUCTION GIVES COMPANIES THE ABILITY TO WORK OFF SOME INVENTORY
49uc040s AND ECONOMISTS NOTE THAT THE STEADY OPERATING RATE INDICATES CONTINUED STRENGTH IN THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR
49uc040t THE FOLLOWING DAY MR. LI MARCHED TO CITY HALL HIS AGING PASTRIES IN HAND AND DUMPED THEM ON THE DESK OF THE SURPRISED MAYOR
49uc040u THE MARKETS ARE FULL OF POOR QUALITY PASTRIES MR. LI PROCLAIMED
49uc040v WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT
49uc040w IN MY ORIGINAL SQUAD I'M THE ONLY ONE LEFT UNHARMED
49uc040x IN MY PLATOON THERE'S ONLY THIRTEEN OF US
49uc040y IT SEEMS EVERYDAY ANOTHER YOUNG GUY EIGHTEEN TO NINETEEN YEARS OLD LIKE MYSELF IS KILLED IN ACTION
49uc040z AS FOR PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS WALL STREET'S EUPHEMISM FOR TRIGGER HAPPY TRADING IT'S A BIT HARDER TO GAUGE THE RISKS
49uc0410 THE FIRM IS A BIG GOVERNMENT BOND TRADER AND HAS GROWN A LOT IN FOREIGN CURRENCY TRADING
49uc0411 AND AMONG MORGAN STANLEY'S BIGGEST PERCENTAGE GAINS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN WAS EQUITY PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS WHICH NEARLY TRIPLED TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS IN REVENUE
49uc0412 IT'S PRETTY REASONABLE FOR PEOPLE TO TAKE A DIVE ON THIS ONE HE SAYS
49uc0413 I'M A LITTLE SCARED
49uc0414 I DON'T BLAME PEOPLE FOR NOT BEING HEROES
49uc0415 JONES INTERCABLE ALSO BOUGHT SEVERAL SYSTEMS SERVING TWELVE THOUSAND SUBSCRIBERS IN THE SOUTHWESTERN MICHIGAN AREA
49uc0416 IT MADE THE ACQUISITION ON BEHALF OF JONES CABLE INCOME FUND ONE -DASH B. AND C. VENTURE A JOINT VENTURE OF TWO INTERCABLE MANAGED LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS
49uc0417 THE PURCHASE WAS FROM OMEGA AFFILIATES
49uc0418 DANIEL J. GILMARTIN WAS NAMED PRESIDENT AND CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER OF FRANK'S NURSERY AND CRAFTS DETROIT A UNIT OF THIS SPECIALTY RETAILER
49uc0419 THE POSTS HAD BEEN VACANT SINCE EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
49uc041a MR. GILMARTIN HAD BEEN DIRECTOR CORPORATE PLANNING FOR THE PARENT COMPANY
49uc041b ECONOMISTS SEEK NEW METAPHORS TO REPLACE SOFT LANDING
49uc041c STEPHEN ROACH OF MORGAN STANLEY SAYS THE WHEELS HAVEN'T HIT THE RUNWAY
49uc041d KEMPER FINANCIAL SERVICES' DAVID HALE REFERS TO A SOFT TAKEOFF
49uc041e THE LATEST DATA FUEL FED WORRIES ABOUT REIGNITING INFLATION
49vc0201 THE DELAY IS A VICTORY ALBEIT TEMPORARY FOR MR. TRUMP WHO OWNS TWO ATLANTIC CITY CASINO HOTELS
49vc0202 BALLY'S AGREEMENT TO BUY THE GOLDEN NUGGET IS WIDELY PERCEIVED AS AN EFFORT TO SCUTTLE A TAKEOVER ATTEMPT BY MR. TRUMP
49vc0203 MR. TRUMP'S DEMAND THAT THE GOLDEN NUGGET PURCHASE BE BLOCKED CAME AS PART OF A COUNTERSUIT HE FILED AGAINST BALLY IN DECEMBER CHALLENGING A BALLY FINANCIAL RESTRUCTURING PLAN
49vc0204 BALLY HAD EARLIER SUED MR. TRUMP ALLEGING VARIOUS SECURITIES LAW VIOLATIONS
49vc0205 THE OUTLOOK IN THE SENATE IS STILL CLOUDY AS LONG AS PRESIDENT REAGAN CONTINUES TO OPPOSE A TAX BOOST
49vc0206 <NOISE> STILL SENATE BUDGET WRITERS ARE INCLUDING A SIGNIFICANT REVENUE INCREASE IN THEIR DEFICIT REDUCTION PACKAGE
49vc0207 SUCH A BUDGET ITEM WOULD FORCE THE SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE TO COME UP WITH A TAX INCREASE OF SOME KIND
49vc0208 <NOISE> THE HYUNDAI THAT NIFTY AND CHEAP LITTLE KOREAN CAR HAS CAUGHT ON IN THE UNITED STATES AND NO DOUBT COULD COMPETE IN ANY MARKET IN THE WORLD
49vc0209 SO OUR WILLIAM MCGURN INQUIRED INTO HOW MANY HAVE BEEN EXPORTED FROM KOREA TO JAPAN
49vc020a HE FOUND THAT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX THE NUMBER WAS ZERO
49vc020b THIS WAS DOWN FROM NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE WHEN EXPORTS REACHED ONE SOLD TO MITSUBISHI
49vc020c EXPORTS LOST TO TOUGHER COMPETITION ABROAD AND MORE IMPORTS INTO THE UNITED STATES MARKET HAVE CAUSED MANY FARMERS TO ABANDON THEIR TRADITIONAL FAITH IN FREE TRADE
49vc020d FROM SUGAR LONG PROTECTED TO WHEAT TO FLOWERS FARMERS ARE DEMANDING THAT BORDERS BE CLOSED
49vc020e THE LOSERS PARTICULARLY IN SUGAR ARE MANY OF THE LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES WHOSE DESPERATE ECONOMIES THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT IS OTHERWISE TRYING TO SALVAGE
49vc020f TOTAL PRIVATE CONSTRUCTION INCREASED ONE POINT SEVEN PERCENT IN AUGUST AFTER A POINT FOUR PERCENT DROP IN JULY
49vc020g OUTLAYS FOR PUBLIC BUILDING INCREASED POINT NINE PERCENT AFTER A ONE POINT TWO PERCENT RISE
49vc020h OVERALL AUGUST OUTLAYS WERE ONE POINT ONE PERCENT ABOVE A YEAR EARLIER
49vc020i THE HUGE GAP TO A LARGE EXTENT IS A PRICE PHENOMENON
49vc020j THE DOLLAR'S FALL HAS PUSHED UP THE PRICE OF IMPORTS CAUSING THE DEFICIT TO SWELL EVEN AS THE VOLUME OF NON OIL IMPORTS HAS RECEDED
49vc020k BUT LONG BEFORE NOW THESE HIGHER PRICES WERE SUPPOSED TO LEAD TO IMPROVEMENT IN THE MONTHLY MERCHANDISE TRADE DEFICIT AS WELL
49vc020l THE JOURNAL NEVER CAN BE ALL THINGS TO ALL READERS
49vc020m IT DOESN'T TRY TO BE
49vc020n WE ARE NOT PLANNING SPORTS SECTIONS OR LOCAL NEWS COVERAGE COLORED WEATHER MAPS OR STORIES ON EVERY MINOR CRISIS IN THE WORLD
49vc020o WE DO INTEND TO REMAIN AMERICA'S NATIONAL BUSINESS DAILY AND WITH OUR EXPANDING ASIAN AND EUROPEAN EDITIONS THE GLOBAL BUSINESS DAILY AS WELL
49vc020p THAT MEANS FOCUSING FIRMLY ON NEWS THAT BUSY BUSINESS PEOPLE TRULY NEED
49vc020q STILL COMPANY INSIDERS SAID THE RESTRUCTURING WAS ENTIRELY MR. AKERS'S PLAN AND WASN'T FORCED ON HIM BY THE I. B. M. BOARD
49vc020r A DIRECTOR SAID THE BOARD LEARNED OF THE PLAN AT ITS MEETING LAST TUESDAY
49vc020s JOHN FOUND EVERYTHING WAS COMING ONTO HIS DESK AND HE HAD MORE THAN HE COULD COPE WITH ANOTHER DIRECTOR SAID
49vc020t HE WANTED AN ORGANIZATION WHICH RESOLVED MORE PROBLEMS BEFORE THEY GOT TO HIM
49vc020u FARM FUTURES PRICES HAVE FALLEN SEVERAL TIMES IN THE PAST TWO WEEKS FOLLOWING SEVERAL WEEKS OF A DROUGHT INSPIRED RALLY
49vc020v YESTERDAY'S TRADING SEEMED TO SUPPORT THE NOTION AMONG SOME ANALYSTS THAT CORN AND WHEAT FUTURES ARE TOP HEAVY
49vc020w THE MARKET HAS BEEN OVERDONE SIGNIFICANTLY ON THE UPSIDE DOWN SAID RICHARD LOEWY SENIOR GRAIN AND OIL SEED ANALYST WITH PRUDENTIAL BACHE SECURITIES INC.
49vc020x THE PIPER HAS TO BE PAID ON THE OTHER SIDE
49vc020y MR. PEROT TOLD TEXAS OFFICIALS LAST MONTH THAT HIS NEW COMPANY WOULD BID AGAINST E. D. S. TO PROCESS ABOUT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IN MEDICAID CLAIMS
49vc020z THUS MR. PEROT PUT INTO PLAY A CONTRACT THAT E. D. S. HAS HELD EXCLUSIVELY SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN
49vc0210 THE CONTRACT EXPIRES NEXT YEAR
49vc0211 THE INDICTMENTS ALLEGE THAT MESSRS.
49vc0212 MARTINO AND ORLOFF APPROVED MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR WORK DONE LARGELY BY HANLEY WORLDWIDE
49vc0213 THEY RECEIVED PAYMENTS IN CASH AND IN THE FORM OF CLOTHES CLUB MEMBERSHIPS AND PAYMENT OF PERSONAL BILLS ACCORDING TO THE CHARGES
49vc0214 N. B. C.'S T. V. COVERAGE ALSO GETS ITS SHARE OF THE BLAME
49vc0215 MARKETERS SAY THAT IT WAS SO BLAND AND SKIPPED SO FREQUENTLY FROM ONE EVENT TO ANOTHER THAT THERE WAS LITTLE CHANCE FOR EXCITEMENT TO BUILD
49vc0216 THE CONSTANT COMMERCIAL INTERRUPTIONS WHICH LED TO RATINGS THAT WERE MUCH LOWER THAN EXPECTED DIDN'T HELP EITHER
49vc0217 THE REHABILITATION PROCESS IS CERTAINLY FURTHER ALONG
49vc0218 THERE'S LESS LOOKING BACK AND MORE LOOKING FORWARD NOW MR. LEFEVRE SAID
49vc0219 PEOPLE ARE FOCUSING MORE ON THE ELECTION AND THE POST ELECTION PERIOD WHAT IT MIGHT MEAN FOR THE ECONOMY
49vc021a ONE OF THE AFFINITY CARDS THAT CHEMICAL BANK DROPPED WAS MARKETED TO ALUMNI OF NEW YORK UNIVERSITY
49vc021b <NOISE> WE WERE SATISFIED WITH THE PROGRAM WHILE IT WAS RUNNING SAYS ROBERT CUNNINGHAM DIRECTOR OF ALUMNI RELATIONS AT N. Y. U.
49vc021c BUT IT ENDED AT CHEMICAL'S SUGGESTION
49vc021d WE ARE EXTREMELY SELECTIVE SAID PAUL SUCKOW DIRECTOR OF FIXED INCOME AT OPPENHEIMER MANAGEMENT CORPORATION
49vc021e I DON'T THINK SOME ISSUES ARE GOING TO MAKE IT HE SAID
49vc021f EVEN CAUTIOUS MANAGERS SUCH AS MR. SUCKOW ARE SEEING THE IMPACT OF THE CAMPEAU DEBACLE
49vc021g HE SAID HIS FIRM OWNS A SMALL AMOUNT OF THE FEDERATED SENIOR DEBT
49vc021h ALTHOUGH THE BONDS ARE SECURED BY BANK CREDITS THEY HAVE ALSO FALLEN IN PRICE RECENTLY
49vc0301 ANY SUCH AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE AIRLINES AND AIRPORT OPERATORS COULD BE WRITTEN INTO THE CONGRESSIONAL LEGISLATION REAUTHORIZING THE AVIATION TRUST FUND
49vc0302 THE TRUST FUND WHICH IS FINANCED BY TICKET AND FUEL TAXES HELPS PAY FOR F. A. A. OPERATIONS AND PROVIDES GRANTS TO AIRPORTS
49vc0303 SOME HAVE SUGGESTED THAT AIRPORT OPERATORS AS A CONDITION OF ACCEPTING THE GRANTS AGREE TO GIVE UP SOME AUTHORITY IN MAKING NOISE RULES
49vc0304 RAYTHEON DENIED THAT IT'S FREELY GIVING AWAY JOBS
49vc0305 WE AREN'T CRAZY ABOUT OFFSETS BUT WE'D ENTER INTO THEM AS A COMPROMISE BUSINESS ARRANGEMENT IF IT'S THE BEST THAT'S AVAILABLE SAID RAYTHEON SPOKESMAN LAWRENCE MCCRACKEN
49vc0306 HE ADDED THAT THERE WERE ALSO SOME POLITICAL AND NATIONAL SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS BEHIND THE DECISION TO SHARE THE PATRIOT BUSINESS WITH THE THREE UNITED STATES ALLIES
49vc0307 TANDY MADE THE INFORMAL PRODUCT ANNOUNCEMENT AT A REGULAR GATHERING OF ABOUT TWO HUNDRED BUSINESS COMPUTER USERS AT THE COMPANY HEADQUARTERS
49vc0308 THE COMPANY ALSO SAID IT WOULD INTRODUCE ITS FIRST LASER PRINTER THIS YEAR
49vc0309 THE HIGH QUALITY PRINTERS ARE BECOMING A MUST COMPUTING ACCESSORY FOR BUSINESSES
49vc030a FLOATING FAILS WHEN GOVERNMENTS TRY TO ESCAPE FROM THE VERDICT OF THE EXCHANGE MARKETS ON THEIR POLICIES BY RESORTING TO DIRECT CONTROLS OVER TRADE AND CAPITAL FLOWS
49vc030b BECAUSE THIS LATTER THREAT IS NOW SO SEVERE THE WORLD IS RIGHT TO TALK ABOUT INTERNATIONAL MONETARY REFORM IF ONLY AS A DELAYING GAME
49vc030c BUT IDEALISTIC TALK SHOULD NOT DECEIVE STABILIZING EXCHANGE RATES REQUIRES DEPENDENCE AND SUBORDINATION NOT THE FREEDOM FOR EVERYBODY TO DO THEIR OWN THING
49vc030d THERE'S BEEN A COMPLETE TURNAROUND IN SHORT TERM SENTIMENT SAID THOMAS G. GRIBBON A SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT AT NOMURA SECURITIES INTERNATIONAL INC.
49vc030e FOR WEEKS PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TRADING BEARISHLY ON DOLLAR WEAKNESS AND A RISE IN THE C. R. B. INDEX
49vc030f DESPITE THE REVERSAL INVESTORS STILL ARE TAKING A CAUTIOUS STANCE AND USING THE LATEST RALLY AS A SELLING OPPORTUNITY HE ADDED
49vc030g THE *FUND* NUVEEN MUNICIPAL VALUE FUND INC. IS BEING CO MANAGED BY ALEX
49vc030h BROWN AND SONS INC. AND JOHN NUVEEN AND COMPANY
49vc030i IT'S BEING SOLD THROUGH A SYNDICATE OF ABOUT A HUNDRED UNDERWRITERS ACCORDING TO A NUVEEN SPOKESWOMAN
49vc030j THE FUND WILL LIKELY BEGIN TRADING ON THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE THIS WEEK NUVEEN ADDED
49vc030k NOT LONG AGO TENNECO WAS CONSIDERED AN UNLIKELY RESTRUCTURING CANDIDATE
49vc030l ITS HEAVY DEBTS AND DEPRESSED ENERGY AND FARM EQUIPMENT BUSINESSES MADE IT APPEAR IMMUNE TO RAIDERS
49vc030m BUT THE COMPANY'S IMPROVING BUSINESS PROSPECTS AND ASSET VALUES HAVE CHANGED THAT
49vc030n WESTERN ANALYSTS HAVE LONG BELIEVED THAT PAKISTAN IS AT LEAST CLOSE TO POSSESSING THE NECESSARY MATERIALS AND KNOWLEDGE TO BUILD AND TEST A BOMB
49vc030o THE COUNTRY HAS REFUSED TO SIGN THE NUCLEAR NON PROLIFERATION TREATY UNLESS RIVAL INDIA WHICH EXPLODED ITS FIRST NUCLEAR DEVICE IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR DOES SO
49vc030p PAKISTAN HAS PROPOSED VARIOUS NON PROLIFERATION CONTROLS ON ITS PROGRAM BUT ONLY IF INDIA AGREES TO THE SAME CONTROLS
49vc030q YESTERDAY PEOPLE CLOSE TO FEDERATED'S BOARD SAID THAT THE COMPANY WAS STILL OPEN TO YET ANOTHER FRIENDLY MERGER PROPOSAL FROM CAMPEAU
49vc030r IF THEY'VE GOT SOMETHING TO SHOW US WE'LL TAKE A LOOK AT IT
49vc030s THEY KNOW WHERE TO FIND US SAID ONE SOURCE
49vc030t WE'RE NOT STONEWALLING THEM
49vc030u THE EGYPTIANS WERE UNHAPPY WITH MANY OF THE RESTRICTIONS ON THEIR PARTICIPATION BUT NEVERTHELESS OPTED FOR THE M. ONE OVER ALTERNATIVES FROM BRITAIN FRANCE AND BRAZIL
49vc030v THE BOTTOM LINE WAS THAT THEY COULD ONLY USE OUR GRANTS TO BUY IN SAID AN ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL
49vc030w IT'S NOT GOING TO COST THEM A THING
49vc030x HIS INABILITY TO RECOVER FROM OCTOBER'S MARKET PLUNGE WAS TRACED TO A HOSTILE BID FROM TWO RIVAL FINANCIERS FOR BELL RESOURCES LIMITED WHICH IS CONTROLLED BY BELL GROUP
49vc030y THE BID FORCED MR. HOLMES A COURT TO CALL OFF A PROPOSED MERGER OF THE BELL COMPANIES
49vc030z THAT WAS THE TURNING POINT SAID DARRYL SMALLEY A DIRECTOR AT THE PERTH BROKERAGE HARTLEY POYNTON LIMITED
49vc0310 FRANKFURT SHARE PRICES RETREATED ACROSS THE BOARD IN MODERATELY ACTIVE TRADING AS THE DAY EARLIER DECLINE ON WALL STREET AND WEAKER DOLLAR PROMPTED WIDESPREAD PROFIT TAKING
49vc0311 BUT EQUITIES RECOVERED SOME OF THEIR EARLIER LOSSES LATE IN THE SESSION AND MOST PRICES CLOSED ONLY SLIGHTLY LOWER
49vc0312 THE MARKET'S BULLISH MOMENTUM IS STILL INTACT TRADERS SAID CITING A FLURRY OF LATE BUY ORDERS
49vc0313 AT THE CENTER OF THE CONTROVERSY IS A PROPOSED SIXTH NUCLEAR PLANT NEAR BASEL AT KAISERAUGST A FORMER ROMAN SETTLEMENT ON THE RHINE

49vc0315 SOME ONE POINT TWO BILLION SWISS FRANCS EIGHT HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS HAD ALREADY BEEN SPENT ON THE PROJECT
49vc0316 WHAT BOTHERS THESE PEOPLE IS NOT THAT MRS. THATCHER POSES A DANGER TO THE SO CALLED UNIFIED EUROPEAN MARKET
49vc0317 MRS. THATCHER IS NOT OPPOSED TO THIS
49vc0318 BRITAIN'S OWN MARKETS ARE MORE OPEN THAN THOSE OF MOST EUROPEAN COUNTRIES LONDON IS WAY AHEAD OF THEM ON CAPITAL MOVEMENT HAVING ABOLISHED EXCHANGE CONTROLS ALTOGETHER
49vc0319 THE CAUSE OF THE OUTRAGE IS THAT EUROPEAN UNITY IS THE DEVICE THROUGH WHICH THE REGULATORS AND SOCIALISTS HOPE TO EXPAND THEIR GRIP ON THE CONTINENT
49vc031a RATES ARE DETERMINED BY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PURCHASE PRICE AND FACE VALUE
49vc031b THUS HIGHER BIDDING NARROWS THE INVESTOR'S RETURN WHILE LOWER BIDDING WIDENS IT
49vc031c THE PERCENTAGE RATES ARE CALCULATED ON A THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY DAY YEAR WHILE THE COUPON EQUIVALENT YIELD IS BASED ON A THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE DAY YEAR
49vc0401 LAST YEAR SPONSORS OF A STRONG ACID RAIN BILL CLAIMED TO HAVE A TENTATIVE ONE VOTE MAJORITY ON THE COMMITTEE IN FAVOR OF THEIR BILL
49vc0402 THE MEASURE WAS CO SPONSORED BY ONE THIRD OF THE HOUSE AND SUPPORT APPEARED TO BE GROWING

49wc0201 THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD IN WASHINGTON HAS LOST TRACK OF A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE POINT NINE BILLION
49wc0202 ITS TRACKERS FIGURE THAT AMERICAN ADULTS HAVE EIGHTEEN BILLION IN THEIR POCKETS AND AROUND THE HOUSE
49wc0203 BUT THAT IS ONLY ABOUT TWELVE PERCENT OF THE BILLS AND LOOSE CHANGE THEY CAN'T DIRECTLY ACCOUNT FOR
49wc0204 AT ONE STAGE EARLY YESTERDAY BEFORE THE DOLLAR HAD RECOVERED THE LATEST THIRTY YEAR TREASURY BOND'S YIELD SURGED TO NEARLY EIGHT AND SEVEN EIGHTHS PERCENT
49wc0205 IT LATER FELL TO EIGHT POINT SIX FOUR PERCENT FROM EIGHT POINT SEVEN PERCENT FRIDAY

49wc0207 PRECIOUS METAL PRICES ALSO STAGED A BIG REVERSAL WITH GOLD PRICES FIRST SOARING THROUGH MIDMORNING AND THEN LATER PLUNGING
49wc0208 THE THIRTY EIGHT YEAR OLD DOCTRINE A CREATION OF THE F. C. C. REQUIRES BROADCASTERS AIRING CONTROVERSIAL MATERIALS TO GIVE OPPONENTS FREE AIR TIME TO RESPOND
49wc0209 SUPPORTERS OF THE DOCTRINE SAY IT ENSURES THAT MINORITY VIEWPOINTS RECEIVE A HEARING ON TELEVISION AND RADIO
49wc020a BUT DETRACTORS SAY THE REQUIREMENT VIOLATES THE FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS OF BROADCASTERS AND INHIBITS THEM FROM RUNNING PROVOCATIVE PROGRAMS
49wc020b NOT LONG AGO TENNECO WAS CONSIDERED AN UNLIKELY RESTRUCTURING CANDIDATE
49wc020c ITS HEAVY DEBTS AND DEPRESSED ENERGY AND FARM EQUIPMENT BUSINESSES MADE IT APPEAR IMMUNE TO RAIDERS
49wc020d BUT THE COMPANY'S IMPROVING BUSINESS PROSPECTS AND ASSET VALUES HAVE CHANGED THAT
49wc020e IN YOUR ARTICLE YOU NOTED THAT A COMPANY'S HISTORY OFTEN JUST WALKS OUT THE DOOR WHEN KEY EMPLOYEES RETIRE OR MOVE ON TO OTHER JOBS
49wc020f THE FIRMS WE HAVE WORKED WITH HAVE ALL BEEN DETERMINED TO AVOID THIS FORM OF CORPORATE AMNESIA
49wc020g ALTHOUGH NOT ALL OF OUR CLIENTS HAVE EXTENSIVE ARCHIVES THEY HAVE ALL RECOGNIZED THE VALUE OF HAVING A CORPORATE ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM
49wc020h UNFAIR OR NOT THE QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN ASKED ABOUT BOTH THE REVOLUTION'S ROUTE AND ITS GOALS HOW MUCH VIOLENCE WILL THERE BE
49wc020i WILL WHITES HAVE POLITICAL RIGHTS
49wc020j HOW MANY WHITES WILL LOSE THEIR JOBS
49wc020k HOW COMMUNIST IS THE A. N. C.
49wc020l HOW MUCH WILL THE GOVERNMENT CONTROL THE ECONOMY
49wc020m STEW LEONARD WHO RUNS STEW LEONARD'S A LARGE GROCERY STORE IN NORWALK CONNECTICUT ACCOMMODATED ALL FOUR OF HIS CHILDREN THIS WAY
49wc020n HE FIRST NAMED HIS OLDEST SON PRESIDENT
49wc020o THEN HE SET UP A BAKERY BUSINESS IN THE STORE FOR HIS DAUGHTER
49wc020p FOR HIS YOUNGER SON HE CREATED AN OPEN AIR FARMER'S MARKET IN DANBURY CONNECTICUT WHERE HE ALSO IS BUILDING A SUPERMARKET FOR THE SON TO RUN <NOISE>
49wc020q AND MR. LEONARD'S OTHER DAUGHTER
49wc020r SHE BECAME DIRECTOR OF THE COMPANY'S HUMAN RESOURCES DEPARTMENT
49wc020s MS. *SAVITCH* WAS HYPER AMBITIOUS TROUBLED AND UNPOPULAR
49wc020t SHE HAD CHARM IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA AN EXPERTLY CRAFTED FACADE BUT INSIDE SHE WAS IN TURMOIL

49wc020w THE INTERIOR MINISTER SAID AT LEAST TWENTY STRIKES HAVE BROKEN OUT AND AUTHORITIES EXTENDED A CURFEW AND DETAINED FORTY NINE PEOPLE NATIONWIDE
49wc020x SOME WORKERS ENDED STRIKES YESTERDAY BUT OTHERS PREPARED FOR ASSAULTS BY TROOPS AND RIOT POLICE
49wc020y MR. WEILL SAYS THE THEORY BEHIND THE COMBINATION IS DEVELOPING MULTIPLE MEANS OF SELLING SIMILAR PRODUCTS
49wc020z OTHER COMPANIES ARE APPLYING THIS STRATEGY WITH VARYING DEGREES OF SUCCESS BUT NONE HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY HAPPY WITH THE RESULTS
49wc0210 MR. WEILL'S ALMA MATER AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY HAS SOLD OFF MOST OF ITS INSURANCE BUSINESSES AND FORTY PERCENT OF ITS SECURITIES UNIT SHEARSON LEHMAN HUTTON INCORPORATED
49wc0211 DANIEL J. GILMARTIN WAS NAMED PRESIDENT AND CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER OF FRANK'S NURSERY AND CRAFTS DETROIT A UNIT OF ITS SPECIALTY RETAILER

49wc0213 MR. GILMARTIN HAD BEEN DIRECTOR CORPORATE PLANNING FOR THE PARENT COMPANY
49wc0214 BUT AFTER FIVE YEARS OF DECLINE UNIT LABOR COSTS HAVE BEGUN TO EDGE UP AMONG MANUFACTURERS
49wc0215 WAGES AND BENEFITS THIS YEAR HAVE BEEN RISING AT NEARLY DOUBLE NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN'S TWO POINT ONE PERCENT RATE SLIGHTLY EXCEEDING THE GAIN IN PRODUCTIVITY
49wc0216 AS A RESULT MANUFACTURERS' UNIT LABOR COSTS IN THE THIRD QUARTER CREPT UP POINT SEVEN PERCENT FROM A YEAR EARLIER THE LABOR DEPARTMENT REPORTED YESTERDAY
49wc0217 THE INESCAPABLE FACT HOWEVER <NOISE> IS THAT ONE DAY THE WATER IS GOING TO RUN OUT OR BECOME TOO EXPENSIVE TO PUMP UP
49wc0218 WE'RE GOING TO SEE LESS PRODUCTION
49wc0219 THERE'S NO WAY AROUND IT SAYS KANSAS STATE EXTENSION ECONOMIST MARK NELSON
49wc021a BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE A CATACLYSMIC THING
49wc021b FOR FOREIGN SECURITIES FIRMS AS WITH ANY BUSINESS HERE PATIENCE IS A KEY TO SUCCESS
49wc021c MOST OF THOSE SUCCEEDING HAVE STUCK IT OUT THROUGH DEFICITS
49wc021d MERRILL LYNCH WAS THE FIRST FOREIGN FIRM TO SET UP SHOP IN JAPAN IN NINETEEN SIXTY ONE AND IT SAYS *LONGEVITY* PAYS BIG DIVIDENDS
49wc021e IT IS THE FOREIGN SECURITIES FIRM THAT IS THE MOST WIDELY RECOGNIZED BY JAPANESE INVESTORS
49wc021f WITH RETAIL OFFICES IN FIVE JAPANESE CITIES MERRILL LYNCH IS THE ONLY FOREIGN FIRM THAT EARNS SIGNIFICANT PROFITS FROM ITS RETAIL AND PRIVATE CLIENT BUSINESSES
49wc021g IT WASN'T ALWAYS EASY BUT IT'S WORKED OUT VERY WELL FOR US SAYS RANDY HARRIS THE FIRM'S PRESIDENT IN JAPAN
49wc0301 THE AUTO MAKER SAYS THE WAGON VERSION OF THE MEDALLION WILL HAVE A BASE PRICE OF TEN THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND NINETY THREE DOLLARS
49wc0302 THE X. L. VERSION OF THE SEDAN WILL START AT TEN THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY NINE DOLLARS

49wc0304 J. WALTER THOMPSON WILL RETAIN FORD'S U. S. CAR AND TRUCK ACCOUNTS FOR WHICH IT CREATED THE *UBIQUITOUS* HAVE YOU DRIVEN A FORD LATELY CAMPAIGN
49wc0305 IT ALSO WILL RETAIN SMALLER FORD ACCOUNTS IN SIX OTHER COUNTRIES AND IT CONTINUES TO BE FORD'S LARGEST AGENCY
49wc0306 BUT INDUSTRY SOURCES SAY THEY BELIEVE FORD WAS CONSIDERING GIVING ONE OF THOSE SIX ACCOUNTS FOR FORD'S LATIN AMERICAN AFFILIATE TO ANOTHER AGENCY
49wc0307 INDEED WITHIN DAYS OF ITS RE ELECTION MR. HAWKE'S GOVERNMENT HAS ANNOUNCED WHOLESALE CHANGES IN THE AUSTRALIAN PUBLIC SERVICE
49wc0308 THE EXISTING STRUCTURE WILL BE RATIONALIZED AND THE NUMBER OF DEPARTMENTS REDUCED FROM TWENTY SEVEN TO SEVENTEEN
49wc0309 MR. HAWKE AND MR. KEATING NOW ARE PREPARING FOR THE SALE OF GOVERNMENT ASSETS ON A GRAND SCALE
49wc030a SIGNS OF CHANGE ARE EVERYWHERE
49wc030b ALTHOUGH FEW FIRMS ADMIT TO STAFF CUTS MANY ARE QUIETLY PRUNING THEIR RANKS
49wc030c MANY HAVE SHIFT THEIR SPECIALISTS IN TAX EXEMPT HOUSING BONDS WHERE ACTIVITY IS PARTICULARLY LOW TO THEIR MORTGAGE BACKED BOND OPERATIONS
49wc030d DOUG IS MUCH MORE AGGRESSIVE IN THE MARKETPLACE SAYS JAMES E. SORENSON BATTELLE'S SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT FOR MANUFACTURING
49wc030e HE GETS OUT AND HAS ONE ON ONE MEETINGS WITH CHIEF EXECUTIVES OF COMPANIES AND LEARNS WHERE THE MARKET IS GOING
49wc030f BATTELLE MUST ANTICIPATE COMMERCIAL DEMAND FIVE TO EIGHT YEARS AHEAD MR. SORENSON ADDS
49wc030g KEMP'S CAMPAIGN TAKES ON AN INCREASINGLY DESPERATE TONE
49wc030h IN ONE SURE SIGN OF A CANDIDACY IN TROUBLE HE LASHES OUT AT A CRITICISM FROM A LIGHTLY REGARDED T. V. COMMENTATOR
49wc030i EVEN SOME SUPPORTERS NOW SAY PRIVATELY THAT HE SHOULD AIM FOR THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION
49wc030j BUT HIS LONGTIME HOSTILITIES WITH *DOLE* LEAVE A SPOT ON A BUSH TICKET AS ABOUT THE ONLY POSSIBILITY
49wc030k PROFESSIONAL CORPORATIONS
49wc030l TAXES WOULD GO UP FOR CORPORATIONS CONSISTING OF LAWYERS DOCTORS ACCOUNTANTS AND ARCHITECTS
49wc030m THE PROVISION WOULD ELIMINATE GRADUATED RATES FOR THESE PERSONAL SERVICE CORPORATIONS SO THAT THEY ALL WOULD PAY THE FLAT THIRTY FOUR CORPORATE RATE
49wc030n MR. NG AND BOTH STANDARD CHARTERED UNITS HAVE REFUSED TO COMMENT ON THE CASE
49wc030o MR. NG FORMERLY WAS DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF UNITED OVERSEAS BANK THE SECOND LARGEST BANK HOLDING COMPANY IN SINGAPORE
49wc030p IT HASN'T BEEN CHARGED WITH ANY WRONGDOING
49wc030q I HAVE NO DOUBT THOUGH THAT THE TRUST OF FED POLICY WILL BE MORE TOWARDS EASE THAN RESTRAINT MR. ROBERTSON ADDS
49wc030r FED OFFICIALS WILL BE MUCH MORE INCLINED TO ERR ON THE SIDE OF EASE
49wc030s SO I THINK THE FED FUNDS RATE WILL BE AT SIX POINT FIVE PERCENT TO SIX POINT SEVEN FIVE PERCENT FOR THE NEXT SIXTY DAYS
49wc030t THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD ADDRESSED THE ISSUE IN BANCA COMMERCIALE'S PURCHASE OF LONG ISLAND TRUST COMPANY IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO
49wc030u THE FED APPROVED THE PURCHASE AS IT HAS CLEARED SEVERAL SIMILAR TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING SMALLER BANKS BOUGHT BY GOVERNMENT CONTROLLED FOREIGN INTERESTS IN THE PAST
49wc030v THE FED APPROVAL TOOK FIFTEEN MONTHS AND THE BOARD SERVED NOTICE THAT THE LONG ISLAND TRUST CASE INVOLVED SIGNIFICANT AND COMPLEX PROBLEMS
49wc030w IT ADDED THAT MORE EXTENSIVE ANALYSIS AND BROADER PARTICIPATION ARE NEEDED TO RESOLVE PUBLIC POLICY ISSUES
49wc030x IN AN UNLIKELY TWIST CURRENT FARM LAW MAY FORCE HIM TO RETURN MONEY HE HAS ALREADY RECEIVED FROM THE GOVERNMENT
49wc030y HE GOT A FOUR THOUSAND DOLLAR CHECK IN THE SPRING AS AN ADVANCE ON THE PRICE SUPPORT SUBSIDIES HE WAS PROMISED FOR HIS FALL CROP
49wc030z BUT NOW THAT THE PRICES HAVE GONE UP SO SHARPLY HE MAY NO LONGER QUALIFY FOR THE SUBSIDY
49wc0310 IN THAT EVENT HE MAY NOT JUST HAVE TO RETURN HIS SPRING CHECK BUT ALSO WOULDN'T BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE USUAL POST HARVEST MONEY
49wc0311 FOR THE NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN THIRD QUARTER THE MAGAZINE GROUP HAD PRETAX EARNINGS OF SIX POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS ON REVENUE OF FIFTY NINE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS
49wc0312 THE EXPECTED EARNINGS DROP REFLECTS ONE FEWER ISSUE IN THE QUARTER OF FAMILY CIRCLE
49wc0313 ALSO THE COMPANY CITED DEVELOPMENT COSTS FOR THREE NEW MAGAZINES
49wc0314 WORLD OIL PRICES WERE STILL WELL ABOVE THEIR NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX LEVELS YESTERDAY BUT MARKETS REMAINED WEAK NEVERTHELESS

49wc0317 MOANS STAN TRILLING A LIFETIME O. T. C. STOCKBROKER AT PAINEWEBBER INCORPORATED IN LOS ANGELES IT'S LIKE I KNOW THERE'S A PARADE OUT THERE
49wc0318 I CAN HEAR THE BAND MARCHING BY
49wc0319 BUT THEY WON'T LET ME IN THE PARADE
49wc031a THE OVERALL MARKET IS BEING DRIVEN BY THESE BIG CAP TAKEOVER STOCKS BUT I'M NOT PARTICIPATING
49wc031b ON AUGUST TWENTY THIRD THE U. S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA UPHELD THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY'S APPROVAL OF THE PURCHASE OF THE INSURANCE COMPANY
49wc031c THE COMPTROLLER HAD FOUND THAT MULTIPLE BOND INSURANCE IS FUNCTIONAL THE SAME AS BANKS' STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT
49wc031d HOWEVER THE COURT SAID THAT CITICORP NEEDED THE FED'S PERMISSION AS WELL AS THE COMPTROLLER'S TO MAKE THE ACQUISITION
49wc0401 THE OPERATING RATE IS STILL KIND OF LOW BUT IT'S COMING BACK SAID PRISCILLA LUCE SENIOR ECONOMIST AT WHARTON *ECONOMETRIC* FORECASTING ASSOCIATES IN PHILADELPHIA

49wc0405 ALTHOUGH IT WILL RETAIN CONTROL INDUSTRIAL EQUITY IS PLANNING TO TAKE HIGBEE PUBLIC AGAIN PROBABLY IN JUNE
49wc0406 MEANWHILE SAYS MR. BOARDBENT THEY'VE MADE US MORE INQUISITIVE ABOUT ACQUISITIONS OURSELVES
49wc0407 STILL HE WOULD PREFER THERE BE NO BIDS AT ALL
49wc0408 THE COMPANY'S POLICY FOR EIGHTY FIVE YEARS HAS BEEN TO BE INDEPENDENT AND GROW AND WE HAVE SUCCEEDED HE SAYS
49wc0409 WE ARE EVALUATING THE OFFERS FOR THE COMPANY AND FOR THE SHAREHOLDERS BUT WE PROFOUNDLY REGRET THE SITUATION
49wc040a MEANWHILE THE AGENCY SAID IT WILL CONDUCT A STUDY ON ITS OWN
49wc040b OFFICIALS SAID THE REVIEW MAY LEAD TO NEW REGULATIONS FOR DATA PROCESSING SYSTEMS
49wc040c THE AGENCY MAY ALSO CHALLENGE PAST CHARGES TO THE PENTAGON
49wc040d PENTAGON OFFICIALS SAY THE REVIEW LIKELY WILL TAKE AT LEAST A YEAR
49wc040e THE GOVERNMENT CIVIL SUIT ALLEGED THAT A DEFECT COULD CAUSE THE REAR BRAKES TO LOCK SENDING THE CAR SPINNING OUT OF CONTROL
49wc040f G. M. WHICH NO LONGER MAKES X. CARS DENIED THAT THE BRAKES WERE DEFECTIVE
49wc040g AGREEING WITH G. M. JUDGE JACKSON RULED THAT THE GOVERNMENT CAME TO COURT WITH NOTHING MORE ESSENTIALLY THAN A REASONABLE SUSPICION THAT A DEFECT EXISTED
49wc040h ROYAL BANK IS CONSIDERED A LEADING SUITOR TO ACQUIRE WOOD GUNDY IF FIRST CHICAGO CORPORATION WITHDRAWS FROM ITS AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE A THIRTY FIVE PERCENT STAKE
49wc040i AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED FIRST CHICAGO IS RECONSIDERING THE INVESTMENT BECAUSE OF LOSSES WOOD GUNDY IS EXPECTED TO INCUR FROM THE RECENT BRITISH PETROLEUM LIMITED SHARE ISSUE

49wc040o THE KOREAN AIR JET WITH A HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN PEOPLE ABOARD WAS EN ROUTE TO SEOUL FROM BAGHDAD WHEN AVIATION OFFICIALS LOST CONTACT WITH THE PLANE
49wc040p K. A. L. OFFICIALS WON'T RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF HIJACKING OR SABOTAGE
49wc040q MR. POEHL LISTED SEVERAL REASONS FOR THE DOLLAR'S IMPROVED PROSPECTS
49wc040r AMERICAN EXPORTS HAVE DONE REAL WELL IN REAL TERMS HE EXPLAINED I THINK THAT'S GOING TO CONTINUE
49wc040s AT THE SAME TIME IMPORTS BY JAPAN AND EUROPE ESPECIALLY WEST GERMANY HAVE BEEN SPEEDING UP
49wc040t THESE TRENDS HE SAID ARE REDRESSING THE TRADE IMBALANCES THAT HELPED PROVOKE THE DOLLAR'S FALL
49wc040u I DON'T WANT TO BE *EUPHORIC* YOU KNOW BUT I THINK IT'S UNDER WAY
49wc040v MR. POEHL ADDED
49wc040w IN KEY DAIRY STATES MILK PRODUCTION ROSE SHARPLY DURING THE PROGRAM
49wc040x IN CALIFORNIA PRODUCTION INCREASED TWO POINT EIGHT PERCENT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX AND SIX POINT NINE PERCENT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
49wc040y IN TEXAS IT WAS UP THREE PERCENT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX AND EIGHT POINT FOUR PERCENT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
49wc040z BANKAMERICA OFFICIALS HOPE THAT LIKE THE EARLIER PROBLEMS THE IMPROVING FINANCES WILL FEED ON THEMSELVES
49wc0410 IT IS COUNTING ON A STRONGER CREDIT RATING TO ALLOW IT TO BECOME MORE THAN A MINOR LEAGUER IN PITCHING LUCRATIVE INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY SWAPS
49wc0411 MONEY TO PROMOTE A FLAGGING GLOBAL CORPORATE COMPUTER SERVICE IS BECOMING AVAILABLE
49wc0412 SO IS SUPPORT FOR A BEEFED UP TEAM OF DEAL MAKERS TO BROKER MERGERS AMONG CALIFORNIA COMPANIES
49wc0413 NONE OF THESE AREAS HOWEVER HOLD THE PROSPECT OF QUICK GROWTH
49wc0414 PRICES OF SOME ACTIVELY TRADED THIRTY YEAR BONDS ROSE QUARTER A POINT OR TWO DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS FOR EACH ONE THOUSAND DOLLAR FACE AMOUNT
49wc0415 THE YIELD HOVERED AT NINE POINT OH THREE PERCENT

49wc0418 INDUSTRIELLE OUT OF ITS CASH HOARD OR THROUGH SHORT TERM LOANS
49wc0419 ONE SOURCE SAID SUEZ IF VICTORIOUS WOULD LIKELY RESELL PART OF ITS STAKE IN CIE
49wc041a INDUSTRIELLE TO RECOUP PART OF ITS COSTS
49wc041b IT COULD ALSO SELL OFF CIE
49wc041c INDUSTRIELLE ASSETS SUCH AS REAL ESTATE AND MINORITY INDUSTRIAL HOLDINGS ESTIMATED AT BETWEEN ONE BILLION AND TWO BILLION FRANCS
49wc041d AIRLINES SAY AIRSPACE HAS BECOME SO CROWDED IN EUROPE THAT ANY AIRLINE MISSING AN ASSIGNED TAKEOFF SLOT MAY HAVE TO WAIT AN HOUR FOR ANOTHER FREE SLOT
49wc041e EACH COUNTRY IN EUROPE ALSO OPERATES ITS OWN AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL SYSTEM AND THIS MAKES THE ENTIRE EUROPEAN AIR SYSTEM VULNERABLE TO THE CONTINENT'S FREQUENT AIR CONTROLLER STRIKES
49wc041f TWO WEEKS AGO FOR INSTANCE A WEEKEND STRIKE BY ENGINEERS WHO CONTROL AIRPLANES IN FLIGHT OVER FRANCE CAUSED HORRENDOUS BACKUPS ON BRITISH FLIGHTS HEADING THROUGH FRENCH AIRSPACE
49xc0201 PAYOFFS TO MOSCOW BY THE WEST COULD RANGE FROM F- SOFTENING HUMAN RIGHTS POLICIES TO EXTENDING CHEAP LOANS TO RELAXING TECHNOLOGY CONTROLS
49xc0202 THE AVAILABLE SOVIET INSTRUMENTS INCLUDE ITS NORTH SEA NAVY ITS MOBILE ARMORED FORCES IN CENTRAL EUROPE AND ITS ARRAY OF CONVENTIONALLY ARMED TACTICAL MISSILES
49xc0203 WHETHER SUCH BLACKMAIL WOULD EVER BE SENSIBLE OR POSSIBLE IS ARGUABLE BUT OFFICIALS LIKE MR. ABSHIRE DON'T WANT MOSCOW TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO TRY
49xc0204 HERE ARE PRICE TRENDS ON THE M- WORLD'S MAJOR STOCK MARKETS AS CALCULATED BY MORGAN STANLEY CAPITAL INTERNATIONAL *PERSPECTIVE* GENEVA
49xc0205 TO MAKE THEM DIRECTLY COMPARABLE EACH INDEX IS BASED ON THE CLOSE OF NINETEEN SIXTY NINE EQUALING ONE HUNDRED
49xc0206 THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE IS SINCE YEAR END
49xc0207 HIS FIRST TEST ON THAT ISSUE WILL BE WHETHER HE CAN PERSUADE THE OPPOSITION TO FIELD A CANDIDATE AGAINST HIM
49xc0208 THE CHIEF OPPOSITION PARTY THE REUNIFICATION AND DEMOCRACY PARTY LED BY KIM YOUNG SAM HAS VOWED IT WON'T PARTICIPATE IN ANY ELECTION UNDER THE CURRENT CONSTITUTION
49xc0209 IT AND THE CO- NATIONAL COALITION FOR A DEMOCRATIC CONSTITUTION A NEWLY FORMED ALLIANCE OF RELIGIOUS AND DISSIDENT GROUPS ARE ORGANIZING TOMORROW'S OPPOSITION RALLIES
49xc020a NOW THE ISSUE IS IN THE HOUSE'S LAP
49xc020b THE TEMPORARY BAN ON NEW BANKING POWERS IS A PROVISION IN THE SENATE VERSION OF A BILL TO RECAPITALIZE THE INSOLVENT FEDERAL SAVINGS AND LOAN INSURANCE CORPORATION
49xc020c THE HOUSE F. S. L. I. C. MEASURE DOESN'T HAVE ANY OTHER PROVISIONS
49xc020d MR. REAGAN'S COMMENTS DON'T REFLECT ANY CHANGE IN HIS IP- INTERPRETATION OF THE DEFICIT REDUCTION AGREEMENT
49xc020e AT THE INSISTENCE OF THE WHITE HOUSE THE PLAN SPECIFICALLY NOTED THAT THE PRESIDENT COULD EITHER SIGN OR VETO THE SPECIFIC TAXES CONGRESS CHOOSES
49xc020f AND THE ADMINISTRATION HAS SAID BEFORE THAT IT ISN'T HAPPY WITH THE PROVISION ON TAKEOVERS
49xc020g EVEN BEFORE MR. GARDINI'S BID FOR THE CHAIRMANSHIP MONTEDISON EXECUTIVES HAD SAID THEY WOULD CONSIDER SELECTIVE DIVESTMENTS OF NON STRATEGIC COMPANIES
49xc020h THE MOST OFTEN MENTIONED IS THE RETAIL CHAIN STANDA S. P. A.
49xc020i STANDA HAS IMPRESSIVE FINANCIAL RESULTS BUT LACKLUSTER EARNINGS ON AN OPERATING LEVEL ACCORDING TO ONE FINANCIAL ANALYST
49xc020j CORRESPONDENT BANKING OR PROVIDING SERVICES TO SMALLER BANKS IS ONE AREA THAT MANUFACTURERS MIGHT LEAVE
49xc020k THE PROFITABILITY OF THAT BUSINESS HAS BEEN DECLINING FOR YEARS MR. WOODEN SAID
49xc020l IT WAS THROUGH THESE CORRESPONDENT BANKS THAT MANUFACTURERS GOT ALL OF THESE ENERGY LOANS THAT HAVE SOURED
49xc020m HOWEVER ONE MANUFACTURERS EXECUTIVE SAID HE DOUBTED CORRESPONDENT BANKING WOULD BE ELIMINATED IN LIGHT OF THAT BUSINESS'S IMPROVED PERFORMANCE RECENTLY
49xc020n GORDON PYE CHIEF ECONOMIST AT IRVING TRUST COMPANY CONTENDS THAT INTEREST RATES MAY DROP FURTHER BUT WILL LURCH BACK UP AGAIN LATER THIS YEAR
49xc020o HE SAYS YIELDS ON LONG TERM TREASURY ISSUES MAY DECLINE TO AS LOW AS EIGHT PERCENT BUT THEN YIELDS WILL START MOVING THE OTHER WAY
49xc020p WE'LL HIT TEN PERCENT A COUPLE OF TIMES AND WE'LL GO PAST IT LATER THIS YEAR
49xc020q WHILE MR. ARROYO WORKED IN PRESIDENT AQUINO'S OFFICE AND SAW HER EVERY DAY MR. ONGPIN WAS STILL HALFWAY AROUND THE WORLD BARGAINING WITH THE BANKERS

49xc020s ON MARCH TWENTY SEVEN MR. ONGPIN REACHED A DEAL
49xc020t THE GOVERNMENT IS NOW PORING OVER MR. SEOW'S FINANCIAL AFFAIRS ASKING HOW HE'S BEEN PAYING HIS PHONE BILLS THESE PAST TEN YEARS
49xc020u SIMILAR INQUIRIES LED TO THE EXPULSION FROM PARLIAMENT LAST DECEMBER OF JOSHUA B. JEYARETNAM LEAVING ONLY ONE OPPOSITION M. P.
49xc020v A TEAM CANDIDATE PROPOSAL NOW UNDER STUDY WOULD ALSO SEEM LIKELY TO KEEP THE OPPOSITION FROM FINDING ITS WAY INTO GOVERNMENT OFFICE
49xc020w BUT SINGAPORE'S TWO POINT SIX MILLION CITIZENS AREN'T LIKELY TO BENEFIT QUITE SO MUCH AS THE POLITICIANS OF MR. LEE'S RULING PARTY
49xc020x INDEED NO CHANGES ARE LIKELY SOON BECAUSE THE WHOLESALERS AND SMALL RETAILERS THAT BENEFIT FROM THE EXISTING SYSTEM ARE WELL ORGANIZED BACKERS OF THE RULING LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY
49xc020y THE JAPANESE DEBATE ON THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM BEGAN ONLY RECENTLY
49xc020z EVEN AFTER A CONSENSUS IS REACHED NEW LEGISLATION MAY HAVE TO BE DRAFTED AND ENACTED
49xc0210 AND MR. BUSH PLEDGES TO MOVE FORWARD ON AN ISSUE THAT HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT TO HIM IN RECENT YEARS A PACT ELIMINATING CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS
49xc0211 IT ISN'T GOING TO BE EASY BECAUSE OF VERIFICATION PROBLEMS MR. BUSH SAYS
49xc0212 BUT THAT REALLY IS A PASSION OF MINE
49xc0213 SCIENTISTS IN GENERAL MUST COME TO TERMS WITH THEIR RELIANCE ON CONGRESS FOR FINANCIAL SUPPORT
49xc0214 SPACE SCIENTISTS NOW COMPETE FOR ATTENTION WITH OTHER BIG SCIENCE PROJECTS AS SUCH AS MAPPING THE HUMAN GENOME OR THE SUPER COLLIDER
49xc0215 IN THE PROCESS ALREADY ESTABLISHED SCIENTISTS IN BASIC RESEARCH FEEL SLIGHTED

49xc021c IF THE CONFERENCE REPORT IS PRESENTED TO ME IN ITS CURRENT FORM HE WROTE I WILL VETO THE BILL
49xc021d VOLKSWAGEN HAS MADE A SIMILAR MOVE IN THE U. S. WHERE IT UNVEILED ITS NEW CORRADO SPORTS COUPE LAST WEEK

49xc030h IN EXCHANGE FOR ITS INTEREST IN ARGO'S OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES SENECA SAID IT WILL REFINANCE SOME OF THE ARGO DEBT
49xc030i IN ADDITION SENECA SAID IT AND THE SUCCESSOR CORPORATION TO ARGO WILL ENTER INTO A JOINT VENTURE TO EXPLORE AND FURTHER DEVELOP THE ARGO PROPERTIES IT IS ACQUIRING
49xc030j BUT SIX YEARS OF HUGE TRADE DEFICITS AND BUDGET DEFICITS HAVE CHANGED ALL THAT
49xc030k BY THE END OF LAST YEAR THE DEPARTMENT SAYS FOREIGNERS HELD TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS MORE THAN U. S. ASSETS THAN AMERICANS HELD OVERSEAS
49xc030l SOME ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS DOUBT THE ACCURACY OF THOSE NUMBERS BUT NO ONE QUESTIONS THE TREND
49xc030m THE COMPLEX PLAN GRADUALLY GIVES THE COMPANY TO THE DEBT HOLDERS SAID CHARLES E. BAYLESS FINANCIAL VICE PRESIDENT
49xc030n IN CONTRAST IF THE UTILITY BEGAN BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS THEY THE DEBT HOLDERS WOULD GET IT RIGHT NOW HE SAID
49xc030o IN EITHER CASE THE INTERESTS OF THE UTILITY'S COMMON SHAREHOLDERS WOULD BE SUBSTANTIALLY DILUTED HE SAID
49xc030p WITH EUROPE HAVING MADE CONCESSIONS TO THE U. S. MR. BAKER AND FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIRMAN *ALAN* GREENSPAN COULD COME UNDER INCREASING PRESSURE TO HELP STEM THE DOLLAR'S RECENT FALL
49xc030q FOR WEEKS THE U. S. CURRENCY HAS BEEN PLUMMETING
49xc030r RATHER THAN RAISE INTEREST RATES TO SUPPORT THE CURRENCY THE FED HAS FOCUSED ON MAINTAINING AMPLE LIQUIDITY TO FEND OFF A RECESSION FOLLOWING THE STOCK MARKET CRASH
49xc030s SOME REPORTERS WERE MORE ORIGINAL

49xc030u THE STRANGEST INQUIRY LOBBED AT BILL WAS WHAT ROLE I SAW AT FORD FOR MY DAUGHTERS WHO ARE TWO YEARS OLD AND TWO MONTHS OLD
49xc030v I THOUGHT THAT WAS KIND OF PUTTING THE CART BEFORE THE HORSE I WANT TO GET THEM OUT OF KINDERGARTEN FIRST
49xc030w LAST YEAR SEVERAL MAJOR CITIES INCLUDING JACKSONVILLE FLORIDA AND CHARLOTTE NORTH CAROLINA PROHIBITED OR SEVERELY RESTRICTED CONSTRUCTION OF NEW OUTDOOR ADVERTISEMENTS
49xc030x JUST LAST MONTH SAINT LOUIS ADOPTED A BILLBOARD BAN
49xc030y AND OFFICIALS IN RICHMOND VIRGINIA AND DENVER ARE CONSIDERING CRACKING DOWN
49xc030z NINETEEN NINETY NINE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN WRITTEN BY A SERVING PRESIDENT
49xc0310 IT IS ALL A PRESIDENT CAN DO TO KEEP UP WITH EVENTS TIME FOR REFLECTION IS A LUXURY BEYOND REACH
49xc0311 NOR IS THERE TIME FOR A PRESIDENT TO LEARN MUCH BEYOND THE KNOWLEDGE WITH WHICH HE COMES TO OFFICE
49xc0312 THAT'S WORTH REMEMBERING WHEN WE THINK NOT ABOUT NINETEEN NINETY NINE BUT ABOUT NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT
49xc0313 FRESH FACES APPEAR AT THE RAINBOW KITCHEN ALMOST DAILY AMONG THEM A YOUNG COUPLE BACK FROM A DISILLUSIONING JOB HUNTING SOJOURN TO THE SUN BELT
49xc0314 THEY EXPECT TO BE ON THEIR FEET IN A MONTH
49xc0315 OTHERS SHOW UP BETWEEN ODD JOBS OR IN THE SUMMER WHEN THEIR CHILDREN CAN'T GET FREE LUNCH AT SCHOOL
49xc0316 MR. DUKAKIS IS IN FACT A FIRST GENERATION AMERICAN
49xc0317 HIS FATHER PANOS ARRIVED IN NEW YORK <*IN*> IN NINETEEN TWELVE AT THE AGE OF SIXTEEN
49xc0318 HIS MOTHER ARRIVED A YEAR LATER WHEN SHE WAS NINE
49xc0319 GOVERNOR DUKAKIS'S AIDES MAINTAIN AN *ADMIRABLE* PUBLIC OPTIMISM BUT IN PRIVATE MOMENTS ONE CAN DETECT A CREEPING DISMAY
49xc031a TO A PERSON THEY A- ATTRIBUTE THEIR SLIDE IN THE POLLS NOT TO ANY FAILURE IN THEIR MESSAGE BUT TO MR. BUSH'S LIES AND NEGATIVE CAMPAIGN
49xc031b <NOISE> ALL OF OUR STUFF SHOWS SAYS FIELD DIRECTOR CHARLIE BAKER THAT IF WE GET OUR MESSAGE OUT WE WIN
49xc031c MAYTAG IS THE LEADING LAUNDRY APPLIANCE COMPANY IN THE U. S. SAID CHARLES RYAN AN ANALYST WITH MERRILL LYNCH RESEARCH
49xc031d HOOVER IS THE LEADING LAUNDRY COMPANY OUTSIDE THE U. S.
49xc031e IT'S A GOOD FIT
49xc0401 PHIL WALTERS WHOSE BACK YARD WOULD HAVE FACED THE PROPOSED SHELTER SAYS HE WENT TO MEETINGS TO LEARN BOTH SIDES OF THE SHELTER DEBATE
49xc0402 BUT JUST FOR WANTING TO HEAR THE PROS AND CONS I BECAME A PRO DERELICT REVOLUTIONARY IN THE EYES OF SOME PEOPLE HE RECALLS
49xc0403 THEY DIDN'T WANT AN OBJECTIVE STUDY
49xc0404 THEY JUST WANTED TO PREVENT THE ONSLAUGHT OF THE BUMS
49xc0405 OCTOBER'S CONTRACTING FOR TRANSPORTATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONSTRUCTION S- SURGED THIRTY SEVEN PERCENT TO AN ANNUAL RATE OF FORTY FOUR POINT THREE NINE BILLION FOLLOWING A SHARP DECLINE IN SEPTEMBER
49xc0406 THE RALLY IN PUBLIC WORKS CONSTRUCTION DOMINATED THE MONTH'S ACTIVITY
49xc0407 MODEST GAINS IN HOME BUILDING WERE OFFSET BY A DECLINE IN *NONRESIDENTIAL* CONSTRUCTION
49xc0408 I WAS STARTLED STARTLED ISN'T THE WORD REACTED ALVIN NOVICK A BIOLOGY PROFESSOR AT YALE UNIVERSITY
49xc0409 HE WARNED THAT FORCED TESTING SUCH AS CONTEMPLATED BY THE CENTERS WOULD DRIVE HOMOSEXUALS UNDERGROUND AND AWAY FROM COOPERATION WITH PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAMS
49xc040a RATIONAL PEOPLE WON'T COOPERATE IN RUIN:ING THEIR OWN LIVES HE SAID
49xc040b LAST YEAR WAS THE WORST SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE IN THE RAW NUMBER OF DOWNGRADES AND THE SECOND WORST ON A PERCENTAGE BASIS
49xc040c SOME SEVENTY ONE PERCENT OF ALL CHANGES IN DEBT RATINGS WERE NEGATIVE LAST YEAR COMPARED WITH SEVENTY THREE PERCENT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO
49xc040d THE BEST YEAR OF THE PAST SIX WAS NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR IN WHICH FIFTY ONE PERCENT OF REPORTED CHANGES WERE DOWNGRADES
49xc040e THE NEW GOVERNMENT HAS STARTED TO LOWER PERSONAL INCOME TAXES AND AT THE SAME TIME IT HAS BEGUN TO BRING ITS OWN SPENDING UNDER CONTROL
49xc040f IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN BUDGET THE HIGHEST RATE OF INCOME TAX WAS LOWERED TO FIFTY EIGHT PERCENT FROM SIXTY FIVE PERCENT
49xc040g THIS IS PART OF A WORLD WIDE MOVEMENT THAT FRANCE MUST FOLLOW TO KEEP ITS MOST ENERGETIC AGGRESSIVE AND BRIGHT YOUNG PEOPLE AND TO *ATTRACT* INVESTORS-
49xc040h J. P.
49xc040i MORGAN HAS ALWAYS BEEN A HERO OF MINE MR. FARKAS SAYS
49xc040j OF COURSE HE QUICKLY ADDS I DON'T SEE MYSELF AS A ROBBER BARON IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM
49xc040k A MAN WHO DOES THIS THE CONGRESSMEN PROFESS TO BELIEVE CAN'T BE TRUSTED
49xc040l CERTAINLY HE CAN'T ASSOCIATE WITH THE BOY SCOUTS WHO INHABIT CAPITOL HILL HEARING ROOMS
49xc040m OFF WITH HIS HEAD
49xc040n MR. PETERS FIFTY FIVE YEARS OLD WAS FIRED LAST JANUARY IN A MANAGEMENT DISPUTE AFTER THIRTY YEARS WITH J. W. T.
49xc040o HE PLANNED TO START A COMPANY TO IMPORT HANDMADE GOODS FROM EUROPE
49xc040p HE ALSO LOOKED FORWARD TO EXPANDING THE TINY CHARTER AIRCRAFT CONCERN THAT HAD BEEN HIS HOBBY FOR YEARS
49xc040q THEN LAST FEBRUARY HE WAS CONTACTED BY MARTIN SORRELL CHAIRMAN OF W. P. P. THE BRITISH MARKETING SERVICES CONCERN
49xc040r WHAT REMAINS FOR HISTORY TO JUDGE IS FIRST HOW WELL HE SUCCEEDED
49xc040s HERE THE JUDGMENT MAY BE MIXED
49xc040t WE DO HAVE LESS TAXES AND LESS INFLATION BUT BIGGER SPENDING AND AS MUCH GOVERNMENT AS BEFORE
49xc040u HISTORY'S SECOND JUDGMENT WILL BE WHETHER HIS YEARS REPRESENT A MERE PASSING CHANGE OR WHETHER THE CHANGE WILL ENDURE
49xc040v WE CANNOT SAY TODAY BECAUSE WE CANNOT KNOW WHAT COMES HEREAFTER AND WHAT COMES HEREAFTER WILL DECIDE MR. REAGAN'S PLACE AMONG OUR PRESIDENTS
49xc040w WHEN THE MARKET WAS ROARING IT WAS STUPID TO HAVE CASH SAYS THE FUND MANAGER AT A MAJOR JAPANESE TRUST BANK
49xc040x BUT NOW IT ISN'T SO BAD
49xc040y AND SALOMON'S MR. NAPIER SAYS EVERYONE IS GETTING INTO CASH RIGHT NOW WAITING
49xc040z SIGNS OF CHANGE ARE EVERYWHERE
49xc0410 ALTHOUGH FEW FIRMS ADMIT TO *STAFF* CUTS MANY ARE QUIETLY PRUNING THEIR RANKS
49xc0411 MANY HAVE SHIFTED THEIR SPECIALISTS IN TAX EXEMPT HOUSING BONDS WHERE ACTIVITY IS PARTICULARLY LOW TO THEIR MORTGAGE BACKED BOND OPERATIONS
49xc0412 UNTIL NOW NASDAQ OR THE N. A. S. D.'S AUTOMATED QUOTATION SYSTEM HAS PROVIDED COMPUTER TERMINALS WITH PRICE QUOTATIONS ON ALL ISSUES
49xc0413 MOST BIG TRADES HOWEVER ARE NEGOTIATED BY TELEPHONE AND THEN RECORDED IN THE SYSTEM'S COMPUTERS
49xc0414 ONLY THE SMALL ORDER SYSTEM HAS PROVIDED TRADERS WITH THE ABILITY TO EXECUTE TRADES BY COMPUTER RATHER THAN BY TELEPHONE
49xc0415 AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED BLACK AND DECKER HAS COUNTERED AMERICAN STANDARD'S RIGHTS PLAN BY SEEKING SHAREHOLDERS' CONSENT TO TAKE CONTROL OF AMERICAN STANDARD'S BOARD
49xc0416 THE MANEUVER IS SIMILAR TO A PROXY FIGHT BUT DOESN'T REQUIRE A SHAREHOLDER MEETING
49xc0417 BLACK AND DECKER IS AWAITING SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION CLEARANCE TO BEGIN THE CONSENT SOLIC:ITATION
49xc0418 NO HE'S NOT
49xc0419 TOBACCO COMPANIES HAVE THE RIGHT TO MARKET THEIR PRODUCT HE SAYS HIS VOICE RISING AND HIS PARTY MANNERS WEARING THIN
49xc041a THEY OUGHT TO BE ACCORDED THE SAME FAIRNESS AS PEOPLE WHO SELL HOUSE PLANTS
49xc041b BUT THIS RELIANCE ALSO RAISES THE STAKES IN THE FARMERS RACE
49xc041c THE WHOLE GROUP STRATEGY GOES OUT THE DOOR IF B. A. T. LOSES FARMERS SAYS PAUL BURKE AN ANALYST AT LONDON STOCKBROKERS KLEINWORT GRIEVESON SECURITIES
49xc041d AND YOU'RE PERCEIVED AS A LOSER WHICH YOU DON'T WANT TO BE IN AMERICA
49yc0201 ALBERT HALPRIN CHIEF OF THE F. C. C.'S COMMON CARRIER BUREAU SAID HE HADN'T SEEN THE CONSUMER GROUP'S STUDY
49yc0202 HE SAID PREVIOUS STUDIES BY THE GROUP HAD FOCUSED ON FLAT RATE SERVICE FOR LOCAL CALLS
49yc0203 MR. HALPRIN CONCEDED THAT SUCH RATES HAD RISEN SHARPLY BUT HE ADDED THAT PHONE COMPANIES NOW OFFER A VARIETY OF LOCAL TELEPHONE PLANS AT DIFFERING PRICES
49yc0204 WHAT EVER GENCORP DOES IT'S GOT TO BE A MASTERPIECE A VAN GOGH
49yc0205 IF THEY DO THE WRONG THING THEY'LL END UP IN PLAY AGAIN SAYS RICHARD L. HAYDON MANAGING DIRECTOR OF BREAN MURRAY FOSTER SECURITIES
49yc0206 HE'D PREFER A DISTRIBUTION OF NINETY DOLLARS CASH PLUS TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS OF SUBORDINATED DEBT AS WELL AS SOME CONTINUING EQUITY FOR CURRENT HOLDERS
49yc0207 BEVERLY HAS A HISTORY OF CONTENTIOUS RELATIONS WITH UNIONS
49yc0208 BETWEEN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO AND NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR BEVERLY'S MANAGEMENT WAS THE TARGET OF SEVERAL UNSUCCESSFUL PROXY FIGHTS WAGED BY THE A. F. L. C. I. O.
49yc0209 <NOISE> NONE OF THE UNION PROPOSALS HOWEVER RECEIVED VOTES FROM MORE THAN FIVE PERCENT OF SHAREHOLDERS
49yc020a HEADING THE LIST IS HONGKONG BANK WHICH IS BUYING OUT THE MINORITY SHAREHOLDERS OF MARINE MIDLAND BANK ITS PRINCIPAL U. S. SUBSIDIARY FOR EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS
49yc020b JOHN GRAY A HONGKONG BANK EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CONFIRMED THAT THE BANK IS SHOPPING FOR A EUROPEAN ACQUISITION BUT MAINTAINS THAT NO SPECIFIC TARGET IS IN SIGHT YET
49yc020c EUROPE IS WHERE THE GAP IS IN OUR GLOBAL OPERATIONS HE SAID
49yc020d EVEN THE TRADITIONAL GREEN STAMP MIGHT BECOME A THING OF THE PAST
49yc020e IN RESPONSE TO CONSUMERS' COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE TASK OF PASTING IN TRADING STAMPS SPERRY AND HUTCHINSON COMPANY IS TESTING ELECTRONIC GREEN STAMPS IN SUPERMARKETS IN CONNECTICUT
49yc020f INSTEAD OF RECEIVING PAPER STAMPS CONSUMERS HAND THE CASHIER A PLASTIC CARD
49yc020g THE CARD IS INSERTED INTO A TERMINAL THAT AUTOMATICALLY RECORDS THE NUMBER OF STAMPS ACCRUED
49yc020h CLEARLY SOMETHING IS CHANGING IN EUROPE
49yc020i IT ISN'T THAT THE WALL IS ABOUT TO FALL ANY TIME SOON
49yc020j BUT THE SERIOUSNESS WITH WHICH SERIOUS EUROPEANS DISCUSS THE PROSPECT VIVIDLY UNDERSCORES THE IMPACT ON WESTERN EUROPE OF MR. GORBACHEV AND HIS REFORM POLICIES
49yc020k YOU DIDN'T HAVE PEOPLE HITTING THE SILKS ON THIS SAID JOHN KEEFE AN ANALYST FOR DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT INCORPORATED NEW YORK
49yc020l YOU HAD TO EXPECT HIGHER REDEMPTIONS GIVEN ALL THE DIFFICULTY IN THE MARKET
49yc020m BUT IT WAS CONTAINED FAIRLY WELL
49yc020n FOR TWO YEARS AFTER HIS NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE ELECTION HE PUT INTO EFFECT THE SOCIALIST PROGRAM OF FAST REFLATION AND WHOLESALE NATIONALIZATION
49yc020o AS INFLATION SOARED AND THE FRANC NOSE DIVED HIS APPROVAL RATING PLUNGED
49yc020p THEN HE CHANGED COURSE COMPLETELY
49yc020q HIS NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE AUSTERITY PROGRAM WAS APPLAUDED BY EVEN HIS RIGHT WING OPPONENTS
49yc020r AFTER NAMING FOUR COMMUNISTS TO HIS ORIGINAL CABINET HE BROKE WITH THE COMMUNISTS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR AND DESTROYED THEM AS A POLITICAL FORCE
49yc020s THE TOKYO FOREIGN STOCK EXCHANGE MARKET IS CLOSED ON SATURDAYS
49yc020t EUROPEAN STOCK MARKETS WERE CLOSED FRIDAY AND SATURDAY EXCEPT MILAN WHERE PRICES EDGED UP IN FRIDAY'S SESSION
49yc020u THE MILAN STOCK INDEX CLOSED UP SEVEN LIRE AT <NOISE> ONE THOUSAND SIXTY SIX
49yc020v WHO'S RIGHT
49yc020w IN SOME RESPECTS THEY ALL ARE BUT THE BLAME DOESN'T REST ON OSHA'S SHOULDERS ALONE
49yc020x THE AGENCY HAS COME UNDER FIRE FOR DOING TOO MUCH OR TOO LITTLE FROM THE DAY ITS DOORS OPENED ON CONSTITUTION AVENUE SEVENTEEN YEARS AGO
49yc020y THE REALITY IS THAT OSHA'S EFFECTIVENESS HAS BEEN PINCHED BY BUDGET AND STAFF CUTS AND ITS GRASP ON BUSINESS LOOSENED BY THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION'S DEREGULATORY SHOCK TROOPS
49yc020z SOUTH AFRICA ANGOLA AND CUBA ENDED A ROUND OF PEACE TALKS WITHOUT AN AGREEMENT OR A DATE TO MEET AGAIN
49yc0210 BUT SOURCES SAID THE DISCUSSIONS WHICH INVOLVE NAMIBIAN INDEPENDENCE AND PEACE IN ANGOLA HAVE MADE PROGRESS
49yc0211 APPARENTLY THE THREE NATIONS ARE FOCUSING ON A U. S. PROPOSAL THAT WOULD GET CUBAN TROOPS OUT OF ANGOLA IN TWO YEARS
49yc0212 MR. MINOLI THE U. S. GENERAL MANAGER SAYS BENETTON RECENTLY DROPPED ITS STRATEGY OF SATURATING THE MARKET WITH SMALL STORES
49yc0213 NOW IT IS CONCENTRATING ON PROFESSIONALISM AND THE SERVICING OF EXISTING STORES HE SAYS
49yc0214 NEW STORES WILL BE LARGER OUTLETS CALLED UNITED COLORS THAT WILL OFFER A MUCH BROADER RANGE OF MERCHANDISE
49yc0215 BENETTON PLANS TO HAVE TEN UNITED COLORS SHOPS OPERATING IN THE U. S. BY NEXT SPRING
49yc0216 MR. MINOLI ALSO ESTIMATES THAT AS MANY AS ONE HUNDRED SMALLER BENETTON STORES MAY CLOSE IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS
49yc0217 BUT IT'S WHAT THIS ELECTION IS ALL ABOUT
49yc0218 THE REAL QUESTION ON THE BALLOT IS SHOULD THE REAGAN YEARS CONTINUE BEYOND THE REAGAN YEARS
49yc0219 BEYOND THE BUSH YEARS
49yc021a BEYOND EVEN THE QUAYLE YEARS
49yc021b THE SUPREME COURT WILL DETERMINE THAT AND THE NEXT PRESIDENT WILL DETERMINE THE COURT'S MAKEUP FOR AT LEAST ANOTHER GENERATION
49yc021c COMPANIES LISTED BELOW REPORTED QUARTERLY PROFIT SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE AVERAGE OF ANALYSTS' ESTIMATES
49yc021d THE COMPANIES ARE FOLLOWED BY AT LEAST THREE ANALYSTS AND HAD A MINIMUM FIVE CENT CHANGE IN ACTUAL EARNINGS PER SHARE
49yc021e ESTIMATED AND ACTUAL RESULTS INVOLVING LOSSES ARE OMITTED
49yc0301 PAYOFFS TO MOSCOW BY THE WEST COULD RANGE FROM SOFTENING HUMAN RIGHTS POLICIES TO EXTENDING CHEAP LOANS TO RELAXING TECHNOLOGY CONTROLS
49yc0302 THE AVAILABLE SOVIET INSTRUMENTS INCLUDE ITS NORTH SEA NAVY ITS MOBILE ARMORED FORCES IN CENTRAL EUROPE AND ITS ARRAY OF CONVENTIONALLY ARMED TACTICAL MISSILES
49yc0303 WHETHER SUCH BLACKMAIL WOULD EVER BE SENSIBLE OR POSSIBLE IS ARGUABLE BUT OFFICIALS LIKE MR. ABSHIRE DON'T WANT MOSCOW TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO TRY
49yc0304 DEMOCRATS HAVE THE CREDIBILITY ON THE BUDGET ISSUE ASSERTS KIRK O'DONNELL PRESIDENT OF THE CENTER FOR NATIONAL POLICY A DEMOCRATIC THINK TANK
49yc0305 NOW THEY HAVE TO MAKE THE RECORD
49yc0306 FAILURE TO COME THROUGH WITH A DEFICIT CUTTING PLAN HE ADDS WOULD MEAN AN OPPORTUNITY LOST
49yc0307 FUJITSU LIMITED'S THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF FIVE YEAR EUROBONDS WITH THE SAME BASIC TERMS CLOSED AT NINETY EIGHT TO NINETY NINE
49yc0308 THE JAPANESE ELECTRONICS CONCERN IS AFFECTED BY THE U. S.'S NEWLY IMPOSED DUTIES ON CERTAIN PRODUCTS ACCORDING TO AN OFFICIAL AT NIKKO SECURITIES COMPANY WHICH LED THE ISSUE
49yc0309 BUT IT ISN'T CLEAR HOW LARGE THE IMPACT WILL BE
49yc030a MOST OF THE LOAN WOULD BE USED TO REIMBURSE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE IMPORTERS FOR GOODS THEY WOULD IMPORT AND THEN INCORPORATE INTO PRODUCTS THAT COULD BE EXPORTED
49yc030b THE LOAN WOULD BE FOR FIFTEEN YEARS INCLUDING THREE YEARS OF GRACE AND CARRY A VARIABLE INTEREST RATE TIED TO THE BANK'S BORROWING COSTS
49yc030c THE RATE CURRENTLY STANDS AT SEVEN POINT NINE TWO PERCENT
49yc030d OBVIOUSLY I HAVE TO TELL MY PEOPLE DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH HARM YOU'RE DOING TO YOURSELF BY MAKING PRODUCTS OF INSUFFICIENT QUALITY
49yc030e MR. LEVY SAYS
49yc030f YOU HAVE TO TELL THE TRUTH
49yc030g THEN A YOUNG MAN APPEARS IN THE DOORWAY
49yc030h NO DELIVERY TODAY HE SAYS
49yc030i I TALKED TO THE MANAGER
49yc030j THE WOMEN SHRUG AND GO HOME
49yc030k ANOTHER BAROMETER OF THE ECONOMY'S FUTURE COURSE CALLED THE LONG LEADING COMPOSITE IS COMPILED BY COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY'S CENTER FOR INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS CYCLE RESEARCH
49yc030l THE COLUMBIA COMPOSITE HAS SIGNALED RECESSIONS ON THE AVERAGE BY FOURTEEN MONTHS <NOISE> A SOMEWHAT LONGER LEAD TIME THAN FOR THE COMMERCE INDEX
49yc030m IT IS NO SURPRISE ACCORDINGLY THAT THE COLUMBIA COMPOSITE REACHED A PEAK BEFORE THE COMMERCE INDEX IN JULY
49yc030n SINCE THEN THE COMPOSITE HAS FALLEN WITH LITTLE INTERRUPTION
49yc030o HOWEVER NET LOSSES IN EURODOLLAR BOND PRICES WERE ESTIMATED AT ONLY ONE EIGHTH TO THREE EIGHTHS POINT BY TRADERS
49yc030p THE BENCHMARK CANADIAN NINE PERCENT BONDS DUE IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX WERE BID THIRTY BASIS POINTS LOWER
49yc030q THE EURODOLLAR BOND MARKET STILL HAS A LOT OF UNDERLYING STRENGTH SAID A SENIOR TRADER FOR ONE EUROPEAN BANK
49yc030r FINE ANSWERED HIS FRIEND JOHN REILLY
49yc030s WHO CAN YOU TELL
49yc030t CERTAINLY NOT THE PUBLIC MR. REILLY NOW SAYS WITH A CHUCKLE
49yc030u GOD YOU DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO THINK A FORMER VICE PRESIDENT DIDN'T KNOW
49yc030v C. P. I. IS A CLOSELY OWNED REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST WITH ABOUT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN ASSETS
49yc030w ITS SHAREHOLDERS INCLUDE SOME OF THE NATION'S LARGEST PENSION FUNDS
49yc030x C. P. I. ISN'T INVOLVED IN THE LITIGATION BUT SOME OF ITS SHAREHOLDERS WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY LOVE TO SLOW DOWN THE ACTIVITY IN LEVERAGED TAKEOVERS
49yc030y THE U. S. BOND MARKET MEANWHILE CONTINUES TO STRUGGLE WITH TWO PERSISTENT PROBLEMS
49yc030z THE U. S. TRADE DEFICIT CREATES PRESSURE FOR A LOWER DOLLAR
49yc0310 THE THREAT OF RISING INFLATION BECOMES GREATER AS THE DOLLAR WEAKENS AND AS CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE LATE STAGE OF AN ECONOMIC BOOM PUSH UP WAGES AND PRICES
49yc0311 BUT SOME ARGUE AGENDA COULD BE A BIG HIT AND CREATE A NEW CATEGORY OF SOFTWARE
49yc0312 THIS IS FUNDAMENTALLY NEW AND DIFFERENT
49yc0313 IT'S TREMENDOUSLY EXCITING SAYS ESTHER DYSON EDITOR OF RELEASE ONE POINT OH A NEWSLETTER THAT COVERS COMPUTER SOFTWARE
49yc0314 I THINK IT'S AN EXTREMELY USEFUL TOOL SAYS MORT ROSENTHAL CHAIRMAN OF CORPORATE SOFTWARE INCORPORATED A WESTWOOD MASSACHUSETTS BASED SOFTWARE DISTRIBUTOR
49yc0315 HE SAYS HE USES AGENDA MORE THAN ANY OTHER SOFTWARE
49yc0316 ESTIMATES OF THE MAKEUP OF THE FEEDLOT POPULATION VARY WIDELY
49yc0317 MOST ANALYSTS EXPECT THE GOVERNMENT TO REPORT THAT THE NUMBER OF YOUNG CATTLE PLACED ON FEEDLOTS FELL IN JULY FOR THE SECOND CONSECUTIVE MONTH FROM A YEAR EARLIER
49yc0318 HOWEVER SOME EXPECT A RISE
49yc0319 A SIMPLER WAY TO REDUCE BANK DEBTS THAT IS MORE ADVANTAGEOUS TO BORROWERS ARE STRAIGHT BUY BACKS IN THE GROWING SECONDARY LOAN MARKET
49yc031a BUY BACKS HELPED CLEAR UP LATIN AMERICAN DEBT PROBLEMS IN THE LATE NINETEEN THIRTIES
49yc031b IN MARCH BOLIVIA BOUGHT BACK JUST UNDER HALF ITS SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY MILLION DOLLAR BANK DEBT AT ELEVEN CENTS FOR EACH DOLLAR OF DEBT
49yc031c NOW HIS LAUGHTER IS GONE
49yc031d BECAUSE OF DRUGS HE IS DEAD
49yc031e AND EVERY DAY MY HEART BREAKS A LITTLE MORE
49yc0401 CLARK SAID FRIDAY IT WAS INFORMED BY BARRIS THAT IT OWNED ABOUT TWO POINT EIGHT PERCENT OF CLARK'S STOCK AND INTENDED TO ACQUIRE A LARGER STAKE
49yc0402 GIANT ALSO SAID LAST WEEK THAT IT HELD CLARK SHARES BUT IT DIDN'T DISCLOSE HOW MANY
49yc0403 GIANT AND CLARK SAID THEY EACH MAY EVENTUALLY ACQUIRE FIFTEEN PERCENT OR MORE OF CLARK'S SHARES
49yc0404 WHAT I AM SUGGESTING GENTLEMEN IS THAT THE PROCESS HAS NOT WORKED
49yc0405 IT HAS BEEN INDISCREET ON BOTH ENDS OF PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE
49yc0406 IF I HAD DIVULGED WHAT I WAS DOING MANY MANY LIVES WERE AT STAKE
49yc0407 THE OPPOSITION IS ALREADY ROLLING
49yc0408 MANY OF THE PRESSURE GROUPS THAT CAMPAIGNED UNSUCCESSFULLY AGAINST MR. REAGAN IN TWO PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS SEEM TO REGARD THIS BATTLE AS THEIR ARMAGEDDON
49yc0409 TEDDY KENNEDY HIMSELF HAS TESTIFIED THAT JUDGE BORK'S APPEARANCE MEANS THE END IS NEAR
49yc040a IF RONALD REAGAN WANTS ROBERT BORK CONFIRMED HE WILL HAVE TO CREATE AN ALTERNATIVE CHOICE TO THE ONE <NOISE> THESE GROUPS ARE TRYING TO FORCE ON UNDECIDED SENATORS
49yc040b THAT MEANS MR. REAGAN HAS TO EXPLAIN CLEARLY WHY AMERICAN SOCIETY WILL BENEFIT IF JUDGES SUCH AS ROBERT BORK APPLY THE LAW IN A NEUTRAL MANNER
49yc040c HE WILL HAVE TO POINT OUT WHY MANY OF THE LONG HELD GRIEVANCES OF THE ELECTORATE RESULT WHEN UN- WHEN UNELECTED JUDGES MANUFACTURE NEW LAWS
49yc040d CERTAINLY FOREIGN COMPETITION AND A CHANGING WORLD ECONOMY HAVE EXACTED A HEAVY TOLL ON OUR NATION'S MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES
49yc040e HOWEVER MANY OF THESE INDUSTRIES HAVE SURVIVED AND ARE NOW AS TOUGH AND LEAN AS THEY'VE EVER BEEN
49yc040f THE MANAGERS OF THESE COMPANIES HAVE LEARNED THROUGH HARD EXPERIENCE ABOUT EXACTLY WHICH INVESTMENTS PAY OFF
49yc040g INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH SOME DEMOCRATS ARE WARMING TO THE IDEA
49yc040h PRIVATIZATION OFTEN IS SIMPLY GOOD MANAGEMENT SENSE
49yc040i IT NO LONGER REPRESENTS JUST AN IDEOLOGICAL ARGUMENT SAYS DAVID LINOWES A DEMOCRAT WHO CHAIRS PRESIDENT REAGAN'S COMMISSION ON PRIVATIZATION <NOISE> WHICH ISSUES ITS REPORT NEXT MONTH
49yc040j ADDS DEMOCRATIC REPRESENTATIVE DENNIS ECKART OF OHIO WE OUGHT TO LOOK AT ALTERNATIVES AND BETTER WAYS TO PROVIDE SERVICES
49yc040k THE BASIC DEMOCRATIC RESPONSE UNTIL NOW HAS BEEN DROP DEAD BUT I THINK THAT'S A MISTAKE
49yc040l SOME DEMOCRATS BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT MAY GET SOME OF HIS PRIVATIZATION INITIATIVES ENACTED BEFORE HE LEAVES OFFICE
49yc040m ARE THEY SUPPOSED TO REMAIN POOR BECAUSE YOU WANT TO STUDY TROPICAL ANIMALS
49yc040n IS YOUR STUDY MORE IMPORTANT THAN FILLING THE EMPTY STOMACHS OF POOR PEOPLE
49yc040o ARE MALAYSIANS EXPECTED TO LOSE MILLIONS OF POUNDS SO THAT YOU CAN STUDY ANIMALS
49yc040p A LORIMAR SPOKESMAN CONFIRMED YESTERDAY THAT MR. ADELSON AGREED TO BUY ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY NINE THOUSAND SHARES <NOISE> OF LORIMAR STOCK FROM MR. GARIN
49yc040q THE SPOKESMAN SAID THE TRANSACTION BETWEEN MESSRS.
49yc040r ADELSON AND GARIN WAS ARRANGED BEFORE DISCUSSIONS RESUMED WITH WARNER
49yc040s THE G. O. P. SEEMS PRIMED IN OTHER WORDS FOR A REPLAY OF OLD VALUES THEMES
49yc040t BUT A PARADOX ARISES
49yc040u MR. BUSH NEVER WAS STRONGLY IDENTIFIED WITH THE SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE WING OF THE PARTY
49yc040v MR. REAGAN HIMSELF WHEN HE GOT I- IN OFFICE PUT ITS ISSUES ON THE BACK BURNER
49yc040w CONISTON AMONG OTHER THINGS IS CALLING FOR A NEW VOTE

49yc0412 THE COURT CANNOT UNDO HIS BAD BARGAIN THE COURT RULED
49yc0413 UNITED ALSO DISPUTED CONTINEN:TAL'S ASSERTION THAT IT WOULD OFFER LOWER FARES
49yc0414 A SPOKESMAN SAID UNITED HAS TRIED SEVERAL TIMES TO REDUCE FARES TO JAPAN BUT HAS BEEN OPPOSED BY THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT WHICH FEARED INCREASED COMPETITION FOR ITS NATIONAL CARRIERS
49yc0415 FARES BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES CAN BE CHANGED ONLY THROUGH BILATERAL AGREEMENT
49yc0416 THE BOND ISSUANCE PROVISION IS PART OF A CONTROVERSIAL TAX BILL
49yc0417 AS OF LATE YESTERDAY THAT BILL APPEARED STALLED ANALYSTS SAID
49yc0418 IF CONGRESS DOESN'T ACT SOON THE TREASURY WON'T BE ABLE TO ISSUE NEW LONG TERM BONDS UNTIL EARLY NEXT YEAR
49yc0419 THE DISCOUNT DEPARTMENT STORE OPERATOR SAID THE CHARGE WILL REFLECT A WRITE DOWN OF FIXED ASSETS <NOISE> INVENTORY DISPOSAL AND SEVERANCE PAY IN RELATION TO THE STORE CLOSING
49yc041a THE STORE WHICH HAS ABOUT FORTY EMPLOYEES WILL CLOSE IN EARLY JANUARY

49zc0201 IN THE PAST FILIPINOS IN MANY RURAL AREAS PREFERRED THE DISCIPLINED TERROR OF THE N. P. A. TO THE RANDOM EXCESSES OF THE COUNTRY'S MILITARY
49zc0202 WITH THE CHANGE OF GOVERNMENT LAST YEAR A MILD IMPROVEMENT IN MILITARY BEHAVIOR AND THE DETECTION OF THE MINDANAO SLAUGHTERS SOME FILIPINOS ARE CHANGING THEIR MINDS
49zc0203 DIPLOMATS AND POLITICAL ANALYSTS SAY THEY DON'T KNOW IF THE TREND PRESAGES SIGNIFICANT POPULAR RESISTANCE TO THE COMMUNISTS OR JUST ADDITIONAL TURMOIL IN THE PHILIPPINE COUNTRYSIDE
49zc0204 HE HAD A POINT

4a0c0402 BUT THE DOLLAR'S TWENTY PERCENT DECLINE AGAINST THE FRENCH FRANC SINCE DECEMBER NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE COULD HAVE INFLATED THE COMPANY'S EFFECTIVE PRODUCTION COSTS BY ABOUT THE SAME PERCENTAGE
4a0c0403 CATERPILLAR SAYS IT HEDGED AGAINST RISK FROM FOREIGN EXCHANGE FLUCTUATIONS ON THE INTERBANK MARKET HELPING TO EASE THE FALLING DOLLAR'S NEGATIVE IMPACT
4a0c0404 MOST INDIANS TRAVELING TO PAKISTAN MUST DO LIKEWISE
4a0c0405 VISAS FOR EITHER COUNTRY TAKE ABOUT A MONTH TO OBTAIN
4a0c0406 INDIANS TRAVELING IN PAKISTAN AND *PAKISTANIS* VISITING INDIA MUST SPELL OUT WELL IN ADVANCE WHICH CITIES THEY PLAN TO VISIT AND REGISTER WITH THE POLICE AT EVERY STOP
4a0c0407 THEY RISK DETENTION IF THEY DEVIATE FROM THE ITINERARY
4a0c0408 <NOISE> THE SYSTEM ISN'T ONE HUNDRED PERCENT PERFECT BUT IT'S WORKING REASONABLY WELL A FOREIGN MINISTRY OFFICIAL TOLD REPORTERS
4a0c0409 THE OFFICIAL SAID THE U. S. HAS BEEN *SIMILARLY* REASSURED
4a0c040a EVEN SO THE U. S. HAS INDICATED THAT IT WANTS JAPAN TO TAKE BETTER CARE OF HOW JAPANESE TECHNOLOGY IS SOLD AROUND THE WORLD
4a0c040b SHARON'S BOARD FOUGHT THE ACQUISITION VIGOROUSLY TO NO AVAIL
4a0c040c EVENTUALLY SHARON SHAREHOLDERS TENDERED EIGHTY SIX PERCENT OF THEIR SHARES GIVING N. V. F. CONTROL
4a0c040d AT THE FIRST BOARD MEETING UNDER MR. POSNER SIX DIRECTORS RESIGNED
4a0c040e AN EMBITTERED MR. PERRAULT LEFT THREE MONTHS LATER
4a0c040f UNDER BANKRUPTCY LAW TEXACO ALONE CURRENTLY HAS THE RIGHT TO PROPOSE A REORGANIZATION PLAN FOR ITSELF
4a0c040g THAT RIGHT EXPIRES NEXT MONTH BUT TEXACO HAS ASKED JUDGE SCHWARTZBERG TO BLOCK PROPOSALS FROM ANY OTHER PARTIES UNTIL MARCH NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT
4a0c040h THE PENNZOIL SPOKESMAN SAID THE REORGANIZATION PLAN TO BE OUTLINED TODAY WOULD BE PRESENTED AS PART OF A MOTION OPPOSING TEXACO'S REQUEST FOR MORE TIME
4a0c040i BUT WESTIN HAS SHOWN UNSPECTACULAR ALBEIT STEADY EARNINGS IN RECENT YEARS AS COMPETITION HAS HEATED UP IN THE LUXURY HOTEL MARKET
4a0c040j IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX IT HAD OPERATING EARNINGS OF FIFTY FIVE MILLION ABOUT FOUR MILLION LESS THAN IT EARNED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO
4a0c040k REVENUE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX WAS FOUR HUNDRED NINETY ONE POINT SIX MILLION
4a0c040l WITH A REBOUND IN THE STOCK MARKET INVESTORS' FEARS ABOUT A RECESSION COOLED AND THE BOND MARKET SLUMPED
4a0c040m A SHARP SLIDE IN THE U. S. DOLLAR ALSO ADDED SOME DOWNWARD PRESSURE TO BOND PRICES
4a0c040n DESPITE THE DECLINE IN BONDS THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM STILL CONTINUED TO MAKE GOOD ON ITS PROMISE TO PROVIDE AMPLE LIQUIDITY THROUGH ITS OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS
4a0c040o I REGARD THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AUTO RACING AND BOXING AS ONE OF DEGREE NOT KIND WITH AUTO RACING GETTING THE WORST OF THE COMPARISON
4a0c040p IN ADDITION I FAIL TO SEE AUTO RACING IN THE MAN AGAINST MAN DRAMA THAT SPORTS SHOULD GENERATE
4a0c040q <NOISE> TOO MUCH METAL AND TOO MANY CORPORATE STICKERS GET IN THE WAY
4a0c040r AS A RECENT VISIT REVEALED THE SOUP KITCHEN HAS BECOME A POWERFUL MAGNET DRAWING HUNDREDS WHO COME FOR MORE THAN JUST DAILY NOURISHMENT
4a0c040s MR. KOVACS AN OCTOGENARIAN WHO CROONS LOVE BALLADS TO ANYONE WHO WILL LISTEN COMES FOR CAMARADERIE
4a0c040t FOR GEORGE A MIDDLE AGED RETARDED MAN THE KITCHEN IS A LIFELINE
4a0c040u HE ARRIVED FIVE YEARS AGO PICKED UP A BROOM AND WITHOUT SAYING A WORD STARTED CLEANING UP HE NOW GETS PAID THE MINIMUM WAGE
4a0c040v BUT SEARS WASN'T ABLE TO PERSUADE MAYTAG CORPORATION AN APPLIANCE MAKER WITH A REPUTATION FOR QUALITY AND DEPENDABILITY TO START DISTRIBUTING MAYTAG PRODUCTS THROUGH SEARS STORES
4a0c040w SEARS OFFICIALS SAID TALKS ARE CONTINUING WITH NEWTON IOWA BASED MAYTAG WHICH HAS AN ESTIMATED TWELVE PERCENT SHARE OF THE U. S. APPLIANCE MARKET
4a0c040x OUR HOPE IS THAT THEY WILL SEE THE LIGHT SAID ERIC SAUNDERS A SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT FOR ADMINISTRATION AND PLANNING AT SEARS
4a0c040y SINCE MONDAY'S OPENING BELL N. C. N. B. SHARES HAVE JUMPED TO FOUR AND THREE EIGHTHS POINTS CLOSING AT TWENTY SEVEN SEVEN EIGHTHS YESTERDAY
4a0c040z MANY ANALYSTS PREDICT THE STOCK COULD GO HIGHER SOON PERHAPS CROSSING THE THIRTY DOLLAR A SHARE BARRIER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A YEAR
4a0c0410 LONG TERM BULLS PREDICT N. C. N. B.'S PRICE COULD EASILY DOUBLE AND SOME SAY TRIPLE
4a0c0411 MR. SMILOW SAID THAT THE COMPANY WON'T HAVE TO SELL ADDITIONAL ASSETS TO FINANCE A NEW BUY OUT
4a0c0412 BUT IT WILL HAVE A LOT MORE DEBT THAN IT HAD PREVIOUSLY
4a0c0413 AFTER THE BUY OUT IS COMPLETED HE SAID PLAYTEX APPAREL WILL HAVE TOTAL DEBT OF ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION
4a0c0414 *PLAYTEX* HOLDINGS' DEBT WILL APPROACH ONE BILLION DOLLARS
4a0c0415 OVERALL CONSUMER SPENDING HAS SLOWED SINCE LAST YEAR'S STOCK MARKET CRASH BUT IT'S STILL AT A LEVEL THAT WORRIES SOME ECONOMISTS
4a0c0416 CONSUMER CREDIT SLOWED SHARPLY IN JULY REFLECTING SLUGGISH SALES
4a0c0417 TOO MUCH SPENDING AT HOME COUPLED WITH HEAVY DEMAND FOR EXPORTS COULD OVERLOAD AN INDUSTRIAL SECTOR THAT IS ALREADY RUNNING NEAR CAPACITY
4a0c0418 TO BE SURE ON A LOT OF SCORES THE SUMMIT WAS A SUCCESS
4a0c0419 ECONOMIC COOPERATION WAS ADVANCED WITH BUSINESSMEN SIGNING AGREEMENTS FOR ABOUT THIRTY CONTRACTS AND SEVERAL JOINT VENTURES
4a0c041a HUMAN RIGHTS TOO MAY HAVE TAKEN A STEP FORWARD IF MR. GORBACHEV LIVES UP TO HIS PROMISE TO RELEASE ALL POLITICAL PRISONERS BY YEAR'S END
4a0c041b SOME BANKING ANALYSTS DOUBT A LONDON OR TOKYO BANK WOULD MAKE A SIMILAR ACQUISITION ANYTIME HERE SOON
4a0c041c AMONG OTHER THINGS SOME FOREIGN BANKS HAVE BEEN SHYING AWAY FROM ACQUIRING ASSETS IN THE U. S. BECAUSE OF UNEXPECTEDLY HIGH EXPENSES MANAGING THEM FROM AFAR
4a0c041d INSTEAD THE TREND AMONG FOREIGN BANKS IS TO INCREASINGLY BUILD ALLIANCES WITH U. S. BANKS
4a1c0201 THE IRANIAN CRISIS AND THE ADMINISTRATION'S UNCERTAIN GRIP ON IT HAS REAWAKENED THIS CYNICISM
4a1c0202 THE POLLS SHOW MUCH OF THE PUBLIC DOES NOT BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT WHEN HE DENIES KNOWING THAT PROFITS FROM IRANIAN ARMS SALES HAVE BEEN USED TO AID THE CONTRAS
4a1c0203 <NOISE> ON THIS THE MATTER IS LIKELY TO TURN
4a1c0204 NOT ON WHETHER THE SHIPMENTS WERE A GOOD IDEA OR ON WHETHER LAWYERS CAN FIND SOME LAW THAT HAS BEEN BROKEN
4a1c0205 BUT ON WHETHER PRESIDENT REAGAN TOLD THE TRUTH WHEN HE DENIED KNOWING
4a1c0206 THE COMPUTER ALSO CAN DISPLAY A PATTERN SHOWING HOW PEOPLE NORMALLY PLACE THE TONGUE TO PRODUCE SAY AN S. SOUND
4a1c0207 A DEAF PERSON CAN THEN TRY TO MATCH THE PATTERN BY PLACING THE TONGUE AGAINST THE ELECTRONIC PALATE
4a1c0208 WITH CAREFUL COACHING AND TRIAL AND ERROR CHILDREN LIKE MISS GILROY CAN LEARN HOW TO MAKE SOUNDS THAT REQUIRE PLACING THE TONGUE AGAINST THE ROOF OF THE MOUTH
4a1c0209 MR. CASH OF HARVARD ADDS THERE IS A SHORTSIGHTEDNESS ON THE PART OF THE SUPPLIERS
4a1c020a BY REDUCING THE IMPORTANCE OF PERSONAL CONTACTS AND ESTABLISHING STANDARDS FOR COMMUNICATIONS COMPUTERS GIVE THE BUYER AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHOW ACROSS A BROADER LINE OF SUPPLIERS
4a1c020b HE SEES THE DAY WHEN AUTO MAKERS' COMPUTERS WILL SCAN THE COMPUTERS OF THEIR PRIMARY SUPPLIERS AND AUTOMATICALLY PLACE ORDERS WITH THE ONE OFFERING THE LOWEST PRICE
4a1c020c VISITS TO BOTH COUNTRIES HOWEVER LEAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE STRUGGLE WILL BE LONG
4a1c020d FOR DEBT IN BRAZIL AS IN MEXICO IS ONLY ONE SIDE OF THE EQUATION
4a1c020e THE OTHER IS FINDING THE RESOURCES AND THE WILL TO OVERCOME A MIRE OF POVERTY AND IGNORANCE
4a1c020f AND IN BOTH COUNTRIES THIS MIRE COULD ULTIMATELY PROVE POLITICALLY EXPLOSIVE
4a1c020g THE POLITICAL REASONS FOR CHAIRMAN KENNEDY'S SINGLE MINDEDNESS ARE CLEAR ENOUGH
4a1c020h ORGANIZED LABOR A MAJOR DEMOCRATIC CONSTITUENCY HAS FALLEN ON HARD TIMES AS REFLECTED IN A DECLINE IN THE UNIONIZED SHARE OF THE U. S. WORK FORCE
4a1c020i DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS WANT TO USE POLITICAL MUSCLE TO GIVE LABOR THINGS IT NOW HAS DIFFICULTY WINNING AT THE BARGAINING TABLE
4a1c020j CONGRESS GETS CREDIT FOR DOING SOMETHING NICE FOR LABOR AND EMPLOYERS FOOT THE BILL
4a1c020k SELLING THE CANADIAN BUSINESS WILL HELP T. L. C. GROUP COMPLETE ITS FINANCING ON THE REST OF BEATRICE INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS
4a1c020l <NOISE> T. L. C. GROUP SAID YESTERDAY THAT IT HAS A FIRM COMMITMENT FROM DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT INCORPORATED ITS INVESTMENT BANKER TO FINANCE ITS ACQUISITION
4a1c020m A DREXEL SPOKESMAN SAID HE EXPECTS THE FINANCING TO COME THROUGH A COMBINATION OF BANK LOANS AND HIGH YIELD BONDS
4a1c020n DREXEL FINANCED THE KOHLBERG KRAVIS BUY OUT OF BEATRICE LAST YEAR
4a1c020o THE LEGISLATION PUTS SWISS INSIDER LAWS MORE IN LINE WITH THOSE OF OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES
4a1c020p SWITZERLAND CURRENTLY ALLOWS THE INSIDER TO BE FREE BUT CAN PUNISH THOSE WHO PROFIT FROM A TIP
4a1c020q MEANWHILE AN INFORMAL PACT BETWEEN THE U. S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION AND THE SWISS BANKERS ASSOCIATION CONCERNING INSIDER TRADING INVESTIGATIONS HAS EXISTED SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO
4a1c020r THE PACT REQUIRES A CUSTOMER OF SWISS BANKS TO WAIVE SECRECY RIGHTS IF THE CUSTOMER IS LINKED TO AN INSIDER TRADING CASE BY THE S. E. C.
4a1c020s ROBERT H. SEWELL CHAIRMAN OF EQUITABLE BANKSHARES INCORPORATED A SMALL DALLAS BASED BANK HOLDING COMPANY WAS ASTONISHED AT THE OPULENCE
4a1c020t I DON'T LOOK AT IT AS BANK FURNITURE HE SAYS
4a1c020u BANKERS DON'T HAVE THIS KIND OF STUFF
4a1c020v NEVERTHELESS HE ARRIVED WITH A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN CASHIER'S CHECKS ENOUGH HE FIGURES TO OUTFIT HALF OF TWO NEW BRANCHES
4a1c020w USUALLY HE CALCULATES HE WOULD SPEND THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS TO BUY THAT MUCH FURNITURE AND EQUIPMENT
4a1c020x HE ALSO WAS IN THE MARKET FOR AUTOMATED TELLER MACHINES AND OTHER BANKING EQUIPMENT
4a1c020y SOME ISSUERS ALSO ARE WARY OF DOING AWAY WITH OUTSIDE COUNSEL
4a1c020z IN WASHINGTON STATE A PROPOSAL TO USE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AS COUNSEL ON ALL STATE BOND ISSUES CAME BEFORE A LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE LAST YEAR
4a1c0210 ITS ADOPTION WOULD HAVE SAVED WASHINGTON MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR
4a1c0211 STRONG OPPOSITION FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE DEFEATED THE PROPOSAL HOWEVER
4a1c0212 THERE ARE NUMEROUS OTHER PROVISIONS IN THE TRADE BILL THAT AMERICA'S PARTNERS FIND NO LESS DISCONCERTING
4a1c0213 COMPANIES THAT VIOLATE EXPORT CONTROLS FOR INSTANCE COULD BE BARRED FROM THE U. S. MARKET AND GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS FOR FIVE YEARS
4a1c0214 ALSO PROBLEMATIC IN MY VIEW IS THAT THE U. S. WOULD CALL FOREIGN COMPANIES TO ACCOUNT FOR VIOLATIONS OF FOREIGN LAW COMMITTED ABROAD
4a1c0215 RESTRICTING THE PRESIDENT'S SCOPE FOR ACTION REGARDING IMPORTS ALSO COULD TEND TO HARDEN INTERNATIONAL FRONTS
4a1c0216 EACH DECADE SINCE THE NINETEEN SIXTIES HAS SPAWNED A WELFARE REFORM MOVEMENT
4a1c0217 THE FIRST OF THESE IN THE FORM OF LYNDON JOHNSON'S GREAT SOCIETY LED TO A MASSIVE GROWTH OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S ROLE
4a1c0218 THE SECOND TRIED TO AMEND THE INCENTIVES OF THE SYSTEM TO ENCOURAGE WORK AND FAMILY STABILITY AND TO PROVIDE A MINIMUM INCOME FOR FAMILIES
4a1c0219 THE REFORM MOVEMENT OF THE EIGHTIES COMBINES TOUGHER APPROACHES TO WORK REQUIREMENTS AND FAMILY SUPPORT WITH MORE GENEROUS AID FOR TRAINING
4a1c021a YET THE WELFARE BILL THAT THE PRESIDENT WILL SIGN INTO LAW TOMORROW CONSTITUTES ONLY A MARGINAL CHANGE IN THE SYSTEM
4a1c021b MEANWHILE POVERTY CONTINUES WELFARE DEPENDENCY INCREASES AND THE UNDERCLASS EXPANDS
4a1c021c HIS BEST PITCH IS HIS SINKER AND IT'S A GREAT ONE
4a1c021d BUT HE'S GOT TO PINPOINT IT TO MAKE IT EFFECTIVE AND THAT'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO DO INNING AFTER INNING AND GAME AFTER GAME SAID DEMPSEY
4a1c021e HE WAS ABLE TO STAY IN A GROOVE LONGER THAN ANY PITCHER I'VE SEEN
4a1c021f IT'S STUDY ATTITUDE AND CONCENTRATION AND WHO KNOWS WHAT ELSE
4a1c021g <NOISE> ALL I KNOW IS THAT WHEREVER I PUT MY GLOVE TONIGHT THURSDAY IT'S MOSTLY WHERE THE BALL WENT
4a1c0301 <NOISE> THAT HARDLY MATTERS SAID SIR GEOFFREY NOTING THAT WITH ALL THE TRAITOR SPIES THAT PRECEDED HIM THERE WASN'T MUCH LEFT TO TELL
4a1c0302 THE POINT IS HE WAS ONE OF US
4a1c0303 HE JOINED M. FIFTEEN STRAIGHT OUT OF OXFORD
4a1c0304 BEEN IN THE CIVIL SERVICE ALL HIS LIFE
4a1c0305 HE HAS A HUGE SENSE OF HUMOR AND IS BY ALL ACCOUNTS A NICE MAN
4a1c0306 CRITICS SAY HE IS CAPTIVATED BY HIS OWN ELOQUENCE
4a1c0307 -TRUE HE SAYS SOMETIMES I DON'T KNOW WHEN TO SHUT UP
4a1c0308 REGARDLESS OF WHAT POLITICAL LABEL THEY THINK IS APPROPRIATE ALMOST EVERYONE REGARDS GEORGE BUSH AS A DECENT HONEST AND LIKABLE PERSON
4a1c0309 AND MOST WOULD AGREE THAT HIS PERSONAL HISTORY HAS A STORYBOOK QUALITY ABOUT IT
4a1c030a SOMEBODY ONCE SAID GEORGE BUSH HAS LED THE LIFE THAT RONALD REAGAN PORTRAYS SAYS PETE TEELEY A LONGTIME AIDE
4a1c030b DREXEL'S MR. JOSEPH CALLS *STALEY'S* ALLEGATIONS OUTRAGEOUS
4a1c030c HE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT SOME OF THE STATEMENTS ATTRIBUTED TO MR. DAHL WERE MADE BUT SAYS THAT OTHERS WEREN'T
4a1c030d HE SAYS THAT HE DOESN'T BELIEVE DREXEL CUSTOMERS' HOLDINGS IN STALEY WERE EVER LARGE ENOUGH TO REQUIRE A THIRTEEN D. FILING
4a1c030e THE DEBARTOLOS BASED ON THEIR PREVIOUS TAKEOVER ATTEMPTS HAVE THE FINANCIAL WHEREWITHAL TO MAKE A BID FOR ZAYRE
4a1c030f THE FAMILY'S PERSONAL WEALTH IS ESTIMATED AT SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AND THEY ARRANGED FINANCING FOR THE MULTIBILLION DOLLAR BIDS FOR ALLIED AND CARTER HAWLEY
4a1c030g THE DEBARTOLOS LOST OUT IN THE BIDDING FOR ALLIED TO CAMPEAU CORPORATION A TORONTO REAL ESTATE FIRM
4a1c030h CARTER HAWLEY AVOIDED A TAKEOVER THROUGH A RESTRUCTURING
4a1c030i KENYA SAID DOZENS OF UGANDAN SOLDIERS ENTERED ITS TERRITORY AND CLASHED WITH POLICE
4a1c030j TWO UGANDAN SOLDIERS WERE REPORTED KILLED
4a1c030k NAIROBI WHICH SAID THE UGANDAN TROOPS WERE UNPROVOKED FILED A PROTEST OVER THE UNWARRANTED VIOLATION OF ITS BORDER
4a1c030l <NOISE> BUT SCALI MCCABE WON'T BE EARNING COMMISSIONS FROM THE PURCHASE OF MEDIA SPOTS FOR KIDS R. US
4a1c030m MEDIA PLACEMENT FOR THE UNIT LIKE ITS PARENT IS DONE BY OTHER FIRMS
4a1c030n SCALI MCCABE WILL INSTEAD BE PAID ON A NEGOTIATED FEE BASIS FOR CREATING THE ADS
4a1c030o THE FEES WEREN'T DISCLOSED
4a1c030p CERTAIN ELEMENTS OF A NATIONAL SYSTEM WERE OBVIOUS AND QUICKLY MADE THEIR WAY INTO USE
4a1c030q THE FIRST WAS A COMPOSITE TAPE THAT BROUGHT INFORMATION FROM VARIOUS MARKET CENTERS ONTO ONE TICKER TAPE
4a1c030r A COMPOSITE QUOTATION DISPLAY SYSTEM SOON FOLLOWED ALLOWING CUSTOMERS AND BROKERS TO SEE QUOTES FROM ALL MARKETS ON A SINGLE SCREEN
4a1c030s AND AN INTERMARKET TRADING SYSTEM ALLOWED ORDERS COMING TO VARIOUS EXCHANGE FLOORS TO FLOW FROM ONE EXCHANGE TO ANOTHER QUICKLY EASILY AND AT NO COST
4a1c030t MANY FUND MANAGERS HERE SAY AMERICA ISN'T TAKING THE STRONG MEDICINE NEEDED TO CURB HIGH CONSUMER SPENDING IMPROVE LOW PERSONAL SAVINGS RATES AND COMBAT THE STUBBORN DUAL DEFICITS
4a1c030u THEY DON'T EXPECT ANY PROGRESS BEFORE THE NEW U. S. PRESIDENT TAKES OFFICE NEXT YEAR AND SAY BOTH INFLATION AND INTEREST RATES PROBABLY WILL RISE
4a1c030v THIS WOULD INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF A NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE RECESSION
4a1c030w IT HAS NOW BEEN ELEVEN NIGHTS SINCE THE ARREST OF FRANCIS SEOW FORMER SOLICITOR GENERAL AND LAW SOCIETY PRESIDENT IN SINGAPORE
4a1c030x WHILE PRIME MINISTER LEE KUAN YEW'S GOVERNMENT HAS ADMITTED HOLDING MR. SEOW IT HAS KEPT HIM TOTALLY INCOMMUNICADO
4a1c030y IT HAS REFUSED REQUESTS TO SEE HIM FROM BOTH HIS FAMILY AND HIS LAWYER
4a1c030z WITHIN AN HOUR BARCLAYS P. L. C. LLOYDS BANK P. L. C. AND THE LONDON UNIT OF CITICORP INCREASED THEIR BASE RATES
4a1c0310 <NOISE> THE BARCLAYS BOOST TOOK EFFECT IMMEDIATELY WHILE THE OTHER TWO BANKS' MOVES WERE EFFECTIVE AT THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS
4a1c0311 SIMILAR INCREASES BY NATIONAL WESTMINSTER BANK P. L. C. AND MIDLAND BANK P. L. C. GO INTO EFFECT TODAY
4a1c0312 BASE RATES ARE THE BENCHMARK FOR COMMERCIAL LENDING IN BRITAIN
4a1c0313 THIS LACK OF UNDERSTANDING HAS INVESTORS LICKING THEIR CHOPS ON TWO FRONTS
4a1c0314 ONE CAMP THINKS THAT THE STOCK HAS REMAINED UNDERVALUED AS INVESTORS GRAPPLE TO COMPREHEND THE BUSINESSES
4a1c0315 ANOTHER CAMP HOPES FOR A TAKEOVER OR LEVERAGED BUY OUT THOUGH THE ERIE PENNSYLVANIA COMPANY SAYS IT DOESN'T KNOW OF ANY SUCH THING IN THE WORKS
4a1c0316 HE IS STRIKING NOW AT A TIME WHEN FINANCING FOR BIG DEALS IS READILY AVAILABLE AND THE STOCK PRICE IS DOWN
4a1c0317 <NOISE> AS RECENTLY AS AUGUST R. J. R.'S STOCK WAS TRADING LOWER THAN ITS FORTY NINE DOLLAR LEVEL WHEN MR. JOHNSON TOOK OVER IN JANUARY NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
4a1c0318 THE OFFER FOR A LEVERAGED BUY OUT PROBABLY WILL BE AT ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS A SHARE AND NOW OTHER TOBACCO STOCKS ARE SOARING TOO
4a1c0319 HERE ARE PRICE TRENDS ON THE WORLD'S MAJOR STOCK MARKETS AS CALCULATED BY MORGAN STANLEY CAPITAL INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE GENEVA
4a1c031a TO MAKE THEM DIRECTLY COMPARABLE EACH INDEX IS BASED ON THE CLOSE OF NINETEEN SIXTY NINE EQUALING ONE HUNDRED
4a1c031b THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE IS SINCE YEAR END
4a1c031c ONE NEW DIRECTORATE MEMBER ISN'T LIKELY TO CHANGE *BUNDESBANK* POLICY
4a1c031d BUT *BUNDESBANK* WATCHERS EXPECT MR. TIETMEYER TO SIDE WITH MR. POEHL'S MONETARY POLICIES WHICH EMPHASIZE INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION OVER UNILATERAL ACTIONS
4a1c031e <NOISE> OTHER COUNCIL MEMBERS HAVE FREQUENTLY CLASHED WITH MR. POEHL OVER HIS EFFORT TO COORDINATE WEST GERMAN CURRENCY AND INTEREST RATE MOVES WITH OTHER CENTRAL BANKS
4a1c0401 THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD IN WASHINGTON HAS LOST TRACK OF A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS
4a1c0402 <NOISE> ITS TRACKERS FIGURE THAT AMERICAN ADULTS HAVE EIGHTEEN BILLION DOLLARS IN THEIR POCKETS AND AROUND THE HOUSE
4a1c0403 <NOISE> BUT THAT IS ONLY ABOUT TWELVE PERCENT OF THE BILLS AND LOOSE CHANGE THEY CAN'T DIRECTLY ACCOUNT FOR
4a1c0404 HE TOOK THE TAG NUMBER OF THEIR CAR MR. CLIFTON RECALLED REFERRING TO MR. MCGEE
4a1c0405 AND HE CAME AND GOT ME AND SAID HEY THIS IS THE REAL THING <NOISE>
4a1c0406 IT'S NOT A FLUKE
4a1c0407 IT APPEARS TO BE TRUE
4a1c0408 MANGA FITS NICELY INTO A LIFE STYLE THAT PROVIDES LITTLE TIME OR OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY LIVE ONE'S FANTASIES
4a1c0409 FOR EXAMPLE STUDENTS WHOSE DAYS ACTUALLY ARE SPENT STUDYING BECOME COMIC BOOK SECRET AGENTS AND SOLDIERS
4a1c040a AND A FREQUENT MANGA THEME IS A BOY'S LOVE AFFAIR WITH HIS BUXOM TEACHER
4a1c040b MUCH OF THE OPTIMISM FUELING WESTERN FINANCIAL FLOWS TO THE SOVIETS IS A REACTION TO MR. GORBACHEV'S GLASNOST
4a1c040c BUT THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT HE WILL STILL BE IN POWER WHEN THE SOVIETS OWE SIXTY BILLION DOLLARS
4a1c040d ANOTHER REFORM MINDED LEADER NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV TRIED TO KICK START THE SOVIET ECONOMY IN THE EARLY NINETEEN SIXTIES AND WAS SENT PACKING
4a1c040e NEARLY TWENTY YEARS OF ECONOMIC MISMANAGEMENT FOLLOWED
4a1c040f EVEN IF MR. GORBACHEV SHOULD DELIVER HIS PROMISED REFORMS THERE IS REASON TO DOUBT HE WILL BE ABLE TO MEET PAYMENTS ON ALL THESE NEW LOANS
4a1c040g HUNGARY BEGAN ITS FLIRTATION WITH MARKET ECONOMICS IN NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT YET TODAY IS IN THE MIDST OF A SEVERE DEBT CRUNCH
4a1c040h MORE TRADITIONAL ACADEMICS SAY MANY OF THE NEWER JOURNALS ARE MERELY PLATFORMS FOR MARGINAL SCHOLARS TO WRITE ON TRIVIAL TOPICS
4a1c040i <NOISE> I'M DIMLY AWARE THAT THEY'RE OUT THERE SAYS RICHARD ULLMAN PROFESSOR OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS AT PRINCETON UNIVERSITY AND A FORMER EDITOR OF FOREIGN POLICY MAGAZINE
4a1c040j BUT I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT PEOPLE WHO PUBLISH SOMETHING THAT'S IMPORTANT WOULDN'T WANT TO PUBLISH IN THE LEADING JOURNALS
4a1c040k BUT THAT WAS AN ABERRATION
4a1c040l <NOISE> DICK DOESN'T GET HIGHS AND LOWS LIKE THE REST OF US SAYS D- OKLAHOMA DEMOCRATIC REPUBLICAN MIKE SYNAR A FRIEND AND BACKER
4a1c040m HE'S LIKE THE STAR QUARTERBACK STEADY
4a1c040n THE TEAM KNOWS HE'S THE BEST HOPE THEY'VE GOT
4a1c040o ADMIRAL CROWE ISN'T DEFENSIVE ABOUT MISTAKES
4a1c040p IF THERE'S ONE PROFESSION IN WHICH YOU CAN'T MOUNT AN ERROR FREE OPERATION IT'S THE MILITARY HE SAYS
4a1c040q IN THIS CASE THE J. C. S. CHIEF FEARED THAT CONGRESS MIGHT CURTAIL THE NAVY OPERATION IF THE U. S. REPEATEDLY LOOKED ILL PREPARED
4a1c040r I HAD REALLY UNDERESTIMATED HOW INVOLVED CONGRESS WOULD GET AND HOW DETERMINED THEY WOULD BE TO POLITICIZE IT HE SAYS
4a1c040s THE FOLLOWING OFFICERS DIRECTORS AND LARGE STOCKHOLDERS OF COMPANIES REPORTED CHANGES IN HOLDINGS UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF NINETEEN THIRTY FOUR
4a1c040t THOSE IDENTIFIED AS BENEFICIAL OWNERS HOLD AT LEAST TEN PERCENT OF A COMPANY'S EQUITY SECURITIES
4a1c040u <NOISE> UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED CHANGES INVOLVED DIRECT HOLDINGS OF COMMON STOCK AND TOOK PLACE IN MAY NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT
4a1c040v COMPANIES ARE LISTED WHERE TRANSACTIONS GENERALLY AGGREGATE TEN THOUSAND SHARES OR ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS
4a1c040w MANY PARENTS IMPATIENT FOR CHANGE IN THE SCHOOLS RESPOND BY KEEPING THEIR KIDS OUT OF KINDERGARTEN AN EXTRA YEAR
4a1c040x <NOISE> MOTIVES ARE MIXED
4a1c040y SOME SAY THEY WANT TO PROTECT THEIR CHILDREN OTHERS ANGLE FOR AN AGE ADVANTAGE THAT WILL VAULT THEIR OFFSPRING TO THE HEAD OF THE CLASS THE FOLLOWING YEAR
4a1c040z MANY SCHOOLS ARE ENCOURAGING HOLDOUTS RESULTING IN WHAT SOME EDUCATORS CALL THE GRAYING OF KINDERGARTEN
4a1c0410 FURTHER SIGNS OF STRONG U. S. ECONOMIC GROWTH ARE EXPECTED TO EMERGE FROM A LABOR DEPARTMENT REPORT NEXT FRIDAY ON THE NATION'S EMPLOYMENT PICTURE FOR AUGUST
4a1c0411 <NOISE> IF SO FEDERAL RESERVE OFFICIALS MAY RAISE SHORT TERM INTEREST RATES FURTHER WITHIN A FEW WEEKS SEVERAL ANALYSTS SAID
4a1c0412 THEY ALSO PREDICTED THAT BANKS WILL RAISE THEIR PRIME OR BASE RATES AGAIN TO TEN AND A HALF PERCENT OR ELEVEN PERCENT FROM THE CURRENT TEN PERCENT LEVEL
4a1c0413 <NOISE> AS MANY EMPLOYERS ARE THE BIG BROKER IS ENDING A DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN THAT PROVIDED PENSIONS BASED ON SALARY AND YEARS OF SERVICE
4a1c0414 DEFINED BENEFITS HAVE BECOME COSTLIER TO ADMINISTER BECAUSE OF NEW TAX AND ACCOUNTING RULES
4a1c0415 AND EMPLOYEES TEND TO SEE A PENSION YEARS AWAY AS LESS VALUABLE THAN A PAYMENT HERE AND NOW
4a1c0416 ALL OF THIS HAS LED MORE FIRMS TO ADOPT DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS IN WHICH SALARY AND SERVICE DETERMINE ANNUAL PAYMENTS TO AN EMPLOYEE'S ACCOUNT
4a1c0417 BUT THE COMPANY ALSO IS SUFFERING THE CONSEQUENCES OF SOME BASIC STRATEGIC ERRORS
4a1c0418 FOR EXAMPLE ADVANCED MICRO WAS SLOW TO BEGIN PRODUCING CHIPS MADE WITH A FABRICATION TECHNOLOGY CALLED COMPLEMENTARY METAL OXIDE SEMICONDUCTOR OR CMOS
4a1c0419 THEY USE LESS POWER AND RUN FASTER THAN CONVENTIONAL CHIPS BUT ADVANCED MICRO REMAINED COMMITTED TO AN OLDER TECHNOLOGY UNTIL NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
4a1c041a INVESTORS CONTINUE TO FLOCK TO THE MORE CONSERVATIVE STOCK PORTFOLIOS
4a1c041b <NOISE> GROWTH AND INCOME FUNDS WHICH COMBINE HEFTY DIVIDENDS WITH THE GOAL OF CAPITAL APPRECIATION <NOISE> LED ALL OTHER STOCK FUND CATEGORIES IN SALES FOR JUNE
4a1c041c AMONG BOND FUNDS LONG TERM MUNICIPAL FUNDS CAPTURED THE TOP SPOT
4a2c0201 WHEN HU YAOBANG WAS DUMPED IN JANUARY AS THE COMMUNIST PARTY'S SECRETARY GENERAL MR. ZHAO WAS ELEVATED TO THAT POST ON AN ACTING BASIS
4a2c0202 THAT MADE MR. ZHAO A PROTEGE OF DENG XIAOPING THE DE FACTO HEAD OF THE PARTY AS WELL AS THE GOVERNMENT <NOISE>
4a2c0203 IT IS A DELICATE POSITION REQUIRING HIM TO MANEUVER AMONG VARIOUS INTEREST GROUPS AND PERSONAL CLIQUES THAT MAKE UP CHINA'S TOP LEADERSHIP
4a2c0204 <NOISE> IN THE CAREFREE DAYS BEFORE DEREGULATION IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT FIVE BIG AIRLINES HANDLED MOST OF THE PASSENGER TRAFFIC IN AND OUT OF LAMBERT SAINT
4a2c0205 LOUIS INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT
4a2c0206 THEN CAME THE AIR WARS
4a2c0207 AFTER DECONTROL NINE MORE AIRLINES INVADED THE MARKET ALL TRYING TO LURE A SHARE OF THE TWENTY MILLION TRAVELERS WHO USE THIS AIRPORT EACH YEAR
4a2c0208 IN ASIAN TRADING YESTERDAY THE DOLLAR REBOUNDED FROM WHAT SOME TRADERS SAID WAS AN OVERSOLD CONDITION
4a2c0209 WEDNESDAY'S DECLINE TRIGGERED BUY ORDERS AND SOME TRADERS BOUGHT DOLLARS TO COVER SHORT OR OVERSOLD POSITIONS
4a2c020a BUT AFTER CLIMBING TO INTRADAY HEIGHTS OF ONE POINT EIGHT OH FIVE FIVE MARKS AND ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE POINT SIXTY SIX YEN THE DOLLAR BEGAN SINKING AGAIN
4a2c020b SOUTHLAND WOULD HAVE ABOUT FOUR POINT EIGHTY NINE BILLION DOLLARS OF DEBT AFTER THE BUY OUT IS COMPLETED
4a2c020c THE COMPANY PLANS TO PAY OFF ABOUT ONE BILLION DOLLARS OF THAT BY THE END OF NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE LARGELY FROM THE SALE OF ASSETS
4a2c020d SOUTHLAND EXPECTS PROCEEDS FROM ASSET SALES TO TOTAL EIGHT HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS BY THE END OF NEXT YEAR
4a2c020e BIDS TOTALING THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS WERE SUBMITTED
4a2c020f ACCEPTED BIDS RANGED FROM SEVEN POINT ONE FIVE PERCENT TO SEVEN POINT ONE SEVEN THREE PERCENT
4a2c020g THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY SLATED ANOTHER FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR SALE NEXT TUESDAY
4a2c020h THE ADMINISTRATION EXPECTS ECONOMIC GROWTH TO REBOUND AFTER THE EFFECTS OF THE STOCK MARKET CRASH WANE
4a2c020i IT FORECASTS A THREE POINT FIVE PERCENT GROWTH RATE FOR NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE AND NINETEEN NINETY AND STEADILY FALLING INTEREST RATES AND INFLATION RATES
4a2c020j BUT FORECASTERS INSIDE GOVERNMENT AND OUT HAVE A POOR RECORD IN PREDICTING ECONOMIC TRENDS THAT FAR IN THE FUTURE
4a2c020k FOR A SHIP OR MISSILE GUIDED BY THE WRONG TIME SIGNAL THAT LITTLE GAP COULD MEAN ARRIVING AT THE WRONG DESTINATION
4a2c020l IF WE LET THE DIFFERENCE GROW SAYS MR. MCCARTHY WE COULD RUN INTO PROBLEMS OVER THOUSANDS OF YEARS
4a2c020m IT MIGHT BE NOON BY ATOMIC TIME BUT DARK OUTSIDE <NOISE>
4a2c020n MOREOVER SOME HOUSING SPECIALISTS SAY PERMIT ACTIVITY IS A POOR INDICATOR OF FUTURE STARTS ARGUING THAT IT REFLECTS CURRENT HOUSING ACTIVITY RATHER THAN PREDICTING FUTURE ACTIVITY
4a2c020o THEY PREDICT THAT INSTEAD OF FALLING HOUSING STARTS WILL IMPROVE IN COMING MONTHS IN REACTION TO INCREASING NEW AND EXISTING HOME SALES

4a3c0318 THERE IS A SENSE THAT MR. REAGAN'S SUCCESSOR HASN'T ANY CHOICE BUT TO BE A CONSOLIDATION PRESIDENT
4a3c0319 GIVEN BUDGET CONSTRAINTS AND A RE ENERGIZED CONGRESS SOME HERE BELIEVE A BUSH ADMINISTRATION MAY NOT BE ALL THAT DIFFERENT FROM A DUKAKIS ADMINISTRATION
4a3c031a THOUSANDS OF AZERBAIJAN WORKERS RALLIED IN THE SOVIET REPUBLIC'S CAPITAL BAKU AFTER A DAY OF WORK STOPPAGES TO BACK DEMANDS FOR GREATER LOCAL A- AUTONOMY
4a3c031b IN ESTONIA THE COMMUNIST PARTY CHIEF URGED ETHNIC RUSSIAN WORKERS TO END A SIX DAY STRIKE OVER A NEW LAW TIGHTENING RESIDENCY REQUIREMENTS
4a3c031c STRIKES ALSO WERE THREATENED IN GEORGIA
4a3c0401 HAD THAT HAPPENED THE FAILED BANKS WOULD HAVE BEEN TURNED OVER TO THE F. D. I. C. FOR DISPOSITION
4a3c0402 IN MOST CASES THE AGENCY SELLS THE FAILED BANK TO ANOTHER INSTITUTION ALONG WITH THE GOOD LOANS
4a3c0403 THE F. D. I. C. PURCHASES THE BAD LOANS AND TRIES TO SALVAGE WHATEVER IT CAN
4a3c0404 THESE CRITICISMS ARE OVERWROUGHT AND UNCONVINCING
4a3c0405 WHILE PRIVATE OPERATORS WILL CERTAINLY LOBBY IN THEIR OWN INTEREST IT DOES NOT FOLLOW THAT THEY COULD MANIPULATE PUBLIC OPINION AND LAWMAKERS AS EASILY AS THEIR OPPONENTS SUGGEST
4a3c0406 NOR IS IT CLEAR THAT PRIVATE PRISON OPERATORS WOULD HAVE TO LOBBY FOR HARSHER SENTENCES
4a3c0407 GIVEN CURRENT LEVELS OF OVERCROWDING AND PUBLIC SENTIMENT IN FAVOR OF STRICTER SENTENCING THERE WILL BE NO S- SHORTAGE OF INMATES TO FILL NEW FACILITIES
4a3c0408 ALTHOUGH SOME CABINET MINISTERS HAD BEEN EXPECTED TO STEP DOWN THE MASS ACTION TOOK MANY BY SURPRISE
4a3c0409 MR. BENIGNO SAID TALK OF RESIGNING STARTED DURING A CABINET MEETING
4a3c040a ASKED WHAT CAUSED THE RESIGNATION OFFERS MR. BENIGNO SAID YOU'D HAVE TO INCLUDE THE ENTIRE PANORAMA OF EVENTS SINCE THE AUGUST TWENTY EIGHTH COUP
4a3c040b <NOISE> WHAT LIES AHEAD
4a3c040c <NOISE> MR. BERG CONTENDS THAT INVESTORS SHOULD BE DIVING INTO STOCKS PICKING UP EASY PROFITS IN THE NEXT FIVE MONTHS
4a3c040d A SIX MONTH RALLY IS THE COMMON DENOMINATOR IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE NINETEEN TWENTY NINE AND NINETEEN SIXTY TWO MARKET DROPS HE EXPLAINS
4a3c040e <NOISE> NEVERTHELESS FIRST OPTIONS STILL LETS CUSTOMERS SUCH AS JAMES F. HART TRADE IN NAKED OUT OF THE MONEY PUTS AND CALLS
4a3c040f MR. HART SAYS FIRST OPTION HASN'T SOUGHT TO REIN HIM IN
4a3c040g OTHER BROKERAGE FIRMS HOWEVER HAVE CURBED OR HALTED UNHEDGED OPTION TRADING SINCE THE CRASH
4a3c040h NO ONE HAS LESS CREDIBILITY THAN THE MAN DIRECTLY IN CHARGE OF CENTRAL AMERICAN POLICY ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INTER AMERICAN AFFAIRS ELLIOTT ABRAMS
4a3c040i SOME CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES REFUSE TO HEAR HIM AT ALL OTHERS WILL LISTEN ONLY IF HE TESTIFIES UNDER OATH
4a3c040j <NOISE> ONLY LAST WEEK THE SENATE FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE THREW HIM OUT OF A CLOSED BRIEFING ON THE ALLEGED INVASION
4a3c040k WHY ANYONE SHOULD TAKE SERIOUSLY ANYTHING MR. ABRAMS SAYS ABOUT CENTRAL AMERICA DEFIES COMPREHENSION
4a3c040l <NOISE> NOT LONG AFTER THE NORTHWEST ANNOUNCEMENT THE INSTITUTE WIRED A PRESS RELEASE TO MEDIA ORGANIZATIONS DETAILING THE LARGE NUMBER OF PASSENGER COMPLAINTS ABOUT NORTHWEST'S SERVICE
4a3c040m AIRLINE PASSENGERS WHO FLY NORTHWEST APPEAR TO HAVE A LOT TO COMPLAIN ABOUT AND THEY DID SO IN DROVES LAST YEAR THE RELEASE BEGAN
4a3c040n IT WENT ON TO SAY THAT COMPLAINTS AGAINST NORTHWEST INCREASED ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN PERCENT IN THE PAST YEAR
4a3c040o SOME WONDER WHETHER ALL THE CONVERSIONS DON'T MAKE MR. BEREGOVOY MORE OF AN OPPORTUNIST THAN A BELIEVER IN THE MARKET ECONOMY
4a3c040p BUT HIS AIDES SAY HE WAS CONVINCED THAT HE WAS DOING THE RIGHT THING
4a3c040q MR. BEREGOVOY SAID I'M NOT ASHAMED OF WHAT I DO
4a3c040r BUT CRITICS CHARGED THAT THE COLLAR ACTUALLY ADDED TO VOLATILITY BY MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR INDEX ARBITRAGERS TO DO THEIR BUSINESS
4a3c040s MANY TRADERS ARGUE THAT SUCH ARBITRAGE HAS THE EFFECT OF SMOOTHING OUT VOLATILITY IN THE MARKETS
4a3c040t INDEX ARBITRAGERS BUY AND SELL LARGE AMOUNTS OF STOCKS AND STOCK INDEX FUTURES TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF BRIEF PRICE DISPARITIES BETWEEN THE TWO RELATED INSTRUMENTS
4a3c040u ALMOST UNNOTICED IN DISCUSSIONS OF THE PROCUREMENT SCANDAL IS THE FACT THAT THIS ELABORATE INDEED TORTUOUS SYSTEM SEEMS TO HAVE WORKED AT LEAST ON ITS OWN TERMS
4a3c040v NOBODY WAS ABLE TO THROW A CONTRACT DIRECTLY
4a3c040w INSTEAD WHAT SOME CONTRACTORS SEEM TO HAVE DONE IS TO BUY INSIDE INFORMATION THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO PREPARE A BETTER PROPOSAL
4a3c040x FOR A. B. C. NOW NUMBER TWO A HIT WITH ROSEANNE COULD MEAN A TURNING POINT
4a3c040y PRODUCER MARCY CARSEY SAYS SHE HAS THE SAME FEELING IN HER GUT AS SHE HAD BEFORE THE *DEBUT* OF COSBY
4a3c040z <NOISE> BUT THERE THE SIMILARITY ENDS
4a3c0410 THE COSBY SHOW'S CLARE HUXTABLE IS A LOVING LAWYER AND MATRIARCH IN A TWO HUNDRED DOLLAR SWEATER
4a3c0411 ROSEANNE IS AN ACID TONGUED ASSEMBLY LINE WORKER IN AN OLD SWEATSHIRT
4a3c0412 THAT'S HIS SPECIALTY TEACHING CANDIDATES HOW TO PERFORM ON T. V. COACHING POLITICIANS FOR DEBATES IS A SPECIALTY WITHIN A SPECIALTY
4a3c0413 AS A COACH SAYS BOB GOODMAN OF BALTIMORE ANOTHER MEDIA CONSULTANT ROGER AILES IS IN A CLASS BY HIMSELF
4a3c0414 I SEND MY OWN CLIENTS TO HIM
4a3c0415 <NOISE> ANALYSTS SAY THEY EXPECT P. AND G'S MOMENTUM TO CARRY INTO NINETEEN NINETY AND BEYOND AND MANY RAISED THEIR FISCAL NINETEEN NINETY ESTIMATES
4a3c0416 BRENDA LEE LANDRY OF MORGAN STANLEY RAISED HER ESTIMATE TO EIGHT DOLLARS AND THIRTY CENTS FROM AN EARLIER ESTIMATE OF EIGHT DOLLARS AND FIFTEEN CENTS
4a3c0417 KIDDER'S MR. FREEDMAN AND JOSEPH KOZLOFF AT DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT RAISED THEIR ESTIMATES TO EIGHT DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS A SHARE FROM EIGHT DOLLARS AND TWENTY FIVE CENTS
4a3c0418 I CAN SEE A NUMBER CLOSE TO TEN DOLLARS FOR NINETEEN NINETY ONE SAYS MR. KOZLOFF
4a3c0419 <NOISE> TO THE EXTENT THAT EXPORT GROWTH CONTINUES IT WILL KEEP THE U. S. ECONOMY FROM SLIPPING ADDED MR. WITTEN
4a3c041a SO YOU CAN HAVE A SOFT LANDING SCENARIO BASED ON EXPANDING EXPORTS
4a3c041b A SOFT LANDING COMBINES MODERATE ECONOMIC GROWTH WITH LOW INFLATION
4a3c041c SO WHAT IS WALL STREET TELLING THE QUEASY INVESTORS THAT HOLD SHARES IN GENERIC DRUG MAKERS
4a3c041d <NOISE> IN ESSENCE DON'T WORRY
4a3c041e TAKE TWO ASPIRIN AND CALL ME IN A FEW YEARS
4a4c0201 JOHN SLOAN'S PEOPLE ARE LARGELY TAKEN FOR GRANTED BUT AS IT HAPPENS THEY HAVE BEEN THE STARS OF THE AMERICAN ECONOMY IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES
4a4c0202 <NOISE> AS BIG CORPORATIONS HAVE LAID OFF WORKERS BY THE THOUSANDS TO MEET COMPETITIVE PRESSURES SMALL FIRMS HAVE MORE THAN CUSHIONED THE BLOW
4a4c0203 THEY HAVE CREATED SOME TEN MILLION NEW JOBS SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY ACCORDING TO AN ESTIMATE MADE AT LAST YEAR'S WHITE HOUSE CONFERENCE ON SMALL BUSINESS
4a4c0204 <NOISE> MOREOVER EQUAL OPPORTUNITY IS THE RULE MAINLY BECAUSE SMALL ENTREPRENEURS MAKE THEIR OWN OPPORTUNITIES
4a4c0205 BY ONE ESTIMATE WOMEN NOW ACCOUNT FOR HALF OF NEW BUSINESS START UPS IN THE U. S.
4a4c0206 GENERAL SECORD SAID HE WAS STUNNED TO LEARN THAT DAY OF ADMIRAL POINDEXTER'S RESIGNATION AND COLONEL NORTH'S FIRING
4a4c0207 BESIEGED BY CALLS FROM THE PRESS HE SAID HE WENT TO A HOTEL NEAR HIS OFFICE
4a4c0208 HE SAID COLONEL NORTH MET HIM THERE AND RECEIVED PHONE CALLS FROM PRESIDENT REAGAN AND VICE PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH THANKING HIM FOR HIS CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE GOVERNMENT
4a4c0209 <NOISE> PRESIDENT HUSSEIN'S DOMESTIC STRATEGY AIMED AT SAVING HIS OWN SKIN HAS BEEN CONSIDERABLY MORE SUCCESSFUL
4a4c020a AYATOLLAH KHOMEINI WANTS IRAQIS TO GIVE HIM MR. HUSSEIN'S HEAD AND END THE WAR
4a4c020b HOWEVER MR. HUSSEIN HAS THUS FAR CONVINCED HIS PEOPLE AND FELLOW LEADERS THAT HIS AND HIS NATION'S FATE ARE THE SAME
4a4c020c <NOISE> A FRENCH PRESS REPORT SAID THE EXPORTS INCLUDE SOPHISTICATED EQUIPMENT FOR MAKING SEMICONDUCTORS
4a4c020d IT SAID THE MACHINERY MAY HAVE HELPED THE SOVIETS BUILD ADVANCED COMPUTER MEMORIES FOR SUCH MILITARY PURPOSES AS MISSILE GUIDANCE
4a4c020e <NOISE> WESTERN NATIONS HAVE REACHED AGREEMENTS INTENDED TO FORBID EXPORTS OF SUCH EQUIPMENT TO THE SOVIETS
4a4c020f WHO GOT HER VOTE LAST SEPTEMBER
4a4c020g GENERAL
4a4c020h -(B)USSI SHE SAYS
4a4c020i <NOISE> I THINK WE NEED A HARD HAND
4a4c020j OUTSIDE OF THE CONGRESSIONAL LEADERSHIP PATIENCE IS WEARING THIN ON PORK BARRELING CONTINUING RESOLUTIONS
4a4c020k THERE ARE EVEN CONGRESSMEN WHO SAY THEY WANT TO PASS SEPARATE BUDGET BILLS THIS YEAR
4a4c020l WE'LL SEE
4a4c020m WHAT SEEMS MORE LIKELY IS THAT EITHER A PRESIDENT OR THE COURTS OR BOTH SOMEDAY WILL HAVE TO RESCUE THE VETO BY FORCING CONGRESS TO GIVE UP ITS ARROGANT WAYS
4a4c020n <NOISE> MEANWHILE THE SECURITIES FIRM'S PARENT COMPANY PRUDENTIAL INSURANCE COMPANY OF AMERICA REPORTED MODEST GAINS IN MOST FINANCIAL CATEGORIES
4a4c020o PRUDENTIAL'S CONSOLIDATED ASSETS ROSE FIVE POINT FOUR PERCENT TO A HUNDRED AND FORTY POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS FROM ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
4a4c020p CURRENT BENEFITS TO POLICYHOLDERS ROSE TWO POINT NINE PERCENT TO FOURTEEN POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS FROM THIRTEEN POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS
4a4c020q PROFIT FROM OPERATIONS BEFORE DIVIDENDS AND FEDERAL INCOME TAX INCHED UP TO TWO POINT SIX FIVE BILLION DOLLARS FROM TWO POINT FIVE FIVE BILLION DOLLARS
4a4c020r FELDMUEHLE SHARES ROSE SIXTEEN MARKS YESTERDAY ON FRANKFURT'S STOCK EXCHANGE TO THREE OH NINE POINT FIVE MARKS
4a4c020s <NOISE> BROKERS CITED STRONG FOREIGN DEMAND WHICH DROVE UP TRADING VOLUME IN FELDMUEHLE TO ABOUT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND SHARES NEARLY FOUR TIMES RECENT LEVELS
4a4c020t BUT THE BROKERS SAID THEY DIDN'T BELIEVE ONLY ONE PARTY WAS ACCUMULATING MOST OF THE SHARES
4a4c020u I WAS SHOCKED SAYS MR. KUHLENSCHMIDT
4a4c020v I SAID THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG HERE
4a4c020w I THOUGHT MAYBE THEY STARTED SELLING TIES IN SIZES
4a4c020x BUT I LOOKED AND THERE WASN'T A SIZE ON IT
4a4c020y <NOISE> ONE BIG PLAY LAST YEAR WAS LEISURE
4a4c020z ANOTHER WAS UNDERVALUED ASSETS EVEN THOUGH NO ONE CAN RECALL A JAPANESE COMPANY BEING BROKEN UP FOR ITS ASSETS
4a4c0210 ONCE YOU GET THAT THEME THE LEVEL OF THE PRICE EARNINGS RATIO DOESN'T MEAN A DAMN SAYS MR. ROBINS
4a4c0211 IT'S ALL A BIT OF A MIRAGE
4a4c0212 YET ONE THAT SO FAR HAS WORKED
4a4c0213 MOREOVER MR. FAIR'S PREDICTIONS TEND TO IMPROVE WITH AGE
4a4c0214 <NOISE> BACK IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX HE WAS GIVING PRESIDENT FORD THE INCUMBENT'S FOUR POINT ADVANTAGE
4a4c0215 <NOISE> AFTER THE ELECTION HE TOOK IT AWAY
4a4c0216 UNLIKE LYNDON JOHNSON MR. FORD WASN'T EVER ELECTED VICE PRESIDENT MR. FAIR EXPLAINS FEEBLY
4a4c0217 WHEN MR. FAIR PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF HIS EQUATION TODAY IT STILL SHOWS A FORD VICTORY BUT BY A LESS EMBARRASSING MARGIN
4a4c0218 THIS NOVEL ECONOMIC APPROACH IGNORES THE MERCHANDISE TRADE DEFICIT CENTRAL BANK INTERVENTION AND ALL THAT MUMBO JUMBO
4a4c0219 THAT'S NOT HOW THEY TEACH ECONOMICS AT HAMBURGER UNIVERSITY INSTEAD THE BIG MAC INDEX SIMPLY LOOKS AT WORLD WIDE PRICES OF HAMBURGERS AT TODAY'S EXCHANGE RATES
4a4c021a THAT QUICKLY SHOWS WHICH CURRENCIES ARE TOO STRONG OR WEAK AND BY HOW MUCH
4a4c021b <NOISE> ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COMMODITY COIN IS INDONESIA HURT BY WEAK PETROLEUM PRICES AND LAGGING AGRICULTURAL GROWTH
4a4c021c <NOISE> INDONESIA HAS BOOSTED NON OIL EXPORTS THIS YEAR FOR THE FIRST TIME OIL AND GAS WILL ACCOUNT FOR LESS THAN HALF THE NATION'S EXPORT EARNINGS
4a4c021d THE BRIGHT SPOT CONTINUES TO BE MANUFACTURED EXPORTS LED BY PLYWOOD AND TEXTILES
4a4c021e IF HOLLYWOOD'S INSURERS TOIL IN A WORLD OF MAKE BELIEVE THEY MUST STILL COME UP WITH REAL LIFE WAYS TO MINIMIZE THEIR LOSSES
4a4c021f <NOISE> THE SPECIAL EFFECTS FOR GHOSTBUSTERS TWO REQUIRED A BATTERY OF HOT LIGHTS AND EQUIPMENT THAT WOULD HAVE TRIGGERED THE STUDIO'S SPRINKLER SYSTEM
4a4c021g THE SPRINKLERS WERE TURNED OFF BUT THE INSURER DEMANDED THAT A FIRE COMPANY BE ON THE SET AT ALL TIMES
4a4c0301 THE FOLLOWING OFFICERS DIRECTORS AND LARGE STOCKHOLDERS OF COMPANIES REPORTED CHANGES IN HOLDINGS UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF NINETEEN THIRTY FOUR
4a4c0302 UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED CHANGES INVOLVED DIRECT HOLDINGS OF COMMON STOCK AND TOOK PLACE IN FEBRUARY OR MARCH
4a4c0303 COMPANIES ARE LISTED WHERE TRANSACTIONS GENERALLY AGGREGATE TEN THOUSAND SHARES OR ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS
4a4c0304 <NOISE> THE SALE COMPLETES ALLIED'S PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED DIVESTITURE OF ITS ELECTRONICS AND INSTRUMENTATION BUSINESSES
4a4c0305 <NOISE> THE ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLAR PROGRAM INVOLVED THE SALE OF SEVEN COMPANIES INCLUDING NEPTUNE
4a4c0306 <NOISE> PROCEEDS WILL BE USED TO REDUCE DEBT CONTINUE THE COMPANY'S SHARE BUYBACK PROGRAM AND FOR INVESTMENTS
4a4c0307 WITHIN TWO HOURS DAYTON HUDSON COMMON HIT FIFTY NINE DOLLARS A SHARE ON THE BIG BOARD AND UP TO SIXTY THREE DOLLARS IN OTHER MARKETS
4a4c0308 PEOPLE TOOK POSITIONS IN THE STOCK SIMPLY ON THE RUMOR OF A TAKEOVER BY SOMEONE NO ONE HAD EVER HEARD OF
4a4c0309 SOME OF THE FULL TIME RISK TAKERS DON'T EVEN NEED PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS TO PLUNGE
4a4c030a NOR DO THEY REQUIRE INSIDE INFORMATION A LA IVAN BOESKY WHO WAS VENAL BUT NOT INSANE
4a4c030b THE PEOPLE WHO INVESTED IN DAYTON HUDSON HOWEVER WERE MAD
4a4c030c SOMEBODY DANGLED A FANTASY IN FRONT OF THESE SUPPOSEDLY SAVVY GUYS AND THEY WENT FOR IT LIKE A TROUT TO THE FLY
4a4c030d <NOISE> THAT LEAVES RETAIL BROKERAGE FIRMS WITH A STARK CHOICE
4a4c030e THEY CAN MOVE ONTO THE INSTITUTIONAL FIRMS' TURF AND FIGHT FOR A TOP SPOT IN INVESTMENT BANKING
4a4c030f <NOISE> OR THEY CAN SETTLE INTO THE SECOND RANK OF THE SECURITIES BUSINESS PERHAPS FOREVER
4a4c030g THE COMPLEX PLAN GRADUALLY GIVES THE COMPANY TO THE DEBT HOLDERS SAID CHARLES E. BAYLESS FINANCIAL VICE PRESIDENT
4a4c030h IN CONTRAST IF THE UTILITY BEGAN BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS THEY THE DEBT HOLDERS WOULD GET IT RIGHT NOW HE SAID
4a4c030i <NOISE> IN EITHER CASE THE INTERESTS OF THE UTILITY'S COMMON SHAREHOLDERS WOULD BE SUBSTANTIALLY DILUTED HE SAID
4a4c030j <NOISE> ANOTHER REASON MR. SOIFER IS AVOIDING MORGAN AND CITICORP IS THAT THEIR STOCK PRICES AT TIMES HAVE TENDED TO GYRATE MORE VIOLENTLY THAN OTHER BANK ISSUES
4a4c030k CITICORP AND MORGAN TEND TO HAVE MORE VOLATILITY ON DAYS WHEN PROGRAM TRADING IS KNOWN TO OCCUR MR. SOIFER SAYS
4a4c030l <NOISE> THEY'RE MORE OF A BET ON WHICH WAY THE MARKET IS HEADED
4a4c030m MR. REICHLER RECENTLY STUNNED SOME LIBERALS WHEN HE AGREED TO REPRESENT THE GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT IN ITS QUEST TO WIN U. S. AID FOR ITS POLICE FORCE AND MILITARY
4a4c030n SOME HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS STRONGLY OPPOSED THE REQUEST CITING GUATEMALAN AUTHORITIES' HISTORY OF ABUSES
4a4c030o MR. REICHLER LAUNCHED A LOBBYING BLITZ AMONG U. S. LIBERALS ARGUING THAT THE AID WOULD HELP STEM VIOLATIONS
4a4c030p THE POLICE GOT TWO MILLION DOLLARS FOR TRAINING AND GUATEMALA ALSO GOT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN MILITARY ASSISTANCE
4a4c030q <NOISE> ADMINISTRATORS BLAME THE HIGH COST OF CARE ON SUCH FACTORS AS RISING SALARIES WHICH THEY SAY ACCOUNT FOR AS MUCH AS SIXTY PERCENT OF EXPENSES
4a4c030r THEY SAY A NATIONWIDE NURSING SHORTAGE FORCES THEM TO PAY BONUSES FOR QUALIFIED HELP
4a4c030s BUT EVEN AT THIS PRICE THERE ARE SHORTCOMINGS
4a4c030t <NOISE> SCIENTIFIC STUDIES HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THE DEVICE CAUSED INFECTIONS THAT LED TO SEVERE COMPLICATIONS
4a4c030u ROBINS STILL CONTENDS OTHER FACTORS INCLUDING SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASE CONTRIBUTED TO THE INJURIES
4a4c030v THE COMPANY ALSO INSISTS THE SHIELD ISN'T ANY MORE DANGEROUS THAN OTHER I. U. D.S
4a4c030w NE WIN'S SINGLE PARTY POLITICAL SYSTEM LONG HAS BEEN UNPOPULAR BUT IT HAS REMAINED IN POWER LARGELY BECAUSE OF MILITARY SUPPORT
4a4c030x IN HIS TWENTY SIX YEAR RULE NE WIN TRANSFORMED BURMA FROM ONE OF SOUTHEAST ASIA'S RICHEST SOCIETIES TO ONE OF THE WORLD'S POOREST COUNTRIES
4a4c030y <NOISE> UNDER HIS BURMESE WAY TO SOCIALISM THE STATE TOOK CONTROL OF ALMOST ALL ASPECTS OF ECONOMIC POLITICAL AND SOCIAL LIFE
4a4c030z THE PUBLIC FILINGS SHOW THAT A FIRM CALLED CAMRO ASSOCIATES ACQUIRED A ONE PERCENT NONVOTING STAKE IN SEEMALA IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR
4a4c0310 SEEMALA DISCLOSED THE CAMRO STAKE IN A PUBLIC S. E. C. FILING THAT YEAR SEEMALA DIDN'T IDENTIFY THE INVESTORS IN CAMRO
4a4c0311 BUT A SEPARATE NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR FILING BY CAMRO IN CALIFORNIA IDENTIFIES CAMRO AS A GENERAL PARTNERSHIP MADE UP OF MR. MILKEN AND TWENTY SIX OTHER DREXEL EMPLOYEES
4a4c0312 IN THE CURRENT DEBATE MR. BUSH IS USING THE A. C. L. U. TO PIN A LIBERAL LABEL ON HIS DEMOCRATIC CHALLENGER
4a4c0313 BUT THE A. C. L. U. HAS RELIED THROUGHOUT MUCH OF ITS HISTORY ON REPUBLICAN SUPPORT AND HAS ALLIED ITSELF WITH REPUBLICANS ON NUMEROUS ISSUES
4a4c0314 IN THE CURRENT CONTROVERSY SOME REPUBLICANS ARE TRYING TO MINIMIZE THEIR PAST INVOLVEMENT
4a4c0315 TO BE SURE THE DEFICIT HAS DECLINED IN THE PAST FEW YEARS
4a4c0316 BUT THAT DECLINE IS ENTIRELY THE RESULT OF A RISING SURPLUS IN THE SOCIAL SECURITY TRUST FUND
4a4c0317 THAT MONEY SHOULD BE INVESTED TO HELP DEFRAY THE FUTURE RETIREMENT COSTS OF THE BABY BOOMERS INSTEAD IT IS BEING USED TO PAPER OVER THE DEFICIT
4a4c0318 THAT'S YET ANOTHER SYMPTOM OF MR. DARMAN'S NATIONAL NOW NOW ISM
4a4c0319 OUR PROBLEM IS GETTING THIS VERY VERY ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY TO ACTUALLY WORK SAYS ANTHONY SIMONDS GOODING BRITISH SATELLITE'S CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
4a4c031a OUR CREDIBILITY IS CLOSE TO ZERO UNTIL THEN
4a4c031b SOME ANALYSTS TAKE A HARSHER VIEW
4a4c031c THERE IS A SERIOUS QUESTION MARK OVER B. S. B. MANAGEMENT SAYS MARK ASTAIRE A MEDIA ANALYST AT U. K. BROKERS HOARE GOVETT LIMITED
4a4c031d SO FAR EVERYTHING HAS GONE WRONG
4a4c0401 THAT HARDLY MATTERS SAYS SIR GEOFFREY NOTING THAT WITH ALL THE TRAITOR SPIES THAT PRECEDED HIM THERE WASN'T MUCH LEFT TO TELL
4a4c0402 THE POINT IS HE WAS ONE OF US
4a4c0403 HE JOINED M. I. FIVE STRAIGHT OUT OF OXFORD
4a4c0404 BEEN IN THE CIVIL SERVICE ALL HIS LIFE
4a4c0405 THE SALE ALSO PROVIDES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WITH CASH AS IT TRIES TO NARROW THE BUDGET DEFICIT
4a4c0406 AFTER SUBTRACTING UNDERWRITERS' FEES OF ABOUT SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS THE GOVERNMENT'S NET PROCEEDS FROM THE OFFERING ARE ONE POINT FIVE EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS
4a4c0407 IN ADDITION THE GOVERNMENT HAS ALREADY BEEN PAID THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FROM CONRAIL'S CASH RESERVES UNDER PROVISIONS OF THE PUBLIC OFFERING
4a4c0408 A SOURCE CLOSE TO TEXACO SAID THAT WHILE TEXACO IS ANXIOUS TO EMERGE FROM CHAPTER ELEVEN IT ISN'T IN THE COMPANY'S OR SHAREHOLDERS' INTEREST TO RUSH INTO A SETTLEMENT
4a4c0409 IT'S NORMAL FOR CREDITORS TO WANT A QUICK SETTLEMENT
4a4c040a BUT TEXACO'S SHAREHOLDERS HAVE A BIG SAY IN THIS CASE AND THEY AREN'T PUSHING FOR A SETTLEMENT FOR SETTLEMENT'S SAKE THE SOURCE SAID
4a4c040b <NOISE> BUT ON TUESDAY KIDDER PEABODY'S JACK KIRNAN DROPPED CHRYSLER TO A HOLD RATING
4a4c040c VANS AND TRUCKS ARE SELLING WELL HE CONCEDES BUT CHRYSLER'S CAR SALES HAVE BEEN VERY DISAPPOINTING
4a4c040d HE ALSO FIGURES CHRYSLER WILL TAKE LONGER THAN EXPECTED TO STRAIGHTEN OUT AMERICAN MOTORS WHICH IT ACQUIRED WEDNESDAY
4a4c040e BUT EVEN INVESTORS WHO DO ALL THE HOMEWORK AND REQUEST ALL THE DOCUMENTS SHOULDN'T FEEL TOO COMPLACENT
4a4c040f THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MUST BE UPDATED EVERY YEAR SO NEW PROSPECTUSES ARE ISSUED ANNUALLY
4a4c040g SOMETIMES ONLY THE PER SHARE DATA TABLE CHANGES BUT OFTEN OTHER REVISIONS ARE INCLUDED
4a4c040h THE MINISTERS NEXT WILL GO TO KUWAIT THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES AND IRAQ ALL SAID TO BE PRODUCING BEYOND THEIR QUOTAS
4a4c040i FINAL STOPS ON THIS LEG OF THE TOUR WILL BE QATAR AND IRAN
4a4c040j A SECOND TRIP TO OTHER OPEC COUNTRIES IS SET FOR NOVEMBER
4a4c040k THE WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY FOR THE CREATION OF SUPERREGIONAL BANKS MIGHT NOT BE OPEN LONG
4a4c040l THEN WE WILL FACE THE CHALLENGE OF CONSOLIDATING OUR POSITIONS
4a4c040m IT'S GOING TO BE TOUGH
4a4c040n WHAT HAS DISTINGUISHED US IS THAT OUR RETURNS ON ASSETS AND EQUITY ARE FAR ABOVE AVERAGE
4a4c040o MAINTAINING THOSE LEVELS THAT'S GOING TO BE THE CHALLENGE
4a4c040p YET HE STRIVES TO REASSURE CANADA'S MIDDLE CLASS CALLING HIMSELF A SCANDINAVIAN STYLE SOCIAL DEMOCRAT WHO APPRECIATES THE BENEFITS OF CAPITALISM
4a4c040q THERE'S NO MINDLESS ATTEMPT TO SAY WE'RE GOING TO TAX PRIVATE CORPORATIONS OUT OF EXISTENCE HE SAYS
4a4c040r THAT'S SILLY YOU DON'T DO THAT
4a4c040s YOU WANT THEM TO DO WELL
4a4c040t BUT SCALI MCCABE WON'T BE EARNING COMMISSIONS FROM THE PURCHASE OF MEDIA SPOTS FOR KIDS R. US
4a4c040u MEDIA PLACEMENT FOR THE UNIT LIKE ITS PARENT IS DONE BY OTHER FIRMS
4a4c040v SCALI MCCABE WILL INSTEAD BE PAID ON A NEGOTIATED FEE BASIS FOR CREATING THE ADS
4a4c040w THE FEES WEREN'T DISCLOSED
4a4c040x BUT CRITICS CHARGED THAT THE COLLAR ACTUALLY ADDED TO VOLATILITY BY MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR INDEX ARBITRAGERS TO DO THEIR BUSINESS
4a4c040y MANY TRADERS ARGUE THAT SUCH ARBITRAGE HAS THE EFFECT OF SMOOTHING OUT VOLATILITY IN THE MARKETS
4a4c040z INDEX ARBITRAGERS BUY AND SELL LARGE AMOUNTS OF STOCKS AND STOCKS INDEX FUTURES TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF BRIEF PRICE DISPARITIES BETWEEN THE TWO RELATED INSTRUMENTS
4a4c0410 BANKERS TRUST'S QUARTERLY PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES TOTALED FIVE MILLION DOLLARS COMPARED WITH TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR EARLIER
4a4c0411 BUT THE BANK HAD NET RECOVERIES OF THREE POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS COMPARED WITH NINETEEN MILLION DOLLARS OF NET CHARGE OFFS IN THE YEAR EARLIER QUARTER
4a4c0412 AND THE TOTAL ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES REMAINED UNCHANGED AT ONE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS
4a4c0413 JOINT VENTURE PROJECTS THAT ARE STILL UNDER NEGOTIATION ARE TO BE SCRUTINIZED CHINESE OFFICIALS SAY
4a4c0414 THOSE INVOLVING CONSTRUCTION OF HOTELS OR OFFICE BUILDINGS AREN'T LIKELY TO WIN GOVERNMENT APPROVAL
4a4c0415 CHINA IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO APPROVE MOST INVESTMENTS IN EXPORT RELATED INDUSTRIES AND IN PROJECTS COVERING ENERGY TRANSPORT COMMUNICATIONS RAW MATERIALS AND CHEMICALS
4a4c0416 A SHORTAGE OF ENERGY AND RAW MATERIALS IS ALREADY WREAKING HAVOC IN MANY OF CHINA'S MAJOR INDUSTRIES
4a4c0417 A FACTORY THAT MAKES NIKE SHOES IN GUANGDONG PROVINCE HAS TO RUN A GENERATOR THREE DAYS A WEEK TO STAY IN OPERATION
4a4c0418 THE PLANT'S TAIWANESE JOINT VENTURE PARTNERS ARE STOCKPILING COAL AND OIL FOR POWER IN CASE THEIR SUPPLIES GET CUT OFF
4a4c0419 MANY NEARBY CHINESE FACTORIES SIMPLY SHUT DOWN TWO OR THREE DAYS A WEEK FOR WANT OF ENERGY
4a4c041a MOREOVER TWO THOUSAND WORKERS AT THE TIANJIN ALUMINUM PRODUCTS FACTORY RECENTLY WERE ORDERED HOME BECAUSE THE COMPANY COULDN'T GET ENOUGH RAW MATERIALS
4a4c041b AT ONE POINT THIS YEAR SUPPLY SHORTAGES FORCED A THIRD OF THE NATION'S ALUMINUM FACTORIES TO CLOSE
4a4c041c MEANWHILE CIVIL RICO CONTINUES TO ATTRACT PLAINTIFFS WHO WANT TO TURN GENERAL BUSINESS DISPUTES THAT BELONG IN STATE COURTS INTO FEDERAL OFFENSES
4a4c041d FOR EXAMPLE A SMALL CONSORTIUM OF CONTRACTORS WHO CONSULTED ME HAD SUBMITTED THE LOW BID FOR A LARGE MARINA TO BE CONSTRUCTED ON LAKE MICHIGAN
4a4c041e THE SECOND LOWEST BIDDER RECENTLY FILED A CIVIL RICO ACTION CLAIMING THAT MISREPRESENTATIONS WERE MADE BY THE SUCCESSFUL BIDDERS USING THE TELEPHONE THEREBY COMMITTING FEDERAL WIRE FRAUD
4a4c041f NO MATTER WHAT THE DETERMINATION OF THE SUIT THE LOW BIDDERS ALREADY HAVE FELT THE STING OF SUCH POISONOUS WORDS AS RACKETEER
4a5c0201 SUCH RESULTS ARE CAUSING SOME WALL STREET PROFESSIONALS TO TAKE THE JANUARY INDICATOR LESS *SERIOUSLY* THAN THEY USED TO
4a5c0202 IN PUTTING LESS EMPHASIS ON SOME OF THESE TRADITIONAL *BAROMETERS* SAYS EUGENE PERONI DIRECTOR OF TECHNICAL RESEARCH FOR JANNEY MONTGOMERY SCOTT INC. IN PHILADELPHIA
4a5c0203 THEY ARE NOT THE MOST SCIENTIFIC THINGS AROUND
4a5c0204 MR. WALTER WOULD BE RICH IF NOT FOR HIS AWFUL BUSINESS SENSE SAYS HIS BROTHER DANIEL A MARKETING EXECUTIVE
4a5c0205 MY MOTHER SAYS GO HELP YOUR BROTHER
4a5c0206 I SAY THE ONLY WAY I COULD HELP HIM IS WITH A GARBAGE TRUCK TO HAUL AWAY THE OLD COMPUTER MANUALS THAT LITTER HIS APARTMENT
4a5c0207 LIKE THEIR ECONOMIES THE CURRENCY OF THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA ARE CLOSELY RELATED
4a5c0208 BUT AS INTEREST RATES RISE IN CANADA THE CANADIAN DOLLAR IS GAINING ON ITS U. S. COUNTERPART TRADERS AND ANALYSTS SAY
4a5c0209 AND AS THE CANADIAN UNIT RISES IT LURES MORE FOREIGN INVESTMENT PARTICULARLY FROM JAPAN WHICH ADDS TO ITS STRENGTH <NOISE>
4a5c020a IN VIEDMA MEANWHILE DEPUTY GOVERNOR OSCAR MACHADO EXUDES PROVINCIAL CONFIDENCE
4a5c020b HE HAS PUT UP A SIGN IN THE MAIN SQUARE WELCOMING VISITORS TO THE NEW FEDERAL CAPITAL
4a5c020c HE ACTUALLY BELIEVES HIS CORNER OF PATAGONIA WILL SOON BE ADORNED WITH NEW ROADS TELEPHONES EMBASSIES AND HOTELS
4a5c020d HE SAYS HE EXPECTS PRESIDENT ALFONSIN TO START COMING REGULARLY NEXT YEAR
4a5c020e IN MORE RECENT TIMES THE LEGAL PROFESSION HAS AN EXCLUSIVE CLUB THAT LOOKED AFTER ITS OWN
4a5c020f SQUABBLES WERE SETTLED BEHIND THE COURTHOUSE
4a5c020g LAWYERLY MISDEEDS WERE HUSHED UP OR HU:RRIEDLY RESOLVED
4a5c020h CLIENTS WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT SCANDALOUS TO SUE THE FAMILY OR COMPANY LAWYER
4a5c020i GENERAL RAMOS ALSO CONFIRMED FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT PHILIPPINE AUTHORITIES WERE LOOKING INTO POSSIBLE FOREIGN INVOLVEMENT IN THE COUP ATTEMPT THE ASSOCIATED PRESS REPORTED
4a5c020j GENERAL RAMOS SAID THE MILITARY WAS INVESTIGATING THE PRESENCE OF SOME FOREIGN PERSONNEL NEAR ARMED FORCES HEADQUARTERS DURING THE UPRISING
4a5c020k HE DECLINED TO ELABORATE

4a5c020p IT'S WORSE THAN A JERRY BUILT HOUSE <NOISE>
4a5c020q FROM THE BANKS' STANDPOINT HE CHARACTERIZED THE PROPOSED AGREEMENT AS ALMOST WORSE THAN LENDING THEMSELVES THE MONEY
4a5c020r HE HELPED US TO LOOK AT DIFFERENT OPTIONS SAYS ALFRED S. WARREN THE G. M. VICE PRESIDENT LEADING THE NEGOTIATIONS UNDER MR. JOHNSON
4a5c020s HE WAS VERY *REFRESHING* IN SOME OF HIS THOUGHTS AND IDEAS

4a5c020x YET IT IS A MOMENT QUICKLY ENDED
4a5c020y IN THIS BLEAK WORLD THE FUTURE WOULD SEEM TO BELONG TO THE TYRANTS AND TERRORISTS
4a5c020z OVER HALF A CENTURY FEDERAL POLICY HAS SAPPED THE PRODUCTIVITY OF THE WORLD'S STRONGEST AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY
4a5c0210 THE REAL ISSUE IS NOT THE DOLLAR AMOUNT OF U. S. FOOD EXPORTS BUT WHETHER THOSE EXPORTS ARE SOLD AT A PROFIT OR A LOSS
4a5c0211 THE SOONER POLITICIANS STOP TRYING TO HELP FARMERS THE BETTER OFF THE MOST EFFICIENT PRODUCTIVE FARMERS WILL BE

4a5c0217 MR. BILZERIAN HAS SENT HIS BOY TO A LITTLE LEAGUE TEAM IN FARAWAY MINNESOTA WHERE THE FAMILY SPENDS ITS SUMMERS AND ISN'T COACHING A TEAM THIS YEAR
4a5c0218 ALL THE ACTION APPARENTLY WILL BE IN THE COURTROOM
4a5c0219 UNTIL NOW SANCTIONS BACKERS IN CONGRESS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO USE SOUTH AFRICA FOR THEIR OWN DOMESTIC POLITICAL PURPOSES WITHOUT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE FULL COSTS
4a5c021a THE SUFFERING THAT SANCTIONS HAVE INFLICTED ON BLACKS AND THE LOSS OF U. S. INFLUENCE IN THE REGION HAVE NOT IMPRESSED THEM MUCH
4a5c021b BUT THE NEXT ROUND WILL DO MORE SEVERE DAMAGE ON THEIR OWN CONSTITUENTS
4a5c021c THAT WILL BE SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT AS THE SENATE DEBATES WHETHER TO SECOND THE SCORCHED EARTH POLICY THE HOUSE HAS ADOPTED
4a5c021d BROKERAGE FIRMS WHICH NEGOTIATE RATES WITH THE BANKS AND THRIFTS WHOSE C. D.S THEY SELL OFFER SOME OF THE BEST YIELDS
4a5c021e THE AVERAGE YIELD ON A BROKER SOLD THREE MONTH C. D. FOR EXAMPLE WAS EIGHT POINT SIX SIX PERCENT
4a5c021f THE AVERAGE YIELD ON TWO YEAR C. D.S SOLD BY BROKERS ROSE NEARLY A FIFTH OF A PERCENTAGE POINT TO EIGHT POINT FOUR THREE PERCENT

4a5c0302 REDEVELOPMENT COMMISSION THE RETIRED FOOD COMPANY EXECUTIVE TOOK PRIDE IN HELPING HIS CITY GROW
4a5c0303 BUT HE ALSO LOVED THE FREE SILVER PASS THAT DISNEYLAND GAVE HIM EVERY YEAR AS ONE OF NEARLY ONE THOUSAND LOCAL NOTABLES SO HONORED

4a5c030z ROLL CALL CAN FIND ONLY TWELVE
4a5c0310 MS. LIU HAD HER FIRST CHILD A BOY TWO YEARS AGO
4a5c0311 SHE WAS URGED NOT TO HAVE ANOTHER
4a5c0312 SHE WAS EASY TO DEAL WITH THE PARTY SECRETARY BOASTS
4a5c0313 THE TROUBLED MAKER OF PRODUCTION EQUIPMENT FOR THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY DIDN'T GIVE ANY ESTIMATES OF ITS EXPECTED LOSSES AND COMPANY OFFICIALS COULDN'T BE REACHED FOR COMMENT

4a5c0401 BRITAIN IS LAUNCHING A NATIONWIDE AIDS WARNING CAMPAIGN THAT URGES THE USE OF CONDOMS FOR PEOPLE WHO WON'T RESTRICT THEIR SEXUAL PARTNERS
4a5c0402 LEAFLETS THAT ARE BEING DELIVERED TO TWENTY THREE MILLION HOUSEHOLDS WARN THAT AIDS ISN'T LIMITED TO HOMOSEXUALS
4a5c0403 OFFICIALS SAY TELEVISION WARNINGS WILL FOLLOW
4a5c0404 HOWEVER THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION HAS ITS OWN PRIORITIES
4a5c0405 IT HAS BEEN PRESSURING GERMANY TO CUT ITS INTEREST RATES TO STIMULATE ECONOMIC GROWTH AND BY IMPLICATION CREATE A BIGGER MARKET FOR U. S. EXPORTS
4a5c0406 THIS EXPLAINS THE WAR OF WORDS OVER GERMANY'S REFUSAL TO CUT INTEREST RATES FOR MUCH OF LAST YEAR
4a5c0407 THE DISPUTE CAN BE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE AFTER THE PRESENT CENTER RIGHT COALITION GOVERNMENT OF CHANCELLOR HELMUT KOHL RECORDS ITS EXPECTED ELECTION VICTORY NEXT WEEK
4a5c0408 I THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT
4a5c0409 HAVE YOU GIVEN ANY SERIOUS THOUGHT TO DIVERSIFYING
4a5c040a MAYBE YOU SHOULD HAVE A VARIETY OF HOLDINGS IN YOUR PORTFOLIO
4a5c040b OR PERHAPS YOU SHOULD LIMIT YOUR EXPOSURE BY HEDGING
4a5c040c YOU COULD PLAY A GAME ON BOTH SIDES OF THIS DEAL I SUGGESTED EARNESTLY
4a5c040d THE DIET IS A ONE HOUSE LEGISLATURE APPORTIONED BY DISTRICT RATHER THAN POPULATION LIKE THE SENATE AS OPPOSED TO THE HOUSE
4a5c040e THIS MEANS THAT JAPANESE FARMERS HAVE TREMENDOUS CONTROL OVER JAPANESE POLITICS
4a5c040f FOOD PRICES IN JAPAN TAKE FORTY PERCENT OR MORE OF THE AVERAGE PERSON'S WAGE
4a5c040g WITH HOUSING TAKING ANOTHER FORTY PERCENT AND THE FACT THAT THE JAPANESE ARE GREAT SAVERS THEY A(RE)- LEFT WITH ALMOST NO DISCRETIONARY INCOME
4a5c040h THIS IS WHY THEY CANNOT DEVELOP A DOMESTIC MARKET
4a5c040i THEY DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO SPEND EXCEPT A SMALL AMOUNT OF SAVINGS THAT THEY SPEND ONLY ON SOCIAL OCCASIONS OR FOR UNUSUAL BARGAINS
4a5c040j BUT MANY TIBETANS CONSIDER THE DALAI LAMA TO BE THEIR RIGHTFUL POLITICAL LEADER AS WELL SOMETHING THE CHINESE CAN'T ACCEPT
4a5c040k TRAVELERS KEPT TIBETANS WELL INFORMED OF THE DALAI LAMA'S RECENT VISIT TO THE U. S. AND HIS CALLS FOR TIBETAN INDEPENDENCE
4a5c040l WHEN THE CHINESE PRESS IN TIBET RESPONDED BY SAVAGELY ATTACKING BOTH THE PRO INDEPENDENCE MOVEMENT AND THE DALAI LAMA HIMSELF THE MONKS WERE MOVED TO ACTION
4a5c040m AT DREPUNG THEY SET TO WORK CRAFTING TIBETAN FLAGS WHICH THEY USED IN THE INITIAL PRO INDEPENDENCE MARCH SEPTEMBER TWENTY SEVENTH
4a5c040n CHRYSLER CORPORATION HAS EXTENDED HOLIDAYS AT FOUR PLANTS AND IN SOME CASES INDEFINITELY SLOWED PRODUCTION

4a5c040t AND TAPES SUITABLE FOR ALL AGE GROUPS ARE PACKAGED IN GREEN
4a5c040u THE DIFFERENT COLORED CASINGS ARE MADE BY A LOCAL COMPANY
4a5c040v ACCORDING TO SOME PHYSICIANS THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE WITH BUSY YOUNG PROFESSIONALS
4a5c040w THEY REFUSE TO REST AND DEMAND TREATMENT WITH ANTIBIOTICS
4a5c040x BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE FLU ANTIBIOTICS ARE USELESS
4a5c040y SUCH DRUGS ARE DESIGNED TO FIGHT BACTERIA NOT VIRUSES
4a5c040z AS FOR PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS WALL STREET'S EUPHEMISM FOR TRIGGER HAPPY TRADING IT'S A BIT HARDER TO GAUGE THE RISKS
4a5c0410 THE FIRM IS A BIG GOVERNMENT BOND TRADER AND HAS GROWN A LOT IN FOREIGN CURRENCY TRADING
4a5c0411 AND AMONG MORGAN STANLEY'S BIGGEST PERCENTAGE GAINS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN WAS EQUITY PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS WHICH NEARLY TRIPLED TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS IN REVENUE

4a5c0417 MULTIFAMILY HOUSING STARTS FELL NINE POINT FIVE PERCENT IN JUNE AND TWENTY TWO PERCENT IN MAY
4a5c0418 THE REBOUND IN JULY REFLECTS AN EASING OF BACKLOGS IN PERMIT APPROVALS FOR THIS SECTOR MR. SHEEHAN SAID

4a5c041a THIS HASN'T BEEN A GOOD YEAR FOR SUNDSTRAND
4a5c041b THE ROCKFORD ILLINOIS AEROSPACE CONTRACTOR EXPECTS TO PAY OUT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN A GOVERNMENT CONTRACT DISPUTE
4a5c041c IT IS FORECASTING LOWER EARNINGS

4a5c041g IN OTHER DEVELOPMENTS CORN AND WHEAT PRICES WERE MOSTLY HIGHER IN A REBOUND FROM MONDAY'S SESSION WHEN CORN SET NEW LIFE OF CONTRACT LOWS
4a5c041h MANY TRADERS BOUGHT CONTRACTS TO COVER SHORT OR SELLING POSITIONS
4a5c041i ANALYSTS SAID TECHNICAL FACTORS ALSO PLAYED A PART AS PRICES BACKED AND FILLED THE GAPS LEFT ON PRICE CHARTS BY MONDAY'S STEEP DROP
4a6c0201 MR. HENKEL A FORMER ATLANTA ATTORNEY WAS APPOINTED TO THE THREE MEMBER BANK BOARD BY PRESIDENT REAGAN NOVEMBER SEVEN
4a6c0202 HE HAS PUT ALL HIS BUSINESS INTERESTS THAT HAD TRANSACTIONS WITH THRIFTS INCLUDING THOSE WITH LOANS FROM LINCOLN INTO A BLIND TRUST
4a6c0203 HE HAS ALSO SAID HE INTENDS TO RECUSE HIMSELF FROM BANK BOARD VOTES SPECIFICALLY INVOLVING THRIFTS HE HAS DEALT WITH INCLUDING LINCOLN
4a6c0204 HER HUSBAND CARL IS A PENNSYLVANIA STATE TROOPER
4a6c0205 TO AVOID ANY CONFLICT OVER SALARIES THEY PUT HER FORTY SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS ANNUAL INCOME IN A SAVINGS ACCOUNT AND LIVE OFF HIS THIRTY ONE THOUSAND DOLLAR INCOME

4a6c0207 BUSINESS AND REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT GROUPS PREDICT THAT THE CAP WOULD LEAD TO ECONOMIC DISASTER
4a6c0208 HOMEOWNER AND ENVIRONMENTALIST GROUPS APPLAUD THE PLAN AS A WAY TO CONTROL THE CITY'S GROWTH
4a6c0209 HOUSING STARTS IN THE CITY SET A RECORD LAST YEAR AND ARE ON THE SAME PACE THIS YEAR
4a6c020a <NOISE> WHAT REMAINS FOR HISTORY TO JUDGE IS FIRST HOW WELL HE SUCCEEDED
4a6c020b HERE THE JUDGMENT MAY BE MIXED
4a6c020c WE DO HAVE LESS TAXES AND LESS INFLATION BUT BIGGER SPENDING AND AS MUCH GOVERNMENT AS BEFORE
4a6c020d HISTORY'S SECOND JUDGMENT WILL BE WHETHER HIS YEARS REPRESENT A MERE PASSING CHANGE OR WHETHER THE CHANGE WILL ENDURE
4a6c020e WE CANNOT SAY TODAY BECAUSE WE CANNOT KNOW WHAT COMES HEREAFTER AND WHAT COMES HEREAFTER WILL DECIDE MR. REAGAN'S PLACE AMONG OUR PRESIDENTS
4a6c020f SABOTEURS ARE OUR BIGGEST PROBLEM SAYS MR. CAIRO REFERRING TO THE BEVY OF PEOPLE WHO SHIELD THE DEBTOR
4a6c020g AT THE OFFICE THE COLLECTOR'S NATURAL ENEMIES ARE SWITCHBOARD OPERATORS AND SECRETARIES SO MR. CAIRO ADVISES CALLING THE DEBTOR BEFORE NINE AFTER FIVE AND DURING LUNCH
4a6c020h AT THAT TIME THE PREY HIMSELF MAY ANSWER
4a6c020i MR. WASHINGTON GREW UP IN CHICAGO POLITICS
4a6c020j AS A TEEN AGER HE DISTRIBUTED LEAFLETS FOR HIS FATHER ROY A PRECINCT WORKER ON THE SOUTH SIDE
4a6c020k AFTER SERVING AS AN ARMY SERGEANT ON GUAM DURING WORLD WAR TWO HE EARNED A LAW DEGREE FROM NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY
4a6c020l HIS MARRIAGE TO HIS HIGH SCHOOL SWEETHEART ENDED IN DIVORCE IN NINETEEN FIFTY ONE
4a6c020m BUT HE ADVANCED THROUGH A SERIES OF DEMOCRATIC PATRONAGE JOBS TO ELECTION TO THE STATE LEGISLATURE AND FINALLY TO CONGRESS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY
4a6c020n THE MOST ACTIVE ISSUE WAS INTEL THE BIG SEMICONDUCTOR COMPANY WHICH ROSE ONE FOURTH TO TWENTY EIGHT AND ONE FOURTH
4a6c020o BUT SOME OTHER BIG ELECTRONICS SHARES SURGED LATE IN THE DAY
4a6c020p S. C. I. SYSTEMS CLIMBED THREE QUARTERS TO FOURTEEN AND THREE EIGHTHS ON TWO HUNDRED AND NINE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED SHARES
4a6c020q <NOISE> THE TEXSTYRENE CASE ALSO ILLUSTRATES THE SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DREXEL AND EXECUTIVE LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY A *SUBSIDIARY* OF FIRST EXECUTIVE CORPORATION IN LOS ANGELES
4a6c020r DREXEL KEPT NINE MILLION DOLLARS OF THE TEXSTYRENE BONDS IT HAD BOUGHT BACK FROM ITS EMPLOYEE ACCOUNTS FOR A HUNDRED AND SIX AND A HALF FOR ONLY TWO TRADING DAYS
4a6c020s IT THEN SOLD TEN MILLION DOLLARS OF S- TEXSTYRENE BONDS FOR A HUNDRED AND EIGHT POINT TWO TO EXECUTIVE LIFE
4a6c020t WHEN THE FEDERAL RESERVE EARLIER THIS MONTH RAISED THE DISCOUNT RATE IT DIDN'T INCREASE ITS POPULARITY
4a6c020u G. O. P. POLITICIANS PUBLICLY DAMNED THE MOVE WITH FAINT PRAISE AND PRIVATELY WORRIED THAT THE FED WAS CREATING A RECESSION THAT WOULD WIPE OUT GEORGE BUSH
4a6c020v DEMOCRAT MICHAEL DUKAKIS WAS A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE BUT ALLOWED AS HOW HE COULD SEE THE NEED FOR THE MOVE
4a6c020w MR. BRIGHT IS A *QUINTESSENTIAL* TEXAS BUSINESSMAN WHOSE FORTUNES HAVE PLUNGED IN RECENT YEARS ALONG WITH THE STATE'S
4a6c020x WITH INTERESTS IN ENERGY REAL ESTATE AND BANKING MR. BRIGHT HAS HAD AN UNLUCKY HAND IN EACH OF TEXAS' MOST TROUBLED INDUSTRIES
4a6c020y FORBES MAGAZINE ESTIMATES THAT MR. BRIGHT'S FORTUNE HAS BEEN HALVED TO THREE HUNDRED MILLION FROM SIX HUNDRED MILLION A FEW YEARS AGO
4a6c020z THE TROUBLED MAKER OF PRODUCTION EQUIPMENT FOR THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY DIDN'T GIVE ANY ESTIMATES OF ITS EXPECTED LOSSES AND COMPANY OFFICIALS COULDN'T BE REACHED FOR COMMENT
4a6c0210 IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN SOLITEC EARNED TWO HUNDRED AND TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS OR SIX CENTS A SHARE ON REVENUE OF THIRTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS

4a6c0214 TO BE SURE ON A LOT OF SCORES THE SUMMIT WAS A SUCCESS
4a6c0215 ECONOMIC COOPERATION WAS ADVANCED WITH BUSINESSMEN SIGNING AGREEMENTS FOR ABOUT THIRTY CONTRACTS AND SEVERAL JOINT VENTURES
4a6c0216 HUMAN RIGHTS TOO MAY HAVE TAKEN A STEP FORWARD IF MR. GORBACHEV LIVED UP TO HIS PROMISE TO RELEASE ALL POLITICAL PRISONERS BY YEAR'S END
4a6c0217 IN WASHINGTON SOMEONE WHO GETS CUT OFF AT THE KNEES CAN NEVER COME BACK
4a6c0218 POOR JOHN TOWER CAN'T COME BACK

4a6c021a <NOISE> S. AND P'S EVENT RISK COVENANT RANKINGS WHICH WERE STARTED LAST MONTH HAVE FIVE CATEGORIES
4a6c021b E. THREE STANDS MIDWAY
4a6c021c TRADERS HAVE SAID THAT BOWATER BONDS WAS THE BEST RECEIVED DEAL IN THE PAST TWO SESSIONS BECAUSE OF STRONG INVESTOR DEMAND FOR EVENT RISK PROTECTION
4a6c021d MR. MARTENS SAID VITRO WASN'T PREPARED TO AGREE TO THAT CONDITION

4a6c0304 THE REMAINING OFFSETTING COLLECTIONS OF MORE THAN THREE MILLION DOLLARS COMES FROM USER FEES WHICH ALSO CLEARLY ARE NOT TAXES
4a6c0305 A USER FEE IS A SPECIFIC CHARGE FOR A DIRECT BENEFIT RECEIVED
4a6c0306 LIKE AN ASSET SALE BUT UNLIKE A TAX A USER FEE DOES NOT INVOLVE COMPULSION
4a6c0307 ONE CHARACTERISTIC OF USER FEES IS THAT THEY REVEAL HOW MUCH GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS ARE REALLY WORTH TO DIRECT RECIPIENTS IN THE MOST DIRECT AND MEANINGFUL WAY POSSIBLE
4a6c0308 <NOISE> ONE OF THE STRONGEST ARGUMENTS THAT A GOVERNMENT PROGRAM IS WORTHWHILE OCCURS WHEN IT HAS A USER FEE AND THE FEE COVERS COSTS
4a6c0309 <NOISE> THE REVERSE IS ALSO TRUE AND THAT IS ONE REASON SOME *BENEFICIARIES* OPPOSE USER FEES
4a6c030a THE IMPROVED RESULTS STEM LARGELY FROM GOLD SALES AT THE COMPANY'S GOLD BAR OPERATIONS IN NEVADA WHERE PRODUCTION BEGAN IN JANUARY

4a6c030y WE HAVE EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THIS WILL ONLY BE TEMPORARY

4a6c0404 I'M NOT A BIG FIRM KIND OF GUY HE SAID
4a6c0405 I DON'T WANT TO LIVE BY CONSENSUS
4a6c0406 IN THE BEGINNING FAYROUZ SANG ABOUT ROMANTIC LOVE AND NOSTALGIA FOR VILLAGE LIFE
4a6c0407 NOW SHE SAYS I THINK I SING FOR ALL HUMAN FEELINGS AND EMOTIONS
4a6c0408 PEACE LOVE NOSTALGIA MAL DU PAYS AGAINST OPPRESSION
4a6c0409 HE TOOK THE TAG NUMBER OF THEIR CAR MR. CLIFTON RECALLED REFERRING TO MR. MCGEE
4a6c040a AND HE CAME AND GOT ME AND SAID HEY THIS IS THE REAL THING
4a6c040b IT'S NOT A FLUKE
4a6c040c IT APPEARS TO BE TRUE
4a6c040d BURLINGTON ALSO HAS BEEN MOVING AGGRESSIVELY IN COURT TO COUNTER THE HOSTILE BID
4a6c040e YESTERDAY IT FILED ITS SECOND LAWSUIT AGAINST THE GROUP AND DISCLOSED THAT IT MAY TURN THE TABLES AND SEEK TO ACQUIRE CONTROL OF MONTREAL BASED DOMINION
4a6c040f THE PAC MAN DEFENSE IS NAMED AFTER THE VIDEO GAME IN WHICH A PLAYER TRIES TO GOBBLE UP HIS FOE BEFORE THE PLAYER IS SWALLOWED
4a6c040g WHILE OTHER OPEC MEMBERS RECOGNIZE THE ADVANTAGE OF GOING DOWNSTREAM MOST LACK KUWAIT'S MONEY SMALL POPULATION AND ABILITY TO MOVE FAST
4a6c040h <NOISE> WE CAN'T ARGUE THAT STRONGLY FOR SPENDING BILLIONS ABROAD TO BUY DOWNSTREAM FACILITIES SAYS A VENEZUELAN OIL OFFICIAL
4a6c040i OUR PEOPLE ARE STILL HUNGRY AND OUR DOMESTIC ECONOMY NEEDS THE MONEY MORE
4a6c040j L. T. V. HAS SAID REPEATEDLY SINCE ITS FILING THAT IT WOULD FIGHT ANY CREDITOR MOVE TO EITHER REORGANIZE THE UNIT SEPARATELY OR FORCE ITS SALE
4a6c040k CREDITORS ON THE OTHER HAND HAVE DISCUSSED THE IDEA ALMOST SINCE THE DAY OF L. T. V.'S FILING
4a6c040l AND THE PENSION AGENCY THE BANKS AND THE COMMITTEE REPRESENTING UNSECURED CREDITORS HAVE RECENTLY BEEN HOLDING SERIOUS DISCUSSIONS ON THE ISSUE
4a6c040m <NOISE> SENATOR EXON HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MOST OUTSPOKEN PROPONENTS OF BLOCKING CERTAIN FOREIGN INVESTMENT
4a6c040n WHEN FUJITSU ANNOUNCED ITS PLANS TO TAKE OVER FAIRCHILD SEMICONDUCTOR CORPORATION LAST YEAR HE WAS QUICK TO COMPLAIN
4a6c040o FAIRCHILD ACCOUNTS FOR ONLY A SMALL FRACTION OF U. S. SEMICONDUCTOR PRODUCTION AND WAS ALREADY CONTROLLED BY SCHLUMBERGER CORPORATION A LARGELY FRENCH OWNED FIRM
4a6c040p NEVERTHELESS SENATOR EXON SAID THAT THE MERGER WOULD BE DETRIMENTAL TO THE NATIONAL SECURITY
4a6c040q HE ALSO QUESTIONED WHETHER OPEC PRODUCTION IS AS HIGH AS IT IS THOUGHT BY MANY TO BE
4a6c040r THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF SPECULATION AS TO WHAT THE ACTUAL LEVEL IS HE SAID
4a6c040s BUT HE ADDED I HOPE THAT THIS OVERPRODUCTION IS AN ABERRATION AND NOT A TREND
4a6c040t IN THE MILITARY OR IN ANY APPOINTED LEADERSHIP POSITION YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY BY THE JOB YOU HOLD HE SAYS
4a6c040u IN POLITICS WHETHER YOU'RE RUNNING FOR OFFICE SEEKING A CLAIM OR APPROBATION YOU'VE GOT TO DEAL WITH PEOPLE WHOM YOU WOULDN'T TOLERATE FOR THIRTY SECONDS
4a6c040v YOU HAVE TO LEARN TO TOLERATE FOOLS
4a6c040w WEDNESDAY JUNE TWENTY FOURTH THE SUMMER SUN HIGHLIGHTS THE HUNDREDS OF SMALL SHARDS OF GLASS LITTERING THE ASPHALT
4a6c040x THE DEBRIS IS A REMINDER OF THE TIME TWO YEARS AGO WHEN LAFEYETTE THREW A CHUNK OF GLASS THAT ACCIDENTALLY PUT OUT A FRIEND'S EYE
4a6c040y I GOT REAL MAD AT MYSELF HE MUMBLES
4a6c040z I THOUGHT OF PULLING MY EYE OUT
4a6c0410 THE PENTAGON PROPOSED INCREASING OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE ACCOUNTS BY TWO POINT FOUR PERCENT IN THE COMING FISCAL YEAR
4a6c0411 <NOISE> THESE PAY FOR TRAINING SHIP STEAMING HOURS AND THE COSTS OF KEEPING WEAPONS IN GOOD REPAIR
4a6c0412 MR. CARLUCCI EMPHASIZED THAT IT IS PREFERABLE TO KEEP A SMALLER FORCE THAT IS ADEQUATELY PAID AND READY TO FIGHT THAN TO HAVE A LARGER FORCE THAT ISN'T
4a6c0413 IT WOULD BE A DISASTER IF WE REPEAT THE EXPERIENCE OF THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES WHERE YOU KEEP THE FRAMEWORK BUT HOLLOW IT OUT HE SAID
4a6c0414 IN AFGHANISTAN HE ADDS PEOPLE HAVE STAYED IN THE ARMY BECAUSE THEY NEED TO FEED THEIR CHILDREN AND BECAUSE THEY WORRY ABOUT THEIR FAMILIES
4a6c0415 <NOISE> THEY JOIN OFFENSIVES BECAUSE THE SOVIETS ARE AT THEIR BACKS WITH GUNS
4a6c0416 NOW THAT THEY KNOW THEY HAVEN'T ANYONE EITHER TO PROTECT THEM OR THREATEN THEM IT WILL HAVE AN EFFECT ON MORALE
4a6c0417 BUT THIS RELIANCE ALSO RAISES THE STAKES IN THE FARMERS RACE
4a6c0418 THE WHOLE GROUP STRATEGY GOES OUT THE DOOR IF B. A. T. LOSES FARMERS SAYS PAUL BURKE AN ANALYST AT LONDON STOCKBROKERS KLEINWORT GRIEVESON SECURITIES
4a6c0419 AND YOU'RE PERCEIVED AS A LOSER WHICH YOU DON'T WANT TO BE IN AMERICA
4a6c041a THE NEWS SENT THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE ON A GIDDY RISE OF MORE THAN FIFTY POINTS
4a6c041b <NOISE> BUT INVESTORS MAY NEED TO BE SHOWN MORE
4a6c041c FRIDAY'S VOLUME AFTER SUBTRACTING A BIG DIVIDEND CAPTURE TRADE WAS ONLY MODERATE AT AROUND A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION SHARES
4a6c041d WHY THIS INCREDIBLE DIVERSION OF EFFORT TO CRIMES THAT OFTEN ARE NOT CLEARLY DEFINED BY STATUTE AND WHERE IDENTIFIABLE VICTIMS ARE SELDOM FOUND
4a6c041e MAYBE TOO MANY OF TODAY'S PROSECUTORS WERE INFLUENCED BY THE PREVAILING COUNTERCULTURE SUSPICIONS OF MIDDLE CLASS MORALITY DURING THEIR LAW SCHOOL DAYS
4a6c041f <NOISE> BUT ANOTHER ANSWER IS SIMPLER IT IS EASIER TO EXTRACT PLEA BARGAINS FROM TRADERS WITH A MERE MENTION OF R. I. C. O. THAN FROM REAL FELONS
4a7c0201 THE SALE OF THE HOTELS IS PART OF HOLIDAY'S STRATEGY TO SELL OFF ASSETS AND CONCENTRATE ON PROPERTY MANAGEMENT
4a7c0202 THE HOTEL OPERATOR'S EMBASSY SUITES HOTELS INCORPORATED SUBSIDIARY WILL CONTINUE TO MANAGE THE PROPERTIES
4a7c0203 LONG TERM MANAGEMENT CONTRACTS ALLOW US TO GENERATE INCOME ON A SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER CAPITAL BASE SAID MICHAEL D. ROSE HOLIDAY'S CHAIRMAN AND EXECUTIVE OFFICER
4a7c0204 BUT IT WILL TAKE A LOT OF ACQUISITIONS FOR SPECIALTY RETAILING TO HAVE MUCH EFFECT ON SEARS'S BOTTOM LINE
4a7c0205 SEARS'S MERCHANDISE GROUP ALONE GENERATED PROFIT OF SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE
4a7c0206 INDEED ANALYSTS SAY THAT IN THE PAST SEARS MAY HAVE BEEN HESITANT TO BUY SPECIALTY STORES BECAUSE THEY WON'T QUICKLY CONTRIBUTE TO PROFIT
4a7c0207 HOWEVER A SEARS SPOKESWOMAN SAID YESTERDAY THAT THE COMPANY DOESN'T HAVE ANY QUALIFICATIONS ABOUT HOW QUICKLY OR HOW MUCH SPECIALTY ACQUISITIONS WOULD HAVE TO CONTRIBUTE TO EARNINGS
4a7c0208 MR. ELLIOTT'S LIFE STYLE WAS LUXURIANT EVEN BY UPSCALE LOCAL STANDARDS
4a7c0209 BUT FAR FROM DRAWING SUSPICION HIS EXTRAVAGANCE WON HIM RESPECT
4a7c020a <NOISE> A ROLLS ROYCE CONVERTIBLE HEADED HIS FLEET OF CARS THREE MERCEDES TWO CADILLACS A CORVETTE AND A CLASSIC FORD THUNDERBIRD CONVERTIBLE
4a7c020b <NOISE> IN MATTEL'S CASE SOME ANALYSTS ADVISE WAITING OUT THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR WHILE THE COMPANY COMPLETES COST CUTTING MEASURES
4a7c020c ON MONDAY MATTEL SAID IT HAD LIMITED FOURTH QUARTER SHIPMENTS TO RETAILERS AND IT PROMISED FURTHER RETRENCHMENTS
4a7c020d <NOISE> IT ALREADY HAS ANNOUNCED LAYOFFS AMOUNTING TO FOURTEEN PERCENT OF ITS WORK FORCE
4a7c020e BUT EXXON CORPORATION AMOCO CORPORATION AND ATLANTIC RICHFIELD COMPANY POSTED HIGHER PROFIT
4a7c020f NEW YORK BASED EXXON THE NATION'S BIGGEST OIL COMPANY HAD THE SMALLEST PERCENTAGE INCREASE
4a7c020g ITS NET INCOME CLIMBED FIVE POINT ONE PERCENT EVEN THOUGH GAINS FROM ASSET SALES CONTRIBUTED THIRTY FOUR CENTS A SHARE TO YEAR EARLIER PROFIT
4a7c020h <NOISE> WHILE MR. *ARROYO* WORKED IN PRESIDENT AQUINO'S OFFICE AND SAW HER EVERY DAY MR. ONGPIN WAS STILL HALFWAY AROUND THE WORLD BARGAINING WITH THE BANKERS
4a7c020i TO CHEER ON HIS EXHAUSTED TEAM MEMBERS HE OUTFITTED THEM ONE DAY IN YELLOW NECKTIES THE COLOR OF THE AQUINO REVOLUTION
4a7c020j ON MARCH TWENTY SEVENTH MR. ONGPIN REACHED A DEAL
4a7c020k SEPARATELY THE LABOR DEPARTMENT SAID AVERAGE WEEKLY EARNINGS OF U. S. WORKERS FELL ZERO POINT THREE PERCENT IN MARCH AFTER ADJUSTING FOR INFLATION AND SEASONAL FACTORS
4a7c020l EARNINGS FELL A REVISED ZERO POINT FOUR PERCENT IN FEBRUARY
4a7c020m BEFORE INFLATION ADJUSTMENT AVERAGE HOURLY EARNINGS ROSE ZERO POINT SEVEN PERCENT BUT THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF HOURS WORKED EACH WEEK FELL ZERO POINT SIX PERCENT
4a7c020n <NOISE> IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX MY SON DIED FOLLOWING A SECOND LIVER TRANSPLANT
4a7c020o WE DONATED HIS CORNEAS AND I THANK GOD FOR THAT ONE POSITIVE RESULT FROM HIS DEATH
4a7c020p I KNOW OF MANY DONOR FAMILIES WHO HAVE HAD THE SAME POSITIVE EXPERIENCE
4a7c020q MR. SHORTELL AND DOCTOR HUGHES SAY PATIENT CARE MAY HAVE BEEN HURT BY COST CUTTING IN SEVERAL AREAS SUCH AS HOSPITAL'S SLASHING OF NURSING STAFFS
4a7c020r THAT VIEW IS SUPPORTED BY THE AMERICAN NURSING ASSOCIATION WHICH BLAMES COST CONTAINMENT FOR *EXACERBATING* THE CURRENT NURSING SHORTAGE
4a7c020s MANY HOSPITALS CUT BACK ON NURSES IN THE EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTIES AND HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO RAISE SALARIES ENOUGH TO LURE THEM BACK
4a7c020t INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS LOOKING FOR SOME EXCITEMENT IN THEIR LIVES AREN'T LIKELY TO BE ENTHRALLED BY MR. BERG'S ADVICE
4a7c020u HE SUGGESTS THAT THEY DROP THEIR HARD EARNED DOLLARS INTO THE MOST CONSERVATIVE INVESTMENTS T. BILLS AND SIT TIGHT
4a7c020v THERE'S NO SENSE TRYING TO PLAY GAMES WITH THIS MARKET MR. BERG EXPLAINS
4a7c020w GEORGE POPE ASSISTANT ADMINISTRATOR FOR EXPORT CREDITS THE DEPARTMENT'S FOREIGN AGRICULTURAL SERVICE SAID HE THINKS THE G. A. O.'S LOSS ESTIMATE IS OVERSTATED
4a7c020x <NOISE> WE DON'T RESCHEDULE LOANS UNLESS WE EXPECT TO BE REPAID HE SAID
4a7c020y <NOISE> WE EXPECT TO BE REPAID ON MOST OF THEM
4a7c020z MR. HARMON ESTIMATES THAT BETWEEN TEN PERCENT AND FIFTEEN PERCENT OF ZAYRE'S THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY EIGHT STORES WILL BE CLOSED IN THE REVAMPING
4a7c0210 MANY MORE STORES WILL BE REMODELED
4a7c0211 THE EFFORT WILL PARALLEL ONE ALREADY UNDER WAY AT ZAYRE
4a7c0212 THEIR PLAN IS THE RIGHT PLAN MR. HARMON SAID
4a7c0213 BUT IT WOULD HAVE MEANT A LOT OF EXPENSES AND A LOT OF LOSSES FOR A COMPANY ALREADY RACKED WITH LOSSES
4a7c0214 <NOISE> DESPITE YESTERDAY'S RUN UP TRADERS REMAINED SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE U. S. CURRENCY'S POTENTIAL TO CLIMB MUCH FURTHER
4a7c0215 THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS IT WILL COME OFF AGAIN PREDICTED REINHARD PFEIFFER CHIEF DEALER FOR D. G. BANK IN FRANKFURT
4a7c0216 I DON'T SEE THE DOLLAR AT ONE POINT NINE OH AGAIN
4a7c0217 IF THE CURRENCY CONTINUED TO RISE HE SAID HE EXPECTED THE BUNDESBANK TO INTERVENE AS EARLY AS TODAY IN FAR EASTERN MARKETS
4a7c0218 THEN MIKHAIL GORBACHEV AND WOJCIECH *JARUZELSKI* DECIDED TO CLEAR THE AIR
4a7c0219 TWO YEARS AGO THEY COMMISSIONED A PANEL OF HISTORIANS TO FILL IN THE BLANK SPOTS OF THE SOVIET POLISH PAST
4a7c021a *KATYN* LED THE AGENDA FOR THE PANEL'S POLES BUT THE SOVIET SIDE BALKED
4a7c021b DREDGING UP *KATYN* SAID ONE OF ITS MEMBERS WOULD ONLY FOMENT ANTI SOVIET SENTIMENT IN THE POLISH PUBLIC
4a7c021c ASHTON TATE HAS BEEN PLAGUED BY OPERATING LOSSES AND MANAGEMENT TURMOIL <NOISE>
4a7c021d LAST MONTH IT REPORTED A NINETEEN POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR SECOND QUARTER NET LOSS AS WELL AS THE RESIGNATION OF ITS PRESIDENT AND CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER
4a7c021e ONCE A SOFTWARE INDUSTRY STAR THE COMPANY HAS BEEN BUFFETED BY GROWING COMPETITION IN ITS CORE DATABASE BUSINESS
4a7c0301 PUBLISHING SO CALLED BLACKLIST BOOKS THAT ARE KEPT IN PRINT FOR YEARS ON END HAS SOME ADVANTAGES OVER PUBLISHING BEST SELLERS
4a7c0302 A GOOD FISHING BOOK WILL NEVER MATCH A JACKIE COLLINS NOVEL IN TOTAL SALES
4a7c0303 <NOISE> BUT IT WILL OUTLIVE HER RACY FICTION WITH ITS FICKLE READERS
4a7c0304 PUBLISHERS WILL DUMP MOST OF THIS YEAR'S BEST SELLERS ON REMAINDER TABLES NEXT YEAR WHERE THEY MAY FETCH AS LITTLE AS A DOLLAR APIECE
4a7c0305 KELLOGG SAID SHAREHOLDERS VOTED AGAINST DIVESTITURE OF ITS CEREAL MANUFACTURING PLANT NEAR JOHANNESBURG
4a7c0306 THE PLANT EMPLOYS THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY PEOPLE INCLUDING TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY BLACKS
4a7c0307 KELLOGG'S OPERATION THERE ACCOUNTS FOR LESS THAN ONE PERCENT OF THE COMPANY'S ANNUAL SALES OF THREE POINT THIRTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS
4a7c0308 THE LOAN IS PART OF A SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR PLAN TO EXPAND THE MINE'S RESERVES AND ALLOW IT TO KEEP OPERATING UNTIL NINETEEN NINETY FOUR
4a7c0309 WITHOUT THE EXPANSION THE MINE WAS THREATENED WITH CLOSURE NEXT YEAR
4a7c030a CLOSURE WOULD MEAN THE LOSS OF SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN JOBS <NOISE>
4a7c030b IN THE CAREFREE DAYS BEFORE DEREGULATION IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT FIVE BIG AIRLINES HANDLED MOST OF THE PASSENGER TRAFFIC IN AND OUT OF LAMBERT SAINT
4a7c030c LOUIS INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT
4a7c030d THEN CAME THE AIR WARS
4a7c030e AFTER DECONTROL NINE MORE AIRLINES INVADED THE MARKET ALL TRYING TO LURE A SHARE OF THE TWENTY MILLION TRAVELERS WHO USE THIS AIRPORT EACH YEAR
4a7c030f HUMANA TRIED TO DEFEND ITSELF THROUGH DIVERSIFICATION AS DID THE OTHER LARGE CHAINS HOSPITAL CORPORATION OF AMERICA AMERICAN MEDICAL INTERNATIONAL INCORPORATED AND NATIONAL MEDICAL ENTERPRISES INCORPORATED
4a7c030g THE IDEA WAS THAT IF A HOSPITAL OWNER ALSO HAD AN INSURANCE PLAN IT COULD STEER PATIENTS TO ITS INSTITUTIONS THROUGH FINANCIAL INCENTIVES
4a7c030h THE PATIENT POOL MIGHT SHRINK BUT THE COMPANY COULD GRAB A BIGGER PART OF IT
4a7c030i CERTAINLY GOVERNMENT CONTROLLED TELEVISION HAS HAD A ROLE IN THAT TRANSFORMATION
4a7c030j MR. ROH'S STRATEGISTS SAY KOREANS HAVE TEN TIMES MORE TELEVISION SETS SOME TEN MILLION <NOISE> THAN IN THE LAST PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS IN NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE
4a7c030k THUS A RECENT KIM YOUNG SAM RALLY THAT ATTRACTED A CROWD OF ONE MILLION AT HIS HOME TOWN OF PUSAN WAS A SECONDARY NEWS ITEM ON THE NIGHTLY NEWS <NOISE>
4a7c030l SEVERAL SMALLER PARTY MEETINGS ATTENDED BY MR. ROH LED THE BROADCAST
4a7c030m I. N. F. ALSO REMOVES U. S. GROUND LAUNCHED CRUISE MISSILES FROM EUROPE BUT WHAT ABOUT AIR LAUNCHED OR SEA LAUNCHED CRUISES
4a7c030n SINCE THE GUIDANCE SYSTEMS ARE SIMILAR IN ALL THREE TYPES ARE WE ALSO BANNED FROM PROVIDING THEM TO OUR ALLIES
4a7c030o CRUISES ARE ESSENTIAL OF COURSE BECAUSE THEY CAN CARRY CONVENTIONAL WARHEADS AND THUS DEFEND EUROPE WITHOUT THREATENING A NUCLEAR EXCHANGE
4a7c030p BUT THE U. S. GAVE UP ALL GROUND LAUNCHED CRUISES AS PART OF THE I. N. F. BECAUSE WE SAID IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN NUCLEAR AND CONVENTIONAL
4a7c030q AND ON MONDAY SENATOR JOE BIDEN ALREADY WAS ARGUING THAT THE SAME LOGIC SHOULD APPLY TO AIR LAUNCHED OR SEA LAUNCHED CRUISES IN THE START TALKS
4a7c030r ESPRIT IS NOW A LEANER COMPANY THAT OPERATES MORE CONVENTIONALLY
4a7c030s ACCORDING TO MR. *FEDERICO* THE OPERATIONS CHIEF EACH DIVISION NOW HAS A BUDGET TO FOLLOW FOR THE FIRST TIME
4a7c030t THE NEW EXECUTIVES IN ESPRIT'S SENIOR MANAGEMENT INCLUDING VETERANS FROM CALVIN KLEIN AND IZOD LACOSTE HAVE TIGHTENED MARKETING AND QUALITY CONTROLS
4a7c030u <NOISE> OFFICERS FOR MAJOR DEPARTMENT STORES SAY ESPRIT IS KEEPING CLOSER TRACK OF SALES AND OFFERING CLOTHES MORE IN TUNE WITH TODAY'S TASTES
4a7c030v CANADA JAPAN AND WEST GERMANY REQUIRE GOOD WILL TO BE AMORTIZED AGAINST EARNINGS
4a7c030w HOWEVER THE GOOD WILL CHARGES ARE IN LARGE MEASURE TAX DEDUCTIBLE WHICH GIVES COMPANIES FROM THESE COUNTRIES A CASH FLOW ADVANTAGE OVER A U. S. PURCHASER
4a7c030x IN EFFECT THE GOVERNMENTS OF JAPAN GERMANY AND CANADA PROVIDE A SUBSIDY FOR THE PURCHASE OF U. S. COMPANIES
4a7c030y THE NINE HUNDRED MEMBER SHAREHOLDER GROUP SAID IT FILED THE SUIT IN OAKLAND COUNTY MICHIGAN
4a7c030z CIRCUIT COURT TO RECEIVE PAYMENT OF THE STOCK'S FULL MARKET VALUE

4a7c0312 AMFAC BASED HERE IS A MAJOR OWNER OF PROPERTY IN HAWAII AND HAS INTERESTS IN WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTION FOOD PROCESSING RETAILING AGRICULTURE AND RESORTS
4a7c0313 THE COMPANY DECLINED FURTHER COMMENT PENDING RELEASE OF THE PROXY MATERIALS
4a7c0314 FOR EXAMPLE THREE YEAR TREASURY NOTES AS OF LATE YESTERDAY YIELDED ABOUT EIGHT POINT SIXTY NINE PERCENT
4a7c0315 THAT'S LESS THAN A THIRD OF A PERCENTAGE POINT BELOW THE APPROXIMATELY NINE PERCENT YIELD AVAILABLE ON THIRTY YEAR TREASURY BONDS
4a7c0316 I DON'T THINK THERE'S ENOUGH INCENTIVE TO INVESTORS TO REACH OUT AND BUY LONG TERM TREASURYS <NOISE> AT NINE PERCENT MR. FOEHLICH SAID
4a7c0317 ORIGINALLY HOME SHOPPING HAD SUED G. T. E. FOR ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN DAMAGES FOR ALLEGEDLY PROVIDING A GROSSLY INACCURATE PHONE SYSTEM FOR THE HOME SHOPPING OPERATION
4a7c0318 <NOISE> G. T. E. FILED A COUNTERCLAIM ALLEGING THAT HOME SHOPPING'S SUIT WAS A SHAM DESIGNED TO PASS THE BUCK FOR HOME SHOPPING'S OWN TROUBLES
4a7c0319 THE JURY SIDED WITH G. T. E. AND RETURNED A TEN MILLION DOLLAR VERDICT
4a7c031a HOME SHOPPING HAS SAID IT WOULD APPEAL

4a7c031c WE AREN'T PICKING ON ANY PARTICULAR MANUFACTURER SAID IRENE CARO ACTING F. D. A. DISTRICT DIRECTOR IN LOS ANGELES

4a7c031g SOURCE FULTON PREBON U. S. A. INCORPORATED
4a7c0401 STATES ARE GETTING SERIOUS ABOUT WELFARE REFORM BECAUSE THEY CAN NO LONGER AFFORD TO SUBSIDIZE A PERCENTAGE OF THEIR RESIDENTS IN PERPETUITY
4a7c0402 A GROWING BODY OF EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT INCREASED WELFARE SPENDING WILL NOT MAKE A DENT IN POVERTY
4a7c0403 TO THE CONTRARY THE SPENDING MAY ACTUALLY HAVE CONSEQUENCES SUCH AS FAMILY DISSOLUTION ILLEGITIMATE BIRTHS AND CHRONIC UNEMPLOYMENT
4a7c0404 MORE ENLIGHTENED WELFARE POLICY MUST ABATE NOT *EXACERBATE* THESE PROBLEMS
4a7c0405 AFTER U. S. WARPLANES STRUCK LIBYA LAST APRIL RICHARD ROBINSON DROPPED PLANS FOR A TWO WEEK VACATION IN FRANCE AND IRELAND FEARING AN INCREASE IN TERRORISM
4a7c0406 NOW MR. ROBINSON A DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT INCORPORATED STOCKBROKER IN BOCA RATON FLORIDA PLANS TO VISIT WEST GERMANY THIS JUNE
4a7c0407 BUT IF THEY START THE TERRORISM AGAIN I'LL HAVE TO RECONSIDER HE SAYS
4a7c0408 FOR HALF A CENTURY OR LONGER REGULATORS HAVE PURSUED RATE BASED REGULATION
4a7c0409 UNDER THAT APPROACH THEY DECIDED WHAT THE RETURN ON EQUITY SHOULD BE FOR THE PHONE COMPANIES AND EXPENSES WERE THEN ESTIMATED
4a7c040a REGULATORS THEN COULD DETERMINE THE REVENUE THE PHONE COMPANY NEEDED TO COLLECT TO EARN ITS ALLOWED RATE OF RETURN
4a7c040b THE DRUG *AZIDOTHYMIDINE* OR A. Z. T. IS THE FIRST PRESCRIPTION DRUG FOR ACQUIRED IMMUNE DEFICIENCY SYNDROME TO GET FEDERAL FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION APPROVAL
4a7c040c A. Z. T. IS MARKETED UNDER THE NAME RETROVIR BY BURROUGHS WELLCOME COMPANY AT AN ANNUAL RETAIL DOSAGE COST OF ABOUT TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS
4a7c040d IT ALSO IS THE MOST EXPENSIVE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PROMOTING FEARS THAT SOME INSURERS WHO NORMALLY PROVIDE PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE WILL BALK AT ITS PRICE
4a7c040e CRITICS SAY THE THAI ROUTES ARE BLEEDING THE AIRLINE DRY AND WON'T EVER BE PROFITABLE
4a7c040f AND A HONG KONG ANALYST SAYS DRAGONAIR MISSED A BIG CHANCE TO IMPROVE ON ITS CHINA TRADE VIRTUALLY AT THE CARRIER'S INCEPTION

4a7c040q HE SAYS THAT HE HAS COOPERATED IN AN INQUIRY BY FLORIDA OFFICIALS BUT THAT HE ISN'T AWARE THE MATTER HAS BEEN REFERRED TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE
4a7c040r IN ANY CASE HE SAYS SPORT ABOUT'S PROBLEMS WILL BE CURED BY THE PUBLIC OFFERING AND ARE COMMONPLACE IN ANY RAPIDLY GROWING FRANCHISE BUSINESS
4a7c040s BUT MANY CLUBS DON'T OFFER TEAM SPORTS AT ALL
4a7c040t THIS REFLECTS A GERMANIC DISTASTE FOR THE IDEA OF COMPETITION AS A GOAL IN ITSELF AND FOR THE AMERICAN PENCHANT FOR TURNING PRACTICALLY EVERYTHING INTO A CONTEST
4a7c040u BEAUTY PAGEANTS ARE RARE HERE HOSTILE TAKEOVERS ARE UNKNOWN IN THE BUSINESS WORLD AND THE GOVERNMENT STILL FIXES PRICES ON MANY PRODUCTS AND STRICTLY REGULATES STORE HOURS
4a7c040v YOU THINK THAT'S WEIRD
4a7c040w THINK AGAIN
4a7c040x HE'S NOT ALONE

4a7c0411 BUT THE BUSH FAMILY AS A WHOLE GETS HIGH MARKS ON THE STUMP
4a7c0412 AFTER MR. BUSH LOST TO KANSAS SENATOR ROBERT DOLE IN THE IOWA CAUCUS THE FAMILY RUSHED TO HIS RESCUE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE
4a7c0413 THEY HAD BURIED GEORGE BUSH IN THE PRESS RECALLS FORTY TWO YEAR OLD GEORGE BUSH JUNIOR
4a7c0414 IT WAS TIME TO RESURRECT HIM
4a7c0415 WE GIVE A LOOK LIKE A GENERATION BEFORE THEM LIVED HERE SAYS MR. MARDER
4a7c0416 THAT'S WORTH MONEY
4a7c0417 IN THE PAST THREE YEARS ALONE THE COMPANY HAS DOUBLED ITS PROFITS AND TRIPLED ITS STAFF HE ADDS
4a7c0418 SALES ARE STILL UNDER TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR HE SAYS BUT THEY'RE HEADED UP
4a7c0419 IT'S KIND OF LIKE EATING PEANUTS ISN'T IT SAID MR. MURPHY
4a7c041a ONCE YOU START IT'S TOUGH TO STOP
4a7c041b THE UMPTEENTH SOUNDS OF LEAD SMACKING METAL AND A RIFLE BEING COCKED SERVED AS A QUICK ANSWER TO HIS QUESTION
4a7c041c SO WHAT IS WALL STREET TELLING THE QUEASY INVESTORS THAT HOLD SHARES IN GENERIC DRUG MAKERS
4a7c041d IN ESSENCE DON'T WORRY
4a7c041e TAKE TWO ASPIRIN AND CALL ME IN A FEW YEARS
4a8c0201 THE SPOKESWOMAN DECLINED TO IDENTIFY POSSIBLE USES FOR THE COMPANY'S CASH OTHER THAN THE STOCK BUYBACK
4a8c0202 BUT GARY SCHNEIDER ANALYST WITH BEAR STEARNS AND COMPANY SAID HE EXPECTS THE COMPANY TO EXTEND THE BUYBACK BEYOND FOUR MILLION SHARES
4a8c0203 HE ESTIMATED THE COMPANY'S BREAKUP VALUE AT *SEVENTY* DOLLARS A SHARE
4a8c0204 HERE ARE PRICE TRENDS ON THE WORLD'S MAJOR STOCK MARKETS AS CALCULATED BY MORGAN STANLEY CAPITAL INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE GENEVA
4a8c0205 TO MAKE THEM DIRECTLY COMPARABLE EACH INDEX IS BASED ON THE CLOSE OF NINETEEN SIXTY NINE EQUALING ONE HUNDRED
4a8c0206 THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE IS SINCE YEAR END
4a8c0207 <NOISE> MR. BERGER CLAIMS THE PROBLEM GOES BEYOND SIMPLY RECOVERING THE COST OF IMPROVEMENTS
4a8c0208 BECAUSE THE LOFT'S BOARD'S REIMBURSEMENT ALLOWANCES ARE SO LOW HE SAYS BANKS WON'T MAKE LOANS FOR THE WORK
4a8c0209 HE SAYS HE FINANCED HIS IMPROVEMENTS BY TAKING A SECOND MORTGAGE ON ANOTHER BUILDING THAT HE OWNS
4a8c020a THE BOTTOM LINE HE SAYS IS THAT THESE BUILDINGS CANNOT BE MADE SAFE UNDER THESE RULES
4a8c020b THE JOB WILL NOT GET DONE
4a8c020c BOND PRICES STILL ARE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THEY WERE BEFORE PRESIDENT REAGAN'S SURPRISE ANNOUNCEMENT TUESDAY MORNING THAT ALAN GREENSPAN WILL REPLACE PAUL VOLCKER AS CHAIRMAN OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD
4a8c020d FOR EXAMPLE THE SHEARSON LEHMAN INDEX PLUMMETED ABOUT FORTY POINTS TUESDAY AND REGAINED ABOUT TWENTY FIVE POINTS SINCE THEN
4a8c020e THE LATEST THIRTY YEAR TREASURY BOND WHICH NOW YIELDS EIGHT POINT SEVEN THREE PERCENT STOOD AT EIGHT POINT SIX TWO PERCENT LATE MONDAY
4a8c020f JUDGE THEM ON THEIR PERSONALITY JUDGE THEM ON ANYTHING YOU WANT THE MASTER OF CEREMONIES TELLS THE CROWD
4a8c020g THIS IS SERIOUS STUFF HERE SAYS TOM SCHREYER TWENTY FOUR ADMIRING ONE CONTESTANT

4a8c020k MR. CAPPY AND CHRYSLER EXECUTIVES SAID THEY STILL DON'T KNOW HOW MANY A. M. C. WORKERS WILL ULTIMATELY LOSE THEIR JOBS
4a8c020l <NOISE> U. S. UTILITIES COULD ALSO INCREASE ORDERS OF FOREIGN URANIUM AHEAD OF ANY TOTAL IMPORT RESTRICTIONS ANALYSTS SAY
4a8c020m <NOISE> URANIUM FROM SOUTH AFRICA FOR EXAMPLE HAS ALREADY FALLEN UNDER ANTI *APARTHEID* SANCTIONS
4a8c020n BUT LAST YEAR SAID THE URANIUM INSTITUTE U. S. IMPORTS OF SOUTH AFRICAN URANIUM SURGED THREE HUNDRED PERCENT TO MORE THAN THIRTEEN POINT TWO MILLION POUNDS
4a8c020o ALMOST SIXTY PERCENT OF THE DELIVERIES TOOK PLACE IN DECEMBER NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX THE LAST MONTH BEFORE THE EMBARGO TOOK EFFECT
4a8c020p ON THE SUBJECT OF COMPUTER RESERVATIONS SYSTEMS YOU HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD
4a8c020q <NOISE> THE NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR RULES GOVERNING THE OPERATION OF C. R. S. SYSTEMS LED TO PUBLICATION OF UNREALISTIC SCHEDULES BY THE AIRLINES TO GET BETTER SCREEN POSITIONS
4a8c020r THIS RESULTED IN MORE DELAYS AND A LOT OF PASSENGER FRUSTRATION

4a8c0411 SO FAR WE'VE FOUND THAT FEDERAL EMPLOYEES HAVE DEALT WITH THIS ISSUE <NOISE> WITH A GREAT DEAL OF SENSITIVITY AND COMMON SENSE

4a8c041c HE WAS ABLE TO STAY IN GROOVE LONGER THAN ANY PITCHER I'VE SEEN

4a9c020s LAST DECEMBER THE U. N. DIDN'T ATTEMPT TO SOLICIT BIDS
4a9c020t IT SIMPLY EXTENDED ITS CONTRACT WITH NATIONAL CARTING
4a9c020u SOLICITING BIDS IN THIS PARTICULAR INDUSTRY IS NOT THE WAY TO GO A U. N. SPOKESMAN SAYS IMPLYING THAT IT IS FUTILE
4a9c020v THE IMPACT WILL BE ENORMOUS
4a9c020w THE REPUBLICANS' STRONGEST CASE AGAINST THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE HIS NAIVETE ON NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUES WILL DISAPPEAR
4a9c020x THE SUSPICION OF A SELECTION BASED ENTIRELY ON POLITICAL INSTEAD OF SUBSTANTIVE GROUNDS WILL BE UNDERCUT

4a9c0213 BROKERS AT MERRILL LYNCH REALTY RECALL A SALE THAT WAS DELAYED FOR A MONTH BY A ONE MILLION DOLLAR INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE LIEN ON THE PROPERTY
4a9c0214 ANOTHER SALE WAS DELAYED WHEN THE LENDER DISCOVERED THAT THE OWNER HAD DIED BETWEEN THE TIME THE PROPERTY WAS POSTED FOR FORECLOSURE AND THE FORECLOSURE WAS COMPLETED
4a9c0215 <NOISE> WE WERE AT THE CLOSING TABLE WHEN THIS ALL CAME OUT SAYS WANDA HUTCHINS THE MERRILL LYNCH AGENT
4a9c0216 INVALID FORECLOSURES ARE ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS WE HAVE
4a9c0217 MR. SMILOW SAID THAT THE COMPANY WON'T HAVE TO SELL ANY ADDITIONAL ASSETS TO FINANCE A NEW BUY OUT
4a9c0218 BUT IT WILL HAVE A LOT MORE DEBT THAN IT HAD PREVIOUSLY

4a9c021f THE FIRM HAD STATE OF THE ART COMPLIANCE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES IN EFFECT AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT MR. PEDOWITZ SAYS
4a9c021g I DON'T BELIEVE THEY WERE IN ANY RESPECT INADEQUATE
4a9c021h THERE ARE OBVIOUSLY SOME THINGS NO COMPLIANCE DEPARTMENT CAN PICK UP
4a9c0301 AND THE COMMISSION IS ATTEMPTING TO ENSURE THAT THE WEAKER DOLLAR DOESN'T KEEP AMERICANS AWAY
4a9c0302 WE'RE TRYING TO URGE THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY TO STABILIZE PRICES SO THAT THEY DON'T FLUCTUATE AS MUCH AS THE DOLLAR SAYS SPOKESMAN NEIL MARTIN
4a9c0303 EVEN SO SOME PRICES THOSE FOR MANY LUXURY HOTELS IN ITALY AND FRANCE FOR EXAMPLE HAVE BEEN SOARING

4a9c030a THE LOAN IS PART OF A SEVEN MILLION DOLLAR PLAN TO EXPAND THE MINE'S RESERVES AND ALLOW IT TO KEEP OPERATING UNTIL NINETEEN NINETY FOUR
4a9c030b WITHOUT THE EXPANSION THE MINE WAS THREATENED WITH CLOSURE NEXT YEAR
4a9c030c CLOSURE WOULD MEAN THE LOSS OF SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTEEN JOBS
4a9c030d COSTS ARE ANOTHER PROBLEM
4a9c030e DOCTOR RESNICK SAYS ULTRASOUND SCREENINGS FOR PROSTATE CANCER CAN COST UP TO THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS COMPARED TO TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS FOR A TRADITIONAL PROSTATE EXAM
4a9c030f ALSO HE SAYS THE ULTRASOUND PROCEDURE TAKES FIFTEEN TO THIRTY MINUTES COMPARED WITH FIVE MINUTES FOR THE TRADITIONAL METHOD
4a9c030g ALTHOUGH SUBSTANTIAL NEW TAXES ARE UNLIKELY THIS YEAR THE CURRENT DEBATE IS IMPORTANT
4a9c030h DEMOCRATS LIKE HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER JAMES WRIGHT AND MAJORITY WHIP TONY COELHO BELIEVE THEY CAN CONVINCE AMERICANS THAT PRESIDENT REAGAN HAS BEEN TOO KIND TO THE RICH

4a9c0404 SEVERAL FACTORS CONTRIBUTE TO BRITISH INVESTORS' REGARD FOR THESE SERVICE COMPANIES
4a9c0405 U. S. AND BRITISH ACCOUNTING STANDARDS DIFFER FOR THE GOOD WILL ARISING FROM ACQUISITIONS YIELDING HIGHER REPORTED EARNINGS FOR BRITISH COMPANIES
4a9c0406 SOME ANALYSTS SUGGEST U. K. INVESTORS HAVE FEW HIGH GROWTH INDUSTRIES TO CHOOSE FROM AND SO LOOK FAVORABLY ON SERVICE COMPANIES
4a9c0407 THAT LEAVES RETAIL BROKERAGE FIRMS WITH A STARK CHOICE
4a9c0408 THEY CAN MOVE ONTO THE INSTITUTIONAL FIRMS' TURF AND FIGHT FOR A TOP SPOT IN INVESTMENT BANKING
4a9c0409 OR THEY CAN SETTLE ONTO THE SECOND RANK OF THE SECURITIES BUSINESS PERHAPS FOREVER
4a9c040a ASSETS OF TWO HUNDRED GENERAL PURPOSE FUNDS ROSE ONE POINT ONE FIVE BILLION DOLLARS TO SEVENTY POINT THREE SIX BILLION DOLLARS
4a9c040b ASSETS OF NINETY THREE BROKER DEALER FUNDS FELL THREE HUNDRED SIXTY ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS TO ONE HUNDRED EIGHT POINT ZERO ONE BILLION DOLLARS
4a9c040c ASSETS OF ONE HUNDRED THREE INSTITUTIONAL FUNDS FELL FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY ONE POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS TO SIXTY SIX POINT ONE THREE BILLION DOLLARS
4a9c040d THE RIVALS HAVE DISPUTED EACH OTHER'S CIRCULATION CLAIMS FOR YEARS
4a9c040e ACCORDING TO RECENT INDUSTRY STATISTICS THE POST'S DAILY CIRCULATION IS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND THE CHRONICLE'S APPROXIMATES FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND
4a9c040f THE POST CLAIMS TO HAVE ROUGHLY FORTY PERCENT OF THE HOUSTON ADVERTISING MARKET
4a9c040g YOU DIDN'T HAVE PEOPLE HITTING THE SILKS ON THIS SAID JOHN KEEFE AN ANALYST FOR DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT INC. NEW YORK
4a9c040h YOU HAD TO EXPECT HIGHER REDEMPTIONS GIVEN ALL THE DIFFICULTY IN THE MARKET
4a9c040i BUT IT WAS CONTAINED FAIRLY WELL
4a9c040j THE PURCHASING MANAGERS SOUNDED MORE OPTIMISTIC THAN MOST ECONOMISTS IN SEVERAL RECENT SURVEYS
4a9c040k MANY ECONOMISTS FEAR THE STOCK MARKET'S COLLAPSE ON OCTOBER NINETEENTH WILL MAKE SHOPPERS MORE CAUTIOUS ESPECIALLY ON SUCH MAJOR PURCHASES AS AUTOS AND HOMES
4a9c040l SOME ALSO FEAR THE STOCK MARKET'S WOES MAY PERSUADE COMPANIES TO POSTPONE CAPITAL SPENDING PLANS UNTIL A CLEARER PICTURE OF THE ECONOMY'S HEALTH EMERGES
4a9c040m NEVERTHELESS MOST ECONOMISTS STILL CONTEND THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF A RECESSION COMING ANYTIME SOON
4a9c040n <NOISE> TO PUNISH CURRENCY SPECULATORS THE GOVERNMENT IS ALLOWING PEOPLE TO EXCHANGE A MAXIMUM OF TEN MILLION OLD CORDOBAS
4a9c040o ANYTHING OVER THAT CAN'T BE EXCHANGED BUT MUST BE DEPOSITED IN A BANK ACCOUNT
4a9c040p THE MOVES TOOK EFFECT YESTERDAY
4a9c040q TODAY'S GAMES RELY ON COMPUTER GENERATED IMAGES
4a9c040r AS COMPUTER CHIPS HAVE BECOME MORE POWERFUL THE IMAGES HAVE BECOME MORE COMPLICATED AND VIVID BUT STILL AREN'T REALISTIC
4a9c040s UNDER DEVELOPMENT HOWEVER ARE GAMES IN WHICH THE PLAYERS INTERACT WITH VIDEOTAPE SCENES
4a9c040t THE JAPANESE FIRMS INCLUDING OURSELVES HAVE BEEN GOOD MEMBERS OF THE PRIMARY DEALER COMMUNITY SAID TOSHIO MORI CHAIRMAN OF NIKKO'S U. S. UNIT
4a9c040u WE ARE NOT A DISTURBING FORCE IN THIS MARKET AND I DON'T SEE ANY ADVANTAGE IN KICKING THREE JAPANESE FIRMS OUT FROM BEING PRIMARY DEALERS
4a9c040v WHAT IS THE ADVANTAGE FOR U. S. MARKETS AND THE U. S. ECONOMY
4a9c040w EQUICOR WAS LAUNCHED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX BY EQUITABLE AND HOSPITAL CORPORATION TO PROVIDE EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PROGRAMS AND TO MANAGE HEALTH CARE PRODUCTS FOR CORPORATIONS
4a9c040x AFTER POSTING TWO YEARS OF LOSSES IT BROKE EVEN IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF THIS YEAR
4a9c040y EXECUTIVES OF BOTH EQUITABLE AND HOSPITAL CORPORATION SAID THEY EXPECT THE VENTURE TO BE PROFITABLE THIS YEAR
4a9c040z ESTIMATES OF THE MAKEUP OF THE FEEDLOT POPULATION VARY WIDELY
4a9c0410 MOST ANALYSTS EXPECT THE GOVERNMENT TO REPORT THAT THE NUMBER OF YOUNG CATTLE PLACED ON FEEDLOTS FELL IN JULY FOR THE SECOND CONSECUTIVE MONTH FROM A YEAR EARLIER
4a9c0411 HOWEVER SOME EXPECT A RISE
4a9c0412 IN ANY CASE A RETURN TO MARKET DISCIPLINE IS INEVITABLE
4a9c0413 FINANCIAL HISTORY HAS WITNESSED A THOUSAND BOOMS AND BUSTS
4a9c0414 WITHIN RECENT MEMORY WE HAVE SEEN THE JUNK EQUITIES OF THE SIXTIES THE HEATED THIRD WORLD LENDING OF THE SEVENTIES AND THE THRIFT CRISIS OF THE EIGHTIES
4a9c0415 THESE PROBLEMS OF THE RECENT PAST PALE IN SCOPE NEXT TO THE PERVASIVENESS AND TOTAL DOLLARS INVOLVED IN THE CURRENT CRAZE
4a9c0416 IF THE PARTICIPANTS IN THIS CRAZE AWAKEN NOW THE CORRECTION MAY STILL BE WITHIN TOLERABLE LIMITS FOR THE COUNTRY
4a9c0417 IF NOT ALL OF AMERICA WILL PAY THE PENALTY BECAUSE THE DEBT IS HUGE AND WIDELY HELD AND THE BANKING STRUCTURE'S INTEGRITY WOULD BE AT STAKE
4a9c0418 ONE STUMBLING BLOCK TO INCREASED COMPETITION IS THE VERTICAL INTEGRATION AND CROSS OWNERSHIP IN THE INDUSTRY
4a9c0419 CABLE SYSTEMS OFTEN HAVE DEMANDED A STAKE IN THE CHANNELS THEY TRANSMIT
4a9c041a <NOISE> AN ENTREPRENEUR IS RELUCTANT TO START AN ALTERNATIVE CABLE SYSTEM IF HE KNOWS HE WILL FIND IT DIFFICULT TO GAIN ACCESS TO PROGRAMMING
4a9c041b QUITE POSSIBLY SOME OF THE ANTITRUST ASPECTS OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS DESERVE A LOOK SO IT CAN BE -(DE)TERMINED WHETHER THEY ACT TO FURTHER INHIBIT COMPETITION IN THE INDUSTRY
4aac0201 MR. DAVIDOFF COULDN'T BE REACHED FOR COMMENT
4aac0202 HIS LAWYER PAUL ROONEY SAID MR.
4aac0203 DAVIDOFF DEEPLY REGRETS HIS INVOLVEMENT IN THE BOESKY COMPANY'S FAILURE TO REMAIN AT ALL TIMES IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION'S NET CAPITAL RULES
4aac0204 MR. ROONEY EMPHASIZED THAT MR. DAVIDOFF WASN'T CHARGED WITH INSIDER TRADING
4aac0205 WILLFUL VIOLATION OF THE CAPITAL RULE CARRIES A MAXIMUM PENALTY OF FIVE YEARS IN PRISON AND A TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR FINE
4aac0206 STOCK EXCHANGES COMMODITY MARKETS MANY BANKS AND SOME BUSINESSES WILL BE CLOSED IN THE U. S. MONDAY IN OBSERVANCE OF WASHINGTON'S BIRTHDAY
4aac0207 FEDERAL OFFICES WILL BE CLOSED AND THERE WON'T BE ANY REGULAR MAIL DELIVERIES
4aac0208 <NOISE> MANY STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICES ALSO WILL BE CLOSED
4aac0209 THEY HAVE PUT IN A LOT OF MONEY BUT IS THAT ENOUGH
4aac020a NOBODY KNOWS SAID MR. BRAY
4aac020b IN OCTOBER WE THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE ENOUGH BUT BETWEEN OCTOBER AND NOW IT'S PROVEN TO BE NOT ENOUGH
4aac020c WHO KNOWS HOW MUCH IT WILL BE
4aac020d PUROLATOR JUMPED FIVE AND A HALF TO FORTY AND THREE EIGHTHS
4aac020e EMERY AIR FREIGHT BEGAN A FORTY DOLLAR A SHARE TENDER OFFER FOR EIGHTY THREE PERCENT OF PUROLATOR'S COMMON
4aac020f EMERY ROSE SEVEN EIGHTHS TO THIRTEEN AND ONE HALF
4aac020g NOW THE ISSUE IS IN THE HOUSE'S LAP
4aac020h THE TEMPORARY BAN ON NEW BANKING POWERS IS A PROVISION IN THE SENATE VERSION OF A BILL TO RECAPITALIZE THE INSOLVENT FEDERAL SAVINGS AND LOAN INSURANCE CORP.
4aac020i THE HOUSE F. S. L. I. C. MEASURE DOESN'T HAVE ANY OTHER PROVISIONS
4aac020j MITSUBISHI HAS AN INFLUENTIAL NAME WHICH IS ONE REASON FOR THE REPUTATION DEALERS SAID
4aac020k BUT IT ALSO BENEFITED FROM HAVING LAUNCHED THE BONDS JUST AHEAD OF A NUMBER OF SCHEDULED DEALS BY OTHER JAPANESE BANKS GETTING INTO THE MARKET BEFORE OVERCROWDING TAKES PLACE
4aac020l BECAUSE THE BANK CONVERTIBLES GENERALLY APPEAL TO A MORE CONSERVATIVE MARKET SEGMENT THEY HAVEN'T BEEN AFFECTED BY THE PROBLEMS OF THE EQUITY WARRANT SECTOR
4aac020m TO DO THE JOB S. C. I. HAS ASSEMBLED WHAT ANALYSTS CALL A CRACK MANAGEMENT TEAM
4aac020n PRESIDENT EUGENE SAPP RUNS THE COMPANY ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS AND HE DOES SO IN A NO FRILLS ATMOSPHERE
4aac020o FOR EXAMPLE COMPANY CARS PLANES AND COUNTRY CLUB MEMBERSHIPS ARE TABOO
4aac020p MR. PATRICK AND ANYONE ELSE GIVING THE MATTER SERIOUS THOUGHT KNOWS THAT REGULATORY BODIES CAN'T MANAGE ENTERPRISES HARD AS THEY TRY
4aac020q EVEN THE APPOINTED MANAGERS OF UNREGULATED COMPANIES IN COMPETITIVE INDUSTRIES HAVE A HARD TIME CONTROLLING COSTS
4aac020r AND THEY DON'T HAVE A PERVERSE INCENTIVE TO DO THE OPPOSITE
4aac020s FOLLOWING THE WILSON AFFAIR THE PANEL DID CONDUCT SEVERAL STAFF INQUIRIES IN REACTION TO NEWS STORIES
4aac020t ONE YIELDED REPRIMANDS OF REPS.
4aac020u DANIEL CRANE REPUBLICAN ILLINOIS AND GERRY STUDDS DEMOCRAT MASSACHUSETTS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE FOR SEXUAL AFFAIRS WITH HOUSE PAGES
4aac020v REP. GEORGE HANSEN REPUBLICAN IDAHO DREW A REPRIMAND IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR AFTER A FELONY CONVICTION FOR FALSIFYING HIS FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES
4aac020w AMERICAN STANDARD SAID IT IS VERY PLEASED BY BLACK AND DECKER'S WITHDRAWAL
4aac020x IT DECLINED TO ELABORATE
4aac020y IF BLACK AND DECKER SHOULD RESUME ITS PURSUIT SOURCES CLOSE TO THE AMERICAN STANDARD SAID THE COMPANY IS PREPARED TO RESIST AGAIN
4aac020z HIS INABILITY TO RECOVER FROM OCTOBER'S MARKET PLUNGE WAS TRACED TO A HOSTILE BID FROM TWO F- RIVAL FINANCIERS FOR BELL RESOURCES LIMITED WHICH IS CONTROLLED BY BELL GROUP
4aac0210 THE BID FORCED MR. HOLMES A COURT TO CALL OFF A PROPOSED MERGER OF THE BELL COMPANIES
4aac0211 THAT WAS THE TURNING POINT SAID DARRYL SMALLEY A DIRECTOR AT THE PERTH BROKERAGE HARTLEY POYNTON LIMITED
4aac0212 AS A RESULT THE GOVERNMENT IS TALKING OF HIGHER FARM PRICES
4aac0213 BUT HIGHER FARM PRICES WOULD ADD TO AN ALREADY STEEP INFLATION RATE
4aac0214 SO BEIJING OFFICIALS REPORTEDLY TALK OF TYING WAGES TO INFLATION AN IDEA REMINISCENT OF THE WAGE INDEXATION TRIED IN SOME LATIN AMERICAN NATIONS SEVERAL YEARS AGO WITH DISASTROUS RESULTS
4aac0215 THE ARMY WANTS TO STOP BUYING THE TRUCKS WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO HAUL UP TO TEN TONS OF AMMUNITION MORTARS AND ROCKETS TO SOME PROSPECTIVE BATTLEFIELD
4aac0216 IT WANTS TO CONCENTRATE INSTEAD ON DEVELOPING A NEW SIXTEEN TON TRUCK
4aac0217 BUT MR. ASPIN WON'T LET THAT HAPPEN
4aac0218 AT HIS BEHEST AND AGAINST THE PENTAGON'S WISHES CONGRESS CONTINUES TO POUR MONEY INTO THE TRUCK PROGRAM
4aac0219 BUT WHEN THE SUBJECT IS FARMING HE CAN'T MASK HIS DISAPPOINTMENT
4aac021a I THOUGHT I'D BE IN A HECK OF A LOT BETTER POSITION BY NOW HE SAYS
4aac021b BEFORE THE DROUGHT I THOUGHT WE HAD A GOOD SHOT AT A GOOD YEAR
4aac021c THE PLYWOOD AND INSULATION MAKER SAID IT DECLARED A DIVIDEND OF ONE SHARE OF A NEW ISSUE OF PREFERRED STOCK FOR EACH OF ITS COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING
4aac021d THE RIGHTS GIVE HOLDERS THE ABILITY TO PURCHASE COMPANY SHARES AT A STEEP DISCOUNT IN VARIOUS HOSTILE TAKEOVER CIRCUMSTANCES
4aac021e THE DISTRIBUTION IS PAYABLE TO HOLDERS OF RECORD SEPTEMBER NINE AND EXPIRES AUGUST THIRTY ONE NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT
4aac0301 POWER FINANCIAL IS A FINANCIAL SERVICES CONCERN THAT IS SIXTY NINE PERCENT HELD BY POWER CORP. OF CANADA A MONTREAL BASED HOLDING COMPANY
4aac0302 MONTREAL TRUSTCO IS THE PARENT OF MONTREAL TRUST COMPANY
4aac0303 A CANADIAN TRUST COMPANY IS SIMILAR TO A U. S. SAVINGS AND LOAN ASSOCIATION
4aac0304 THAT DECISION CAME EASILY
4aac0305 NOW HE'S WORKING AMID THE METAL FOLDING CHAIRS IN HIS TRANSITION OFFICE IN THE AUSTERE CHAMBER OF THE SENATE EDUCATION COMMITTEE
4aac0306 HIS FIRST BUDGET MUST GO TO THE PRINTER TWO DAYS AFTER HE'S INAUGURATED
4aac0307 HOWEVER ONE SOURCE CLOSE TO THE COMPANIES SAID HE WOULDN'T RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF LIMITED BUYING I. MAGNIN
4aac0308 LIMITED CHAIRMAN LESLIE H. WEXNER HAS SAID HE IS INTERESTED IN OPERATING A SPECIALTY DEPARTMENT STORE
4aac0309 LIMITED OPERATES SUCH STORES AS LIMITED LIMITED EXPRESS LANE BRYANT HENRI BENDEL AND VICTORIA'S SECRET
4aac030a BULLION DEALERS SAY THE FIVE HOUSES FIXING THE GOLD PRICE HAVE TO RESPOND TO THE NEEDS OF THE MARKET AND REQUIREMENTS OF BRITISH FINANCIAL LEGISLATION
4aac030b AS A GROUP THE FIVE BULLION FIRMS TRANSACT LESS BUSINESS THAN OUTSIDE MARKET MAKERS SEVERAL LONDON BULLION TRADERS SAY
4aac030c UNLIKE GOLD FUTURES MARKETS IN NEW YORK AND CHICAGO HOWEVER THE LONDON GOLD MARKET DOESN'T PUBLISH TRADING STATISTICS
4aac030d MR. ICAHN COULDN'T BE REACHED FOR COMMENT AND IT WAS UNCLEAR WHAT INTENTIONS HE MIGHT ULTIMATELY HARBOR TOWARD TENNECO
4aac030e HIS POSITION IN THE COMPANY IS UNDERSTOOD TO BE ONE OF MORE THAN TWENTY SIMILAR STAKES HE HAS AMASSED IN A VARIETY OF CONCERNS
4aac030f AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED HE ALSO CONTROLS AN ELEVEN POINT FOUR PERCENT STAKE IN U. S. X. CORPORATION A PITTSBURGH BASED OIL AND STEEL CONCERN
4aac030g IN AMSTERDAM STOCKS CLOSED LOWER IN VOLATILE TRADING
4aac030h SELECTED ISSUES ENDED OFF THEIR INTRADAY LOWS THOUGH AFTER WALL STREET'S LOWER OPENING PROVED LESS SEVERE THAN SOME DUTCH FORECASTERS ANTICIPATED DEALERS SAID
4aac030i VOLATILE TRADING THROUGHOUT THE SESSION *PRODUCED* WIDE PRICE FLUCTUATIONS AS DUTCH INSTITUTIONS BARGAIN HUNTED WHILE OVERSEAS INVESTORS TENDED TO SELL SHARES
4aac030j THE ANNOUNCEMENT WOULD CAP A HIGHLY PUBLICIZED SEARCH FOR A POSSIBLE NEW HOME
4aac030k IT ALSO WOULD REPRESENT A MAJOR VICTORY FOR NEW YORK CITY WHICH HAS BEEN FIGHTING TO KEEP COMPANIES FROM FLEEING THE CITY
4aac030l N. B. C. HAD BEEN CONSIDERING MOVING SOME OR ALL OF ITS FACILITIES TO NEW JERSEY
4aac030m FRED M. GIBBONS THIRTY EIGHT RESIGNED AS SOFTWARE PUBLISHING'S CHAIRMAN AND SUCCEEDS MS. BEDKE AS PRESIDENT
4aac030n HE ALSO WAS NAMED CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER A POST WHICH WASN'T FILLED WHEN MR. GIBBONS STEPPED DOWN FROM BOTH POSITIONS IN AUGUST
4aac030o SINCE THEN THE TWO EXECUTIVES HAD BEEN SHARING DAY TO DAY OPERATIONAL MANAGEMENT MR. GIBBONS SAID
4aac030p MR. MCMILLIN SAID THE TWO RETAILING UNITS COULD FETCH BETWEEN THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AND FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS
4aac030q BUT SPECULATION IN RETAILING CIRCLES PUT THE POTENTIAL PRICE TAG AT ABOUT TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS
4aac030r IT'S THE WORST TIME TO SELL A RETAILER SAID ONE INDUSTRY EXECUTIVE
4aac030s THEY MISSED THE HIGH IN AUGUST WHEN PUBLICLY TRADED SPECIALTY RETAILERS WERE SELLING AT MULTIPLES AS HIGH AS THIRTY FIVE TIMES EARNINGS
4aac030t NOW THEY'RE TRADING AT TEN TO TWELVE TIMES EARNINGS
4aac030u AND ACCORDING TO TEXACO IT COULD ALL ADD UP TO SECURITIES LAW VIOLATIONS BY MR. ICAHN
4aac030v TO ANNOUNCE THAT YOU'RE IN SERIOUS NEGOTIATIONS WITH A SERIOUS PARTNER IF YOU'RE NOT IS A SERIOUS VIOLATION MR. *BOIES* SAID
4aac030w MR. ICAHN HOWEVER TICKED OFF NUMEROUS DETAILS ABOUT THE EXTENT OF HIS NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE THIRD PARTIES
4aac030x THESE DETAILS HE SAID WERE INDICATIONS THAT TALKS WERE SERIOUS AS FAR AS HE WAS CONCERNED
4aac030y UNCONVINCED THE HARRISBURG CITY COUNCIL IN APRIL PASSED AN ORDINANCE REQUIRING LOCAL EMPLOYERS WITH TEN OR MORE EMPLOYEES TO GIVE UP TO TWELVE WEEKS OF UNPAID PARENTAL LEAVE
4aac030z HARRISBURG IS BELIEVED TO BE THE FIRST U. S. CITY TO PASS SUCH A STATUTE AND IT IS MUCH STRICTER THAN ANY STATE LEGISLATION
4aac0310 FOR INSTANCE WISCONSIN PASSED A PARENTAL LEAVE LAW IN APRIL WHICH PROVIDES ONLY SIX WEEKS OF UNPAID LEAVE AND EXEMPTS COMPANIES WITH FEWER THAN FIFTY EMPLOYEES
4aac0311 MERITOR ALSO JOINED THE FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK SYSTEM LAST MONTH
4aac0312 IT CAN BORROW INTERMEDIATE TERM FUNDS FROM THE BANK SYSTEM WHICH WOULD ALLOW MERITOR TO MORE CLOSELY MATCH ITS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
4aac0313 ITS DEPOSITS ARE STILL INSURED BY FEDERAL *DEPOSIT* INSURANCE CORP.
4aac0314 HELPED BY WEDNESDAY'S WALL STREET RALLY AND IMPROVED COMMODITY PRICES STOCK PRICES POSTED ROBUST GAINS IN SYDNEY
4aac0315 TURNOVER REMAINED THIN
4aac0316 AN EARLY SPURT OF DOMESTIC LED DEMAND DROVE PRICES TO THEIR BEST LEVELS DURING THE FIRST HOUR OF ACTIVITY
4aac0317 THEY DRIFTED FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE SESSION AND CLOSED JUST SHORT OF THEIR PEAKS
4aac0318 PEOPLE CLOSE TO THE SITUATION SAY THE COMPANY AND PILOTS' UNION WERE HOPING TO HAMMER OUT AN AGREEMENT THAT OTHER LABOR GROUPS WOULD FIND ACCEPTABLE
4aac0319 BUT MR. SCHROEDER'S LETTER SAID THE MACHINISTS WILL NEITHER ACCEPT A FAIT ACCOMPLI NOR BE STAMPEDED INTO UNNECESSARY OR IMPRUDENT ACTION
4aac031a HE ALSO SAID THE MACHINISTS' UNION WILL OPPOSE ANY TRANSACTION THAT DOESN'T GUARANTEE JOB PROTECTION FOR ITS MEMBERS
4aac031b IN HOUSTON A COASTAL SPOKESMAN SAID THE FIGHT ISN'T OVER
4aac031c WE ANTICIPATE ASKING FOR A REHEARING OR APPEALING TO THE SUPREME COURT THE SPOKESMAN SAID
4aac031d HE ADDED WE WERE QUITE SURPRISED BY THE REVERSAL
4aac031e WE THOUGHT WE HAD A SOLID CASE
4aac0401 MR. REGAN ASKED YESTERDAY WHETHER HE PLANS TO RESIGN TOLD REPORTERS NO ABSOLUTELY NOT
4aac0402 THE FORMER MERRILL LYNCH AND COMPANY CHAIRMAN ADDED FURTHER THAT IF I'M INEFFECTIVE OR NOT HELPING THIS PRESIDENT OBVIOUSLY I WOULD RESIGN
4aac0403 BUT IN THIS CASE I DON'T FEEL I HAVE ANY *PARTICULAR* CULPABILITY
4aac0404 FOUR OTHER COMPANIES ARE VYING TO SHARE THE BOOSTER ROCKET BUSINESS WITH MORTON HERCULES INC. AEROJET GENERAL CORP. UNITED TECHNOLOGIES CORP. AND ATLANTIC RESEARCH CORP.
4aac0405 A HERCULES REPRESENTATIVE CONTENDED AT THE HEARING THAT THE COMPETITION COULD LOWER THE COST OF THE BOOSTER ROCKET AS MUCH AS ONE THIRD
4aac0406 AN OFFICIAL OF UNITED TECHNOLOGIES' CHEMICAL SYSTEMS DIVISION SAID THE COMPANY HAS STUDIED WAYS OF TERMINATING THE BOOSTER ROCKETS IN THE EVENT OF A MALFUNCTION
4aac0407 BROKERAGE STOCKS HAVE BEEN WILTING FOR MONTHS BUT MR. CHANOS THINKS THEY COULD GET HIT LATER THIS YEAR IF OTHER FIRMS REPORT DOWN QUARTERS
4aac0408 SALOMON'S STOCK DIVED ELEVEN PERCENT ON HUGE VOLUME MONDAY CASTING A TEMPORARY PALL OVER THE WHOLE GROUP
4aac0409 IT CLOSED YESTERDAY AT THIRTY NINE AND SEVEN EIGHTHS UP ONE EIGHTH
4aac040a TEXAS STARTED EVALUATING POTENTIAL S. S. C. SITES ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO AND NOW HAS SOLID DATA ON SIX LOCATIONS SAYS DILLARD HAMMETT STATE ENERGY ADVISER
4aac040b FOUR MORE COMMUNITIES HAVE SINCE ASKED TO BE INCLUDED
4aac040c CONSIDERING THE STATE'S FLAT RELATIVELY EARTHQUAKE FREE LANDSCAPE MR. HAMMETT SAYS NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF TEXAS COULD HAVE THE SITE
4aac040d THE WINNERS THE AMERICANS FOR THE SECOND YEAR IN A ROW WITH A TIME OF FIVE MINUTES FOUR SECONDS
4aac040e CANADA CLOCKED IN AT FIVE MINUTES THIRTY FIVE SECONDS
4aac040f IN THE GLORY OF THE MOMENT THE DETROIT POLICEMEN HUGGED ONE ANOTHER AND SHOUTED WE'RE NUMBER ONE
4aac040g DURABLE GOODS ORDERS ROSE ONE POINT FOUR PERCENT IN JUNE BUT THE GAIN CAME ENTIRELY FROM MILITARY ITEMS
4aac040h THE REPORT WAS CONSIDERED A FURTHER SIGN THAT THE ECONOMY REMAINS WEAK
4aac040i BUT ANALYSTS SAY MANUFACTURING IS IMPROVING
4aac040j ANOTHER BAROMETER OF THE ECONOMY'S FUTURE COURSE CALLED THE LONG LEADING COMPOSITE IS COMPILED BY COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY'S CENTER FOR INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS CYCLE RESEARCH
4aac040k THE COLUMBIA COMPOSITE HAS SIGNALED RECESSIONS ON THE AVERAGE BY FOURTEEN MONTHS A SOMEWHAT LONGER LEAD TIME THAN FOR THE COMMERCE INDEX
4aac040l IT IS OF NO SURPRISE ACCORDINGLY THAT THE COLUMBIA COMPOSITE REACHED A PEAK BEFORE THE COMMERCE INDEX IN JULY
4aac040m SINCE THEN THE COMPOSITE HAS FALLEN WITH LITTLE INTERRUPTION
4aac040n WITHOUT SUCH DECISIVE ACTION BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS TO THOSE WHO HAD PROPERLY HEDGED THEIR PORTFOLIOS WOULD HAVE BEEN BROKEN
4aac040o UNLIKE THE OLD DAYS THE ENSUING SCRAMBLE FOR CASH WOULD HAVE FOCUSED ON SECURITIES FIRMS RATHER THAN THE BANKING SYSTEM
4aac040p THE FED PROPERLY SHIFTED ITS EMPHASIS TO AVERT A BREAKDOWN IN THE PAYMENTS SYSTEM ASSOCIATED WITH SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS
4aac040q THE COMPANY SAID LIFE INSURANCE AND PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE OPERATIONS HAD RECORD FIRST QUARTER RESULTS
4aac040r IT SAID THAT FINANCE UNIT EARNINGS ROSE FORTY ONE PERCENT AND THAT ITS LEASING UNIT HAD RECORD RESULTS BECAUSE OF HIGH UTILIZATION RATES
4aac040s CONSUMER LENDING ALONG WITH TAX AND TITLE OPERATIONS DECLINED REFLECTING LAGGING BUT NOW IMPROVING REAL ESTATE SALES THE COMPANY SAID
4aac040t ANALYSTS SAY THERE IS A STRONG CHANCE THAT KAO WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF AN EARLIER U. S. ACQUISITION
4aac040u LAST YEAR IT BOUGHT HIGH POINT NORTH CAROLINA BASED HIGH POINT CHEMICAL CORP. FOR AN UNDISCLOSED SUM
4aac040v HIGH POINT PRODUCES RAW MATERIALS FOR TOILETRIES AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS
4aac040w KODAK MAKES A BILLION POUNDS ANNUALLY MOSTLY FOR ITSELF
4aac040x IT SELLS ABOUT TWO MILLION POUNDS TO SIX U. S. DISTRIBUTORS WHO RESELL TO OTHERS
4aac040y KODAK KNOWS THE IDENTITY OF THE END USERS OF ONE MILLION POUNDS BUT CAN'T ACCOUNT FOR THE REST
4aac040z HOECHST *CELANESE* SELLS ACETIC ANHYDRIDE TO DOZENS OF DISTRIBUTORS A SPOKESMAN SAYS
4aac0410 IN SOME INSTANCES WE KNOW WHO THE DISTRIBUTOR SELLS TO THE SPOKESMAN SAYS
4aac0411 IN SOME CASES WE DON'T
4aac0412 BUSH SAID HIS SEARCH FOR A RUNNING MATE IS PROCEEDING IN AN ORDERLY FASHION
4aac0413 SOURCES SAID THAT SENATE G. O. P. LEADER DOLE HAD BEEN NOTIFIED BY BUSH THAT HE WAS AMONG ABOUT A DOZEN VICE PRESIDENTIAL PROSPECTS
4aac0414 BUSH WHOSE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION IS ASSURED SAID HE WON'T DISCLOSE HIS CHOICE UNTIL NEXT MONTH'S PARTY CONVENTION
4aac0415 U. S. SHOE CORP. SAID IT ACQUIRED TWENTY NINE SHOE STORES FROM ARIZONA SHOE CORP.
4aac0416 THE STORES ARE IN DENVER AND PHOENIX AND TUCSON ARIZONA
4aac0417 TERMS WEREN'T DISCLOSED
4aac0418 SCIENTISTS IN GENERAL MUST COME TO TERMS WITH THEIR RELIANCE ON CONGRESS FOR FINANCIAL SUPPORT
4aac0419 SPACE SCIENTISTS NOW COMPETE FOR ATTENTION WITH OTHER BIG SCIENCE PROJECTS SUCH AS MAPPING THE HUMAN GENOME OR THE SUPER COLLIDER
4aac041a IN THE PROCESS ALREADY ESTABLISHED SCIENTISTS IN BASIC RESEARCH FEEL SLIGHTED
4aac041b WITNESS THE RECENT DISPUTE OVER CONTINUING N. I. H.'S ARTIFICIAL HEART PROGRAM
4aac041c BUT THE LAWMAKERS ACTUALLY SPENT ONLY ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF THE MONEY AUTHORIZED UNDER THE LEGISLATION THIS *FISCAL* YEAR
4aac041d AND SO FAR HARDLY ANY OF THE PROMISED ADDITIONAL TWO POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS HAS BEEN FORTHCOMING
4aac041e WE LOST OUR BILL CONCEDES SENATOR MOYNIHAN A NEW YORK DEMOCRAT
4abc0201 A SMALLER MARKET SHARE STILL MEANS SUBSTANTIAL GROWTH WHEN THE ASSET POOL IS VASTLY EXPANDED NOTES GEORGE COLLINS PRESIDENT OF T. ROWE PRICE
4abc0202 NONETHELESS THE FIRM HAS BEEN PAYING MORE ATTENTION TO THE CONSUMER ASPECTS OF THE BUSINESS
4abc0203 RETAIL CLIENTS CURRENTLY ACCOUNT FOR ABOUT FIFTY SEVEN PERCENT OF THE TOTAL TWENTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS OF ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT AT T. ROWE PRICE
4abc0204 IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT RETAIL BUSINESS ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT THIRTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE FIRM'S ASSETS
4abc0205 FOUNDED IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY NINE GOLDMAN SACHS PRIDES ITSELF ON ITS REPUTATION AS ONE OF WALL STREET'S MOST ELITE FIRMS
4abc0206 GOLDMAN PARTNERS ROUTINELY HAVE EMPHASIZED THEIR TEAMWORK APPROACH TO INVESTMENT BANKING AND INSISTED THAT THEY HAD HIGHER ETHICAL STANDARDS THAN COMPETITORS'
4abc0207 FOR EXAMPLE GOLDMAN PROUDLY PROCLAIMED THAT ITS INVESTMENT BANKERS WEREN'T ALLOWED TO TAKE PHONE CALLS FROM ARBITRAGERS AND THAT THE FIRM RARELY ADVISED FIRMS PLANNING HOSTILE TAKEOVERS
4abc0208 THE F. S. L. I. C. FUND IS SUPPOSED TO COVER INSURED DEPOSITS OF EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY BILLION DOLLARS IN THE NATION'S THREE THOUSAND FEDERALLY INSURED THRIFTS
4abc0209 EVEN THE BANK BOARD'S STATED ONE POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS OF RESERVES IS THE LOWEST RATIO OF RESERVES TO DEPOSITS EVER
4abc020a ALSO PENDING ARE REQUESTS FOR MORE THAN TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN LOANS TO TROUBLED THRIFTS
4abc020b THE ONLY THING IN HER NEW LIFE THAT MAKES MRS. BOTTEL FROWN IS THAT SHE NO LONGER GETS TO CHOOSE THE LETTERS SHE ANSWERS
4abc020c EACH MONTH THE YOMIURI SENDS HER A BATCH CAREFULLY TRANSLATED AND TYPED IN ENGLISH
4abc020d IN A CHEERY ROOM OF HER SUBURBAN RANCH STYLE HOUSE MRS. BOTTEL WRITES HER REPLIES THEN SENDS THEM TO TOKYO WHERE THEY ARE TRANSLATED INTO JAPANESE
4abc020e STILL EVEN A MAJOR SLOWDOWN COULD PERMIT HEFTY FUND GROWTH CONSIDERING LAST YEAR'S RECORD GROSS SALES TO INVESTORS OF TWO HUNDRED SIXTEEN BILLION DOLLARS
4abc020f NET NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX SALES AFTER REDEMPTIONS WERE ONE HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS
4abc020g A SPOT SURVEY HERE SHOWED THAT MANY EXECUTIVES THINK BOTH GROSS AND NET SALES FOR THE INDUSTRY THIS YEAR MAY RANGE FROM FLAT TO DOWN THIRTY PERCENT FROM LAST YEAR
4abc020h ALTHOUGH SUBSTANTIAL NEW TAXES ARE UNLIKELY THIS YEAR THE CURRENT DEBATE IS IMPORTANT
4abc020i DEMOCRATS LIKE HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER JAMES WRIGHT AND MAJORITY WHIP TONY COELHO BELIEVE THEY CAN CONVINCE AMERICANS THAT PRESIDENT REAGAN HAS BEEN TOO KIND TO THE RICH
4abc020j HOW THAT POLITICAL STATEMENT IS RECEIVED BY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND HOW IT PLAYS IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT ELECTIONS COULD DETERMINE THE NATURE OF FUTURE TAX INCREASES
4abc020k L. T. V. HAS SAID REPEATEDLY SINCE ITS FILING THAT IT WOULD FIGHT ANY CREDITOR MOVE TO EITHER REORGANIZE THE UNIT SEPARATELY OR FORCE ITS SALE
4abc020l CREDITORS ON THE OTHER HAND HAVE DISCUSSED THE IDEA ALMOST SINCE THE DAY OF L. T. V.'S FILING
4abc020m AND THE PENSION AGENCY THE BANKS AND THE COMMITTEE REPRESENTING UNSECURED CREDITORS HAVE RECENTLY BEEN HOLDING SERIOUS DISCUSSIONS ON THE ISSUE
4abc020n AS A MANAGER MR. O'MALLEY CONCEDES HE PUSHES SUBORDINATES TO WORK LONG AND HARD HOURS IF NECESSARY
4abc020o BUT AS A BOSS I PICK MY SPOTS TO BE TOUGH HE ADDS
4abc020p I ALSO LIKE TO LET PROFESSIONALS SHOW HOW GOOD THEY CAN BE ON THEIR OWN
4abc020q MITSUI AND COMPANY HAS A MINORITY STAKE IN A LEVERAGED BUY OUT FUND THAT ACQUIRED CONTROL OF JOSEPH HORNE COMPANY IN LATE NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
4abc020r A CHART IN AN EARLIER EDITION INCORRECTLY LISTED MITSUI ITS ROLE AND THE DATE OF THE TRANSACTION
4abc020s IN ADDITION THE CHART OMITTED SEVERAL LARGE RECENT JAPANESE ACQUISITIONS BECAUSE OF A PRODUCTION ERROR
4abc020t LAWRENCE KUDLOW OF BEAR STEARNS AND COMPANY DISAGREES WITH THE NOTION THAT THE ECONOMY HAS ENTERED A RECESSION
4abc020u BUT HE EQUALLY DISAGREES WITH THE IDEA THAT INFLATION PRESSURES WILL SURGE
4abc020v ALL THIS TALK ABOUT THE ECONOMY OVERHEATING AND HIGHER INFLATION IS COMPLETELY MISPLACED HE SAID
4abc020w IT'S A SNARE AND A DELUSION
4abc020x IN ADDITION LAURENTIAN AND BERNHARD M. KOCH THIRTY THREE WAS NAMED VICE PRESIDENT AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER
4abc020y HE SUCCEEDS JOHN STROM WHO TRANSFERRED TO A LAURENTIAN CAPITAL UNIT
4abc020z PREVIOUSLY MR. KOCH WAS DIRECTOR OF INTERNAL AUDIT AT LAURENTIAN GROUP CORP. AND IMPERIAL LIFE ASSURANCE COMPANY OF CANADA MAJORITY SHAREHOLDERS OF LAURENTIAN CAPITAL
4abc0210 UNCONVINCED THE HARRISBURG CITY COUNCIL IN APRIL PASSED AN ORDINANCE REQUIRING LOCAL EMPLOYERS WITH TEN OR MORE EMPLOYEES TO GIVE UP TO TWELVE WEEKS OF UNPAID PARENTAL LEAVE
4abc0211 HARRISBURG IS BELIEVED TO BE THE FIRST U. S. CITY TO PASS SUCH A STATUTE AND IT IS MUCH STRICTER THAN ANY STATE LEGISLATION
4abc0212 FOR INSTANCE WISCONSIN PASSED A PARENTAL LEAVE LAW IN APRIL WHICH PROVIDES FOR ONLY SIX WEEKS OF UNPAID LEAVE AND EXEMPTS COMPANIES WITH FEWER THAN FIFTY EMPLOYEES
4abc0213 GIVEN THE NATURE OF OUR OWNERSHIP IT'S OBVIOUSLY A VERY COMPLEX ISSUE MR. ELISH SAID
4abc0214 THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS TO CONSIDER AND WE'RE LOOKING AT IT
4abc0215 BUT NOTHING IS IMMINENT
4abc0216 WHILE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BEMOANS THE DETERIORATING QUALITY OF U. S. EDUCATION STATES SUCH AS SOUTH CAROLINA HAVE BEEN ACTING TO TURN THE SITUATION AROUND
4abc0217 NEW JERSEY FOR INSTANCE HAS LAUNCHED ALTERNATIVE CERTIFICATION FOR TEACHERS OPENING UP THE FIELD TO MANY TALENTED PEOPLE WITH NO FORMAL EDUCATION TRAINING
4abc0218 MINNESOTA ALLOWS STUDENTS TO ATTEND ANY PUBLIC SCHOOL IN THE STATE THAT WILL HAVE THEM TAKING MONEY AWAY FROM SCHOOLS THAT LOSE KIDS

4acc020r HE ALSO POINTS OUT THAT NUCLEAR ARMS TALKS ARE ALSO WHERE MOSCOW BARGAINS FROM A POSITION OF STRENGTH BECAUSE OF ITS CONVENTIONAL MILITARY SUPERIORITY
4acc020s THE DEPRESSION WASN'T JUST ONE LONG SLUMP AS THE POPULAR IMAGE HAS IT BUT A SERIES OF RECOVERIES ABORTED BY FURTHER RECESSIONS

4acc0219 I KNOW BUT IT'S CLOSE
4acc021a ANOTHER IMPORTANT THING IS THIS
4acc021b BEING A LIBERAL IS NOT LIKE BEING A DEMOCRAT

4adc0202 MELLON'S INTERIM CHIEF EXECUTIVE NATHAN PEARSON TOLD SHAREHOLDERS AT THE BANK'S ANNUAL MEETING MONDAY THAT HE EXPECTS MELLON TO RETURN TO PROFITABILITY THIS YEAR
4adc0203 BUT SEVERAL PROFITABLE MELLON BUSINESSES INCLUDING A TRUST OPERATIONS AND DATA PROCESSING COULD BE SWAMPED BY CONTINUED LOSSES FROM ENERGY AND REAL ESTATE LOANS
4adc0204 AND YET THIS HAPLESS FELLOW HAD THE GUTS TO SUE HIS FATHER AND THE AMBITION TO GRAB FOR CONTROL OF THE CORPORATION THAT BEARS HIS NAME
4adc0205 HE IS MOST ELUSIVE
4adc0206 IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO HE TOURED NEW YORK'S TAKEOVER HOUSES BLITHELY CHATTING ABOUT GETTY'S PROBLEMS
4adc0207 WAS HE NAIVELY SEEKING ADVICE OR WAS HE SUBTLY SHOWING THAT HE WAS WILLING TO GO OUTSIDE THE FIRM FOR ALLIES TO OUST THE CURRENT MANAGEMENT
4adc0208 TWO DESIRABLE RESULTS ARISE FROM PLACING CORPORATE GOVERNANCE DECISIONS AS CLOSE TO THE SHAREHOLDERS AS POSSIBLE
4adc0209 FIRST THE DECISION MAKERS CLOSEST TO THE ISSUE ARE LIKELY TO HAVE THE BEST INFORMATION WITH WHICH TO MAKE DECISIONS
4adc020a SECOND THE OPPORTUNITY ARISES FOR EXPERIMENTATION WITH DIFFERENT RULES OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
4adc020b MR. TRUMP WASN'T AVAILABLE FOR COMMENT YESTERDAY
4adc020c INDUSTRY SOURCES HAVE DISPUTED HIS CLAIM THAT HE HOLDS THAT LARGE A GOLDEN NUGGET STAKE AS WELL AS ANY TAKEOVER THREAT
4adc020d STEPHEN A. WYNN GOLDEN NUGGET'S CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF *EXECUTIVE* OFFICER HAS DENIED THAT THE BUY BACK IS DEFENSIVE
4adc020e HE WASN'T AVAILABLE FOR COMMENT YESTERDAY
4adc020f WHAT'S MORE A FURTHER DROP IN THE DOLLAR COULD HAVE THE VERY RESULT MR. BAKER SEEKS TO AVOID HIGHER INTEREST RATES
4adc020g IN ORDER TO KEEP PERSUADING FOREIGN INVESTORS TO HOLD CHEAPER DOLLARS THE FEDERAL RESERVE MUST KEEP U. S. INTEREST RATES HIGHER THAN THOSE ABROAD
4adc020h AN EVEN WEAKER DOLLAR COULD REQUIRE HIGHER RATES
4adc020i CERTAINLY GOVERNMENT CONTROLLED TELEVISION HAS HAD A ROLE IN THAT TRANSFORMATION
4adc020j MR. ROH'S STRATEGIES SAY KOREANS HAVE TEN TIMES MORE TELEVISION SETS SOME TEN MILLION THAN IN THE LAST PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS IN NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE
4adc020k THUS A RECENT KIM YOUNG SAM RALLY THAT ATTRACTED A CROWD OF ONE MILLION AT HIS HOME TOWN OF PUSAN WAS A SECONDARY NEWS ITEM ON THE NIGHTLY NEWS
4adc020l SEVERAL SMALLER PARTY MEETINGS ATTENDED BY MR. ROH LED THE BROADCAST
4adc020m ROBERTSON REMAINS THE BIGGEST THREAT ON THE RIGHT AS KEMP STRUGGLES TO SURVIVE
4adc020n THE RELIGIOUS BROADCASTER HOPES FOR A SURPRISE SHOWING IN ONE OF BUSH'S HOME STATES MAINE
4adc020o BUT IN SOUTH CAROLINA HE FAILS TO WIN THE BACKING OF FUNDAMENTALISTS SURROUNDING BOB JONES UNIVERSITY THEY LOOK ASKANCE AT CHARISMATIC <NOISE> PRACTICES SUCH AS SPEAKING IN TONGUES
4adc020p I CAN'T GUARANTEE OUR GROUP IS ONE HUNDRED PERCENT SOLID SAID AN OFFICIAL AT SUEZ A FRENCH HOLDING COMPANY
4adc020q I CAN'T TELL YOU THAT AT THOSE PRICES THERE WON'T BE ANY RENEGING ON AGREEMENTS SIGNED BY THE CONSORTIUM'S MEMBERS
4adc020r BUT HE ADDED SUCH ACTIONS COULD LEAD TO LEGAL REPRISALS
4adc020s NAVY WARSHIPS AND AIRCRAFT SEARCHED FOR A MISSING U. S. HELICOPTER IN THE SOUTHERN PERSIAN GULF AS IRAN ATTACKED TWO COMMERCIAL VESSELS

4adc020y CHECKOUT COUNTERS ARE PRIMARY IMPULSE BUYING SITUATIONS SAYS WILLARD BISHOP A FOOD RETAILING CONSULTANT
4adc020z AND THERE'S TREMENDOUS COMPETITION FOR ATTENTION NOT ONLY FROM OTHER MAGAZINES BUT FROM ITEMS LIKE CANDY TOBACCO AND RAZOR BLADES MR. BISHOP ADDS
4adc0210 THAT'S WHY MAGAZINE EXECUTIVES SAY COVERS HAVE TO REACH OUT AND GRAB BUYERS
4adc0211 FED OFFICIALS ARE PARTICULARLY PLEASED WITH THE DOLLAR'S NEW FOUND STRENGTH
4adc0212 THEY SEE IT AS A VOTE OF CONFIDENCE IN THEIR CONDUCT OF MONETARY POLICY IT REDUCES THE THREAT OF INFLATION AND EASES PRESSURE FOR FURTHER INTEREST RATE INCREASES
4adc0213 ECONOMIST DAVID HALE SAYS THE DOLLAR'S STRENGTH IS DIMMING THE PROSPECT OF AN EIGHTY NINE RECESSION AS WELL AS AN EIGHTY EIGHT FINANCIAL CRISIS
4adc0214 I JUST WANTED TO TAKE A MINUTE TO THANK YOU FOR RUNNING ALEXANDER COCKBURN'S VIEWPOINT COLUMN
4adc0215 HIS COLUMNS OFTEN PROVIDE A FRESH SLANT ON THE MAJOR ISSUES OF THE DAY
4adc0216 HIS IDEAS ARE OFTEN CONTRARY TO POPULAR OPINION BUT THEY PROVIDE NEW IDEAS TO BROADEN THE READER'S OWN PERSPECTIVE
4adc0217 FRANKFURT SHARE PRICES CLOSED MOSTLY LOWER IN MODERATELY ACTIVE TRADING FRIDAY AS AN EARLY RALLY FIZZLED AMID POSITION SQUARING BEFORE THE WEEKEND AND UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE LOWER DOLLAR
4adc0218 THE DAX INDEX DROPPED FIVE POINT FOUR NINE TO TWELVE EIGHTY NINE POINT SEVEN TWO
4adc0219 AFTER OPENING BROADLY HIGHER THE TIDE TURNED AT MIDDAY WHEN THE DOLLAR'S SLIDE TO A THREE MONTH LOW BEGAN TO WORRY MARKET PARTICIPANTS
4adc021a THE DOLLAR WAS CONFINED TO FAIRLY NARROW RANGES IN ASIAN AND EARLY EUROPEAN TRADING AS MARKET PARTICIPANTS CONCENTRATED ON MARK YEN TRADING
4adc021b THE GERMAN CURRENCY TRADED IN A RANGE BETWEEN SEVENTY THREE POINT THREE ZERO YEN AND SEVENTY THREE POINT SIX FIVE YEN THROUGH MOST OF NEW YORK TRADING
4adc021c AT THE NEW YORK FINISH THE MARK WAS UNCHANGED AT SEVENTY THREE POINT FOUR SIX YEN
4adc021d SO WHAT IS WALL STREET TELLING THE QUEASY INVESTORS THAT HOLD SHARES IN GENERIC DRUG MAKERS
4adc021e IN ESSENCE DON'T WORRY
4adc021f TAKE TWO ASPIRIN AND CALL ME IN A FEW YEARS
4adc0301 THAT DECISION CAME EASILY
4adc0302 NOW HE'S WORKING AMID THE METAL FOLDING CHAIRS IN HIS TRANSITION OFFICE IN THE AUSTERE CHAMBER OF THE SENATE EDUCATION COMMITTEE

4adc0304 BANKS WEREN'T THE ONLY ONES EXCLUDED FROM THE PRIVATE TALKS
4adc0305 STEPHEN D. SUSMAN ONE OF THE HUNTS' LEAD ATTORNEYS SAID THAT HE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THE DISCUSSIONS UNTIL HE STARTED HEARING THE OTHER BANKS' OBJECTIONS
4adc0306 BUT MR. SUSMAN SAID HE ISN'T TROUBLED BY THE MEETINGS
4adc0307 IT SEEMS LIKE GOOD SENSE TO ME
4adc0308 INTELLIGENT PEOPLE IN LITIGATION OUGHT TO BE TALKING TO PEOPLE TO TRY TO RESOLVE IT HE SAID
4adc0309 THE BANKS SOUGHT TO ELIMINATE A MISMATCH BETWEEN THEIR ASSETS PREDOMINANTLY HELD IN NON POUND CURRENCIES AND THEIR CAPITAL KEPT IN POUNDS
4adc030a WHEN THE POUND WAS WEAK DURING THE EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTIES THE VALUE OF SCANDINAVIAN BANK'S CAPITAL FELL STEEPLY IN PROPORTION TO ITS NON DOLLAR ASSETS
4adc030b THE BANKS THAT OWNED SCANDINAVIAN BANK HAD TO INJECT ABOUT FORTY SEVEN POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS OF ADDITIONAL CAPITAL
4adc030c THE ALTERED MEMO HOWEVER NEVER MENTIONED THE PRESIDENT
4adc030d INSTEAD IT RECOMMENDED ONLY THAT THE CURRENT DONORS BE APPROACHED TO PROVIDE FIFTEEN TO TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS ADDITIONAL
4adc030e AT THE TIME SAUDI ARABIA ALREADY HAD CONTRIBUTED THIRTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS TO THE CONTRAS
4adc030f WE HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO DEFER MEDIUM AND LONG TERM FINANCING SAYS MR. BLAKELY
4adc030g IN FACT WE JUST REVIEWED THIS SUBJECT AND DECIDED TO WAIT UNTIL LATER THIS YEAR
4adc030h STILL HE ADDS I THINK WE'RE HEADED FOR HIGHER RATES IN THE LONG TERM HOWEVER
4adc030i AS FOR THE SECURITIES INDUSTRY IT IS SEEKING TO RETAIN THE REMAINING LINE OF DEFENSE AGAINST BANK INTRUSIONS
4adc030j INVESTMENT BANKERS WARN OF CONFLICTS OF INTEREST AND SELF DEALING IF COMMERCIAL BANKERS ARE ALLOWED TO COMPETE DIRECTLY WITH THEM
4adc030k DESPITE THE BANKERS' DIRE WARNINGS THEY ARGUE THE CIRCUMSTANCES DON'T CALL FOR CHANGING THE HALF CENTURY OLD SYSTEM
4adc030l THE SKY ISN'T FALLING SAYS ROBERT GERARD THE HEAD OF MORGAN STANLEY GROUP INCORPORATED'S MUNICIPAL FINANCE DIVISION
4adc030m SECURITIES UNDERWRITING ISN'T THE ANSWER FOR ENERGY AND AGRICULTURAL LOANS
4adc030n THE JOURNAL'S CLIFFORD KRAUSS LAST MONTH DESCRIBED THE DEEP ANTIPATHY AMONG THE LOCAL POPULATION TOWARDS THE POLICIES AND SURVEILLANCE TECHNIQUES OF THE SANDINISTAS' INTERNAL TRADE MINISTRY
4adc030o IN THE AMERICAS COLUMN PUBLISHED ON THIS PAGE LAST FRIDAY DOUGLAS PAYNE DESCRIBED NICARAGUA'S GROWING ECONOMIC INTEGRATION WITH THE SOVIET BLOC
4adc030p AND YESTERDAY ON THE WASHINGTON POST'S OP ED PAGE LA PRENSA PUBLISHER VIOLETA CHAMORRO DESCRIBED THE EXTENT OF PRESS CENSORSHIP

4adc030x THOSE COMPANIES INCLUDE THE ACURA DIVISION OF HONDA MOTOR COMPANY B. M. W. OF NORTH AMERICA INCORPORATED VOLVO OF AMERICA CORPORATION AND PORSCHE CARS OF NORTH AMERICA
4adc030y INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS LOOKING FOR SOME EXCITEMENT IN THEIR LIVES AREN'T LIKELY TO BE ENTHRALLED BY MR. BERG'S ADVICE <NOISE>
4adc030z HE SUGGESTS THAT THEY DROP THEIR HARD EARNED DOLLARS INTO THE MOST CONSERVATIVE OF INVESTMENTS T. BILLS AND SIT TIGHT
4adc0310 THERE'S NO SENSE TRYING TO PLAY GAMES WITH THIS MARKET MR. BERG EXPLAINS
4adc0311 MARKEL CORPORATION OFFERING O- OF EIGHT HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND COMMON SHARES
4adc0312 OF THE TOTAL SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND SHARES WILL BE SOLD BY THE COMPANY AND THE BALANCE VIA SMITH BARNEY HARRIS UPHAM AND COMPANY AND ALEX
4adc0313 BROWN AND SONS INCORPORATED
4adc0314 IN THE EVENT THIS DANGER WAS AVERTED
4adc0315 AFTER RECOVERING PART OF ITS LOSS IN THE FIRST FEW DAYS AFTER OCTOBER NINETEENTH THE MARKET SPUTTERED OUT OF THE YEAR WITH A PERSISTING SENSE OF CRISIS
4adc0316 IN THE FIRST WEEK OF JANUARY THE WORLD CENTRAL BANKS INTERVENED MASSIVELY TO SUPPORT THE DOLLAR AND BACKED UP THE INTERVENTIONS WITH ADJUSTMENTS IN BASIC MONETARY POLICY
4adc0317 THE TREASURY BUNDESBANK RIFT WAS OBVIOUSLY RESOLVED AND INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION RESTORED
4adc0318 THE SENSE OF CRISIS DISSIPATED AND THE MARKET STARTED THE GRADUAL CLIMB TO ITS CURRENT LEVELS
4adc0319 IN SOME CASES CONSUMERS CAN CHOOSE AMONG AS MANY AS FIFTEEN GENERIC VERSIONS OF A BRAND NAME PRESCRIPTION DRUG
4adc031a WE AREN'T PICKING ON ANY PARTICULAR MANUFACTURER SAYS IRENE CARO ACTING F. D. A. DISTRICT DIRECTOR IN LOS ANGELES
4adc031b WE ARE JUST SELECTING A RANGE OF MANUFACTURERS WHO ARE MAKING THESE GENERIC PRODUCTS
4adc031c PERRY LEVINE HAS SAID HE WOULD RETIRE ONCE A SUCCESSOR HAD BEEN FOUND
4adc031d JEFFREY LEVINE IS ON LEAVE FROM THE BOARD
4adc031e NEITHER HAS BEEN CHARGED WITH ANY CRIME
4adc0401 THIS VARIABILITY IN FIT HAS ALSO BEEN EVIDENT IN THE MERGERS OF OTHER SOUTHEASTERN BANKING COMPANIES
4adc0402 EACH BANKING COMPANY YOU MENTIONED HAS MOVED TO PLACE ITS EXECUTIVES IN KEY POLICY JOBS IN ORDER TO EFFECT THE TRANSFER OF CULTURE POLICY AND PROCEDURES TO ACQUIRED BANKS
4adc0403 IN EACH CASE THERE HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT DEPARTURES OF OFFICIALS OF THE MERGED BANKS EXTENDING TO FORMER C. E. O.S IN SOME INSTANCES
4adc0404 BORDER SKIRMISHES ARE PERIODIC
4adc0405 THE TWO COUNTRIES ARE ENGAGED IN A CONVENTIONAL ARMS RACE THAT HAS DRAGGED IN THE U. S. AND SOVIET UNION
4adc0406 INDIA AND PAKISTAN ALSO FEAR THE OTHER'S NUCLEAR POLICIES
4adc0407 THE U. S. CONGRESS IS CONSIDERING A FOUR POINT ZERO TWO BILLION DOLLAR DEFENSE AND ECONOMIC AID PACKAGE FOR PAKISTAN
4adc0408 THE SOVIET UNION HAS ASSURED NEW DELHI THAT ANY CONVENTIONAL WEAPON IN ITS ARSENAL IS AVAILABLE TO INDIA
4adc0409 FOR INVESTORS THE PARTNERSHIPS ARE ONLY AS ATTRACTIVE AS THE UNDERLYING BUYOUTS
4adc040a MANY IN THE FIELD CONTEND THAT THE BUYOUTS BEING PUT TOGETHER THESE DAYS ARE GENERALLY OVERPRICED BECAUSE OF SEVERAL FACTORS
4adc040b AMONG THEM TOO MUCH CAPITAL CHASING TOO FEW GOOD CANDIDATES WHICH HAS PUSHED COSTS UP AND RETURNS DOWN TO WHAT THEY SEE AS UNACCEPTABLE LEVELS
4adc040c SO HOME EQUITY LOANS SEEM ALMOST SURE TO BE A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IN CONSUMER BORROWING FOR SOME YEARS TO COME
4adc040d THE PACE OF LENDING MAY SLOW AS CONSUMERS COMPLETE THE PROCESS OF SUBSTITUTING ONE FORM OF BORROWING FOR ANOTHER
4adc040e AND WHO KNOWS CONSUMERS MAY FINALLY GET A LITTLE MORE CONSERVATIVE IN THEIR BORROWING
4adc040f THE DIRECTORS DIDN'T INDICATE WHAT THE DIVIDEND RATE WILL BE ON THE SPLIT SHARES

4adc040o MACY IS OFFERING SEVENTY SEVEN POINT THREE ZERO DOLLARS A SHARE FOR EIGHTY PERCENT OF FEDERATED'S SHARES PLUS STOCK IN A COMBINED FEDERATED MACY FOR THE REMAINDER
4adc040p THE STOCK COMPONENT MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE THE VALUE OF THE TOTAL BID WHICH HAS BEEN WIDELY ESTIMATED AT ABOUT SIX POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS
4adc040q MACY'S ADVISERS HOWEVER PRIVATELY VALUE IT BETWEEN SEVENTY THREE AND SEVENTY FOUR DOLLARS A SHARE OR COMPARABLE TO CAMPEAU'S PROPOSAL
4adc040r MR. MAUCHER SAID HE HAD DISCUSSED SOME FORM OF STRATEGIC COOPERATION WITH ROWNTREE'S MR. DIXON FOR THE PAST YEAR
4adc040s MR. MAUCHER DECLINED TO ELABORATE EXCEPT TO SAY HIS PROPOSALS FELL SHORT OF A TAKEOVER BID
4adc040t HE SAID HE UNSUCCESSFULLY RAISED THE POSSIBILITY OF COOPERATION AGAIN WITH MR. DIXON AFTER THE JACOBS SUCHARD RAID TWO WEEKS AGO
4adc040u AT THAT POINT NESTLE DECIDED TO LAUNCH ITS BID MR. MAUCHER SAID
4adc040v THE SHOCKER WAS THAT THE JUDGE HAD ORDERED A HUGE DAMAGE PAYMENT BEFORE CARBIDE'S LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES IF ANY HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED AT A TRIAL
4adc040w AT FIRST GLANCE AT LEAST THE DECISION SEEMS TO VIOLATE ANY DEFENDANT'S FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO PRESENT EVIDENCE AND TO CROSS EXAMINE WITNESSES AGAINST IT
4adc040x A CARBIDE SPOKESMAN HAS DECREED THE RULING AS A JUDGMENT AND DECREE WITHOUT TRIAL
4adc040y THE KING'S REQUEST LEFT THE DELEGATES IN A TIGHT SPOT
4adc040z TO IGNORE JORDAN AND MAKE A SUBSTANTIAL FORMAL CASH PLEDGE TO THE P. L. O. WOULD SIGNAL A SHIFT AWAY FROM THE MODERATION DIFFICULT FOR THE GULF STATES TO COUNTENANCE
4adc0410 BUT TO FINANCE BOTH JORDAN AND THE P. L. O. RISKED TRIGGERING A CLAMOR FROM OTHER CASH STRAPPED STATES COVERED UNDER THE BAGHDAD AGREEMENT SUCH AS LEBANON AND SYRIA
4adc0411 AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED WARNER AND LORIMAR AGREED IN MAY TO MERGE IN A STOCK SWAP VALUED AT ABOUT SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION DOLLARS
4adc0412 CHRIS CRAFT INDUSTRIES INCORPORATED WARNER'S LARGEST SHAREHOLDER HAS FILED SUIT TO DELAY THE MERGER CHARGING THAT IT VIOLATES CHRIS CRAFT'S SHAREHOLDER AGREEMENT WITH WARNER

4adc0414 THE LAST TIME A JAPANESE NONGOVERNMENT INDUSTRIAL CORPORATION SOLD STRAIGHT DEBT IN THE U. S. WAS NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT ACCORDING TO SECURITIES DATA COMPANY
4adc0415 IN JULY NIPPON TELEGRAPH AND TELEPHONE CORPORATION WHICH IS GOVERNMENT CONTROLLED RAISED FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF TEN YEAR NOTES
4adc0416 TO RAISE MEDIUM TERM DEBT JAPANESE COMPANIES HAVE MOSTLY USED THE LESS REGULATED EUROMARKETS
4adc0417 EVEN IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES NESTLE FORESEES HUGE POTENTIAL FOR EXTENDING ITS BRAND NAMES AND HIGHLY PROCESSED PRODUCTS
4adc0418 THE COMPANY IS OPENING SEVEN FACTORIES IN ASIA THIS YEAR AND NEXT
4adc0419 IT THINKS ASIAN SALES NOW THIRTEEN PERCENT OF THE COMPANY TOTAL COULD REACH TWENTY PERCENT IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES

4adc041b YOU SEE PILES OF WHITE SNOW AND PATCHES WHERE THE DIRT SHOWS THROUGH
4adc041c MAYBE TRITON IS MORE LIKE A HUGE COMET THAN A MODEL FOR EARLY EARTH HE SPECULATES
4adc041d HE WAS A DIGGER THEN BUT HE FOUND THIS DIAMOND LYING ON THE GROUND
4adc041e HE FELL ON IT SPEECHLESS IN HIS EXCITEMENT CLUTCHING IT IN HIS FIST
4adc041f HIS FELLOW DIGGERS AT FIRST FEARED MR. SCHALL HAD SUFFERED A HEART ATTACK
4aec0201 IN ADDITION TO THE WAR OF NERVES OVER DISCOUNTS RETAIL EXECUTIVES SAID THIS CHRISTMAS SEASON HAS BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY THE ABSENCE OF A BIG HIT IN THE TOY DEPARTMENT

4aec020f <NOISE> HOWEVER ANALYSTS DON'T EXPECT THE RISE IN PRICES WHICH BEGAN LATE LAST WEEK TO BE SUSTAINED ONCE RETAILERS AND PACKERS MEET THEIR NEEDS

4agc020s BUT MR. TROTMAN SAID MR. EL SAYED ISN'T INVOLVED IN THE TRANS RESOURCES BID
4agc020t BUT WESTIN HAS SHOWN UNSPECTACULAR ALBEIT STEADY EARNINGS IN RECENT YEARS AS COMPETITION HAS HEATED UP IN THE LUXURY HOTEL MARKET
4agc020u IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX IT HAD OPERATING EARNINGS OF FIFTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ABOUT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS LESS THAN IT EARNED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO
4agc020v REVENUE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX WAS FOUR HUNDRED NINETY ONE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS
4agc020w CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN INHERITED FROM HIS PREDECESSOR PAUL VOLCKER A MONETARY POLICY THAT HAD BEEN QUITE ERRATIC
4agc020x THE FED ALLOWED THE MONEY SUPPLY TO V- GROW VERY RAPIDLY THROUGH NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
4agc020y THEN IN EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN THE CENTRAL BANK TIGHTENED UP SHARPLY
4agc020z FOR THE FIRST FEW MONTHS OF THIS YEAR I THOUGHT POLICY MIGHT BE ALL RIGHT SAYS MILTON FRIEDMAN OF THE HOOVER INSTITUTION
4agc0210 YOU COULD SAY THAT IT WAS OFFSETTING THE EXCESSIVELY EASY POLICY OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
4agc0211 BUT THE RESTRAINT CONTINUED AND IN EARLY OCTOBER BEFORE THE MARKET CRASH MR. FRIEDMAN PREDICTED A RECESSION WOULD START IN SIX TO NINE MONTHS
4agc0212 THE CLINCHER CRITICS SAY IS THE COMPARISON WITH FORDS BUILT AFTER NINETEEN EIGHTY
4agc0213 FOR THEM THE DEATH COUNT IS DOWN AS MUCH AS FIVEFOLD AND MORE LIKE OTHER CARS'
4agc0214 FOR NINETEEN EIGHTY AND LATER VEHICLES FORD REDESIGNED CERTAIN TRANSMISSION PARTS
4agc0215 AMONG THE SEVENTY EIGHT BOND FUNDS TRACKED FOR THE ASSOCIATION WARDLEY GLOBAL SELECT STERLING BOND FUND TURNED IN THE QUARTER'S BEST RETURN OF ELEVEN POINT FOUR PERCENT
4agc0216 REFLECTING THE STRENGTH OF THE POUND BRITISH BOND FUNDS PERFORMED BEST AS A GROUP WITH A SEVEN POINT ONE PERCENT MEDIAN RETURN
4agc0217 FUNDS HEAVILY INVESTED IN U. S. AND SWISS BONDS YIELDED THE QUARTER'S POOREST RETURNS
4agc0218 BUT THE RIDE COULD BE BUMPY
4agc0219 SOUTH KOREAN POLITICAL UNREST COULD CURB MARKET GAINS FOR ONE THING
4agc021a ANY SEVERE SLUMP IN THE U. S. MARKET COULD DRAG DOWN THE KOREA FUND TOO
4agc021b CURRENCY LOSSES COULD ALSO EAT INTO RETURNS THOUGH ECONOMISTS EXPECT THE SOUTH KOREAN WON WILL RISE IN VALUE AGAINST THE U. S. DOLLAR
4agc021c AND BUYING A FUND FOR MORE THAN ITS PORTFOLIO VALUE CAN BE TREACHEROUS SOME ANALYSTS SAY
4agc021d TRITON LOOKS LIKE A LOVELY BOSTON SNOW A FEW DAYS AFTER A SNOWSTORM MARVELS MR. JOHNSON THE BUSY HEAD OF THE IMAGING TEAM'S TRITON GROUP
4agc021e YOU SEE PILES OF WHITE SNOW AND PATCHES WHERE THE DIRT SHOWS THROUGH
4agc021f MAYBE TRITON IS MORE LIKE A HUGE COMET THAN A MODEL FOR EARLY EARTH HE SPECULATES
4agc0301 DILLARD DEPARTMENT STORES INCORPORATED IS OFFERING FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OF TWELVE YEAR EIGHT PERCENT NOTES PRICED AT NINETY NINE AND A QUARTER
4agc0302 SEPARATELY ITS DILLARD INVESTMENT COMPANY UNIT IS OFFERING FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OF TWELVE YEAR SEVEN AND THREE EIGHTHS PERCENT NOTES PRICED AT PAR
4agc0303 BOTH NOTE ISSUES WILL PAY ACCRUED INTEREST FROM LAST THURSDAY
4agc0304 BOTH OFFERINGS ARE BEING UNDERWRITTEN BY GOLDMAN SACHS AND COMPANY AND AREN'T REDEEMABLE BEFORE MATURITY
4agc0305 THE LITTLE ROCK ARKANSAS BASED REALTOR SAID IT WILL USE PROCEEDS TO RETIRE DEBT TO FINANCE OPERATIONS AND FOR OTHER GENERAL PURPOSES
4agc0306 THE INVESTMENT UNIT SAID IT WILL USE PROCEEDS TO BUY CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE GROWING OUT OF THE PARENT'S RETAIL SALES
4agc0307 PROCEEDS MAY ALSO BE USED TO RETIRE SHORT TERM BORROWINGS THE UNIT SAID
4agc0308 EVEN WHEN COMPLAINTS ARE FILED THEY CAN BE DIFFICULT TO VERIFY
4agc0309 AGENCIES GENERALLY DON'T USE UNDERCOVER TESTERS POSING AS PROSPECTIVE TENANTS AS THEY DO IN RACE DISCRIMINATION COMPLAINTS THEY FEAR THAT THE TESTER COULD BE ATTACKED
4agc030a INSTEAD THEY TRY TO BUILD CASES ON THE TESTIMONY OF CURRENT AND FORMER TENANTS
4agc030b DEMOCRATS HAVE THE CREDIBILITY ON THE BUDGET ISSUE ASSERTS KIRK O'DONNELL PRESIDENT OF THE CENTER FOR NATIONAL POLICY A DEMOCRATIC THINK TANK
4agc030c NOW THEY HAVE TO MAKE THE RECORD
4agc030d FAILURE TO COME THROUGH WITH A DEFICIT CUTTING PLAN HE ADDS WOULD MEAN AN OPPORTUNITY LOST
4agc030e IT IS A MISSION THAT REMAINS RELEVANT IN THE POST SEGREGATION ERA
4agc030f MANY CURRENT MOREHOUSE STUDENTS WERE OFFERED SCHOLARSHIPS BY PREDOMINANTLY WHITE SCHOOLS BUT CAME HERE INSTEAD
4agc030g FOR EXAMPLE ARCHIE RICH A DETROIT PAROCHIAL SCHOOL GRADUATE TURNED DOWN A DIVING SCHOLARSHIP FROM MICHIGAN'S OAKLAND UNIVERSITY IN FAVOR OF MOREHOUSE
4agc030h I'VE ALWAYS FELT A STRONG RESPONSIBILITY TO THE BLACK COMMUNITY HE SAYS
4agc030i DESPITE THE DECLINE IN STOCK PRICES TRADING VOLUME WASN'T OVERWHELMING
4agc030j MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED NINETY THREE POINT FOUR MILLION SHARES CHANGED HANDS ON THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE COMPARED WITH A HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE POINT EIGHT MILLION MONDAY
4agc030k BUT TRADERS ASSERTED THAT MUCH OF THE LATE ACTIVITY CAME FROM PROFESSIONALS
4agc030l THE RIVALS HAVE DISPUTED EACH OTHER'S CIRCULATION CLAIMS FOR YEARS
4agc030m ACCORDING TO RECENT INDUSTRY STATISTICS THE POST'S DAILY CIRCULATION IS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND THE CHRONICLE'S APPROXIMATES FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND
4agc030n THE POST CLAIMS TO HAVE ROUGHLY FORTY PERCENT OF THE HOUSTON ADVERTISING MARKET <NOISE>
4agc030o THE COMPANY SAID THE CHARGE IS RELATED TO THE CLOSING AND WRITE OFF OF VARIOUS MARGINAL AND UNPROFITABLE OPERATIONS
4agc030p UNITED HEALTHCARE SAID IT WILL CLOSE AN UNPROFITABLE H. M. O. IN PHOENIX ARIZONA AND H. M. O. STARTUPS IN SIX CITIES
4agc030q IT WILL ALSO RESERVE THREE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS AGAINST INVESTMENTS AND LOANS TO H. M. O.S IN PITTSBURGH PHILADELPHIA AND THE CAROLINAS
4agc030r WORLDS OF WONDER NEEDS TO CONVINCE CREDITORS TO EXTEND IT TIME THROUGH THE CHRISTMAS SEASON WHICH IS BY FAR THE BIGGEST SALES PERIOD FOR TOY COMPANIES
4agc030s IT'S IN THE CREDITORS' BEST INTEREST TO KEEP THE COMPANY GOING AT LEAST FOR NOW SAID FRED ANSCHEL AN ANALYST WITH DEAN WITTER REYNOLDS INCORPORATED
4agc030t AS OF SEPTEMBER THIRTY THE COMPANY'S INVENTORY WAS ONE HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS A SPOKESWOMAN SAID
4agc030u PRINCIPALS OF A. W. A NEWLY FORMED CORPORATION INCLUDE ARTHUR G. HAILAND FORMER CHAIRMAN OF AIR WIS WHO WAS REMOVED FROM THAT JOB AFTER THE PREVIOUS OFFER
4agc030v HE REMAINS A DIRECTOR
4agc030w AIR WIS IS THE HOLDING COMPANY FOR AIR WISCONSIN AN APPLETON WISCONSIN BASED COMMUTER AIRLINE
4agc030x BUT JAY CHIAT CHAIRMAN OF CHIAT DAY ISN'T WORRIED
4agc030y WE STARTED WITH THE UMBRELLA POSITIONING OF THE CORPORATE NAME AND WE'RE MOVING INTO SPECIFIC PRODUCT AREAS HE SAYS
4agc030z WE'RE NOT CHANGING BECAUSE OF ANY SALES SITUATION
4agc0310 MR. MIGNANELLI MEANWHILE SAYS HE'S BACKING CHIAT ONE HUNDRED PERCENT AND BELIEVES THAT MORE PEOPLE NOW RECOGNIZE THE NISSAN NAME
4agc0311 CONGRESS ALSO NEEDS TO TAKE STEPS TO IMPROVE ITS OWN ABILITY TO PROTECT SECRETS
4agc0312 CURRENT PROCEDURES ALMOST REQUIRE AN OPERATION'S COVER TO BE BLOWN BEFORE THE OPERATION CAN BE DISCUSSED OUTSIDE OF COMMITTEE
4agc0313 IF CONGRESS HAD ADEQUATE SECURITY LAWS AND PROCEDURES WITH STIFF PENALTIES FOR VIOLATIONS THE END RESULT PROBABLY WOULD BE MORE FRANK DISCUSSION NOT LESS
4agc0314 BUT THE PROPOSAL BY TEXACO'S LARGEST SHAREHOLDER WHICH COULD LEAD TO HISTORY'S LARGEST ACQUISITION INVOLVES NUMEROUS CONTINGENCIES
4agc0315 FIRST MR. ICAHN SAID TEXACO WILL HAVE TO AGREE TO SUBMIT THE BID TO SHAREHOLDERS FOR APPROVAL
4agc0316 I'M GIVING THEM FORTY EIGHT HOURS HE SAID
4agc0317 THE SCHOOL HAS VACILLATED WITH ITS SMOKING POLICY
4agc0318 LAST YEAR IT ALLOWED SMOKING ALONE AND IN SILENCE
4agc0319 BUT AS STUDENTS KNOW CIGARETTES KILL
4agc031a SMOKING IS UN QUAKER LIKE AS WELL AS STUPID
4agc031b MR. JACOBS DESCRIBED THE CURRENT EIGHT PERCENT INFLATION RATE AS HIGHER THAN DESIRABLE
4agc031c HE ALSO SAID IT MIGHT ACCELERATE FURTHER OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS BEFORE LEVELING OFF
4agc031d BUT THE FINANCIAL SECRETARY SAID HE HOPED THAT PRICE INCREASES LIKE THE LABOR SHORTAGE WOULD EASE IF THE LOCAL ECONOMY SLOWS AS HE HAS PREDICTED
4agc0401 TO MANY OBSERVERS THE SITE WILL BE A BONANZA FOR WHOEVER DEVELOPS IT
4agc0402 IT'S ONE OF THE FINEST PIECES OF LAND THAT YOU CAN FIND SAYS SANFORD GOODKIN A MARINA DEL REY CALIFORNIA HOUSING CONSULTANT
4agc0403 YOU COULD BUILD ALMOST ANYTHING THERE HOUSING OFFICES RETAIL AND IT WOULD BE A SURE FIRE SUCCESS
4agc0404 ADDS ROB MAGUIRE OF MAGUIRE THOMAS PARTNERS A LOS ANGELES BASED OFFICE DEVELOPER IT'S A TERRIFIC LOCATION
4agc0405 AMONG THE UNANSWERED QUESTIONS DID MESSRS.
4agc0406 BOESKY OR STEINBERG RECEIVE INSIDE INFORMATION ABOUT THE SECRET MERGER TALKS
4agc0407 DID THEIR LARGE POTENTIALLY UNFRIENDLY POSITIONS IN HARRIS ENCOURAGE HARRIS OFFICIALS TO COMPLETE A SALE
4agc0408 WERE THEY WORKING TOGETHER SEPARATELY OR IN CONCERT WITH DREXEL OFFICIALS TO BRING ABOUT A SALE OF HARRIS
4agc0409 IN ADDITION TO THE WAR OF NERVES OVER DISCOUNTS RETAIL EXECUTIVES SAID THIS CHRISTMAS SEASON HAS BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY THE ABSENCE OF A BIG HIT IN THE TOY DEPARTMENT
4agc040a BUT RETAILERS HAVE SEEN STRONG SALES OF BIG TICKET ITEMS TO WELL HEELED CUSTOMERS
4agc040b THEY ARE BUYING TO BEAT THE NEW TAX LAW WHICH WILL END THE DEDUCTION OF SALES TAX AND SOME INTEREST EXPENSES
4agc040c THE LAW EVEN COMES WITH ITS OWN CATCH TWENTY TWO
4agc040d YOU'LL NEVER AGAIN BE ABLE TO FILL OUT YOUR OWN TAX RETURN ROGER TELLS ME
4agc040e BUT THE LAW ALSO SAYS YOU PROBABLY NO LONGER CAN DEDUCT THE COST OF HIRING PROFESSIONAL HELP
4agc040f IN ADDITION TO SEVERAL CHECKING ACCOUNTS AND A MONEY MARKET FUND HE STILL KEEPS AN OLD FASHIONED SAVINGS ACCOUNT
4agc040g THE REASON
4agc040h TO BE FAIR TO THE BANK MR. MERRITT SAYS
4agc040i IN EXCHANGE FOR GOOD BANKING SERVICE HE FEELS IT'S ONLY REASONABLE TO ALLOW THE BANK A DOLLOP OF LOW COST FUNDS
4agc040j IT HAS RELIEVED AT LEAST SOME OF THE FRUSTRATION FELT BY THE FARMERS SAYS PETER BRENT A MEMBER OF A FARM ACTIVIST GROUP
4agc040k IF THEY GO TO MEDIATION AT LEAST THE LENDER HAS TO LISTEN
4agc040l NEARLY A DOZEN OTHER STATES HAVE INQUIRED INTO IOWA'S PROGRAM
4agc040m AND MANDATORY MEDIATION MODELED ON IOWA'S PROGRAM IS CURRENTLY BEING CONSIDERED BY THE CALIFORNIA AND MISSOURI LEGISLATURES
4agc040n CALTON INCORPORATED A FREEHOLD TOWNSHIP NEW JERSEY RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE DEVELOPER SAID SHAREHOLDERS APPROVED A RECAPITALIZATION PLAN CREATING A NEW CLASS OF STOCK
4agc040o THE CLASS B. SHARES WHICH HAVE TEN TIMES THE VOTING POWER OF COMMON WILL BE DISTRIBUTED TO CURRENT HOLDERS
4agc040p CLASS B. SHARES CAN BE CONVERTED INTO REGULAR COMMON BUT GENERALLY WON'T BE TRANSFERABLE
4agc040q SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD JULY THIRTY FIRST WILL GET ONE CLASS B. SHARE FOR EACH COMMON SHARE HELD
4agc040r COMPANIES OFTEN CREATE DUAL CLASSES OF STOCK TO CONCENTRATING THE VOTING RIGHTS IN FRIENDLY HANDS THEREBY DISCOURAGING PEOPLE FROM MAKING UNFRIENDLY TAKEOVER BIDS
4agc040s THERE'S SOME PAPER OUT FOR BIDS YOU HAVEN'T HEARD ABOUT CADWALLADER BECAUSE YOU DO ONLY DOMESTIC
4agc040t COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT BONDS WITH THE COUPON INDEXED TO THE STREET PRICE OF COCAINE
4agc040u SOLID INVESTMENT BUT INTRIGUING
4agc040v I THINK WE'RE GOING TO SPRING FOR THAT
4agc040w ANOTHER INCENTIVE THAT FOOD PROCESSORS CITE FOR GETTING INTO THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS IS THE HIGH COST OF INTRODUCING NEW GROCERY ITEMS
4agc040x STARTING A NEW BRAND CAN EASILY COST GENERAL MILLS MORE THAN TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN DEVELOPMENT AND PROMOTION COSTS
4agc040y OF COURSE THE OLIVE GARDEN START UP BRICK AND MORTAR AND ALL HAS COST FIVE TIMES THAT
4agc040z MOST ANALYSTS SAID THE INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS OF THE TWO BANKS MAKE A GOOD FIT
4agc0410 GENERALE DE BANQUE HAS A STRONG NETWORK IN AFRICA WHILE AMRO HAS MORE OPERATIONS IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND FAR EAST
4agc0411 AND WHILE GENERALE DE BANQUE HAS AN IMPORTANT COMMERCIAL BANKING OPERATION AMRO HAS MORE EXPERIENCE IN BROKERAGE AND INVESTMENT SERVICES FOR ITS CLIENTS
4agc0412 CHRYSLER IS RESUMING EXPORTS TO EUROPE AFTER ITS FINANCIAL PROBLEMS IN THE LATE NINETEEN SEVENTIES FORCED IT TO LEAVE THE MARKET
4agc0413 THE COMPANY PLANS TO SHIP VERSIONS OF ITS DODGE SHADOW DODGE DAYTONA SHELBY Z. PLYMOUTH VOYAGER AND THE LEBARON SEDAN COUPE AND CONVERTIBLE
4agc0414 THE CARS WILL BE SOLD FIRST IN WEST GERMANY BELGIUM AUSTRIA THE NETHERLANDS AND SWITZERLAND
4agc0415 THE REPORT DOESN'T PREDICT ANY IMMINENT CRASH
4agc0416 INDEED ITS DETAILED ANALYSIS CITES SEVERAL POSITIVE FACTORS
4agc0417 SOLID USER DEMAND GENERATED BY HONG KONG'S ROBUST ECONOMY AND RISING INCOMES IS ONE FACTOR
4agc0418 ANOTHER IS HEAVY INVESTMENT INFLOWS FROM JAPAN AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND CHINA AND TAIWAN
4agc0419 BUT THIS RELIANCE ALSO RAISES THE STAKES IN THE FARMERS RACE
4agc041a THE WHOLE GROUP STRATEGY GOES OUT THE DOOR IF B. A. T. LOSES FARMERS SAYS PAUL BURKE AN ANALYST AT LONDON STOCKBROKERS KLEINWORT GRIEVESON SECURITIES
4agc041b AND YOU'RE PERCEIVED AS A LOSER WHICH YOU DON'T WANT TO BE IN AMERICA
4agc041c IN THE CURRENT DEBATE MR. BUSH IS USING THE A. C. L. U. TO PIN A LIBERAL LABEL ON HIS DEMOCRATIC CHALLENGER
4agc041d BUT THE A. C. L. U. HAS RELIED THROUGHOUT MUCH OF ITS HISTORY ON REPUBLICAN SUPPORT AND HAS ALLIED ITSELF WITH REPUBLICANS ON NUMEROUS ISSUES
4agc041e <NOISE> IN THE CURRENT CONTROVERSY SOME REPUBLICANS ARE TRYING TO MINIMIZE THEIR PAST INVOLVEMENT
4agc041f NOBODY KNOWS I HAVE THIS DISEASE MR. PARR CONFIDED
4agc041g I'VE GOT FOURTEEN PEOPLE WORKING FOR ME AND IF THEY FIND OUT THEY'LL LEAVE ME
4agc041h I COULD NEVER TELL THEM
4ahc0201 OCTOBER'S CONTRACTING FOR TRANSPORTATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONSTRUCTION SURGED THIRTY SEVEN PERCENT TO AN ANNUAL RATE OF FORTY FOUR POINT THREE NINE BILLION DOLLARS FOLLOWING A SHARP DECLINE IN SEPTEMBER
4ahc0202 THE RALLY IN PUBLIC WORKS CONSTRUCTION DOMINATED THE MONTH'S ACTIVITY
4ahc0203 MODEST GAINS IN HOME BUILDING WERE OFFSET BY A DECLINE IN NONRESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION
4ahc0204 THE NEW SERVICE DIFFERS FROM THE SHUTTLE IN SEVERAL WAYS
4ahc0205 IT WON'T HAVE THE BACKUP PLANES THAT THE SHUTTLE USES TO ACCOMMODATE PASSENGER OVERFLOW
4ahc0206 THE NEW FLIGHTS WILL INCLUDE ADVANCE SEAT SELECTION AND FIRST CLASS AND COACH SERVICE WHICH THE SHUTTLE DOESN'T
4ahc0207 SHUTTLE FLIGHTS DEPART ON THE HOUR THE NEW SERVICE WILL OPERATE ON THE HALF HOUR
4ahc0208 KIDDER PEABODY FOUNDED FOUR YEARS EARLIER LONG HAS BEEN A SOCIALLY WELL CONNECTED AND PROFITABLE INVESTMENT BANK
4ahc0209 BUT ITS POWER ON WALL STREET EBBED IN RECENT YEARS AS IT WAS OVERTAKEN BY LARGER MORE AGGRESSIVE FIRMS
4ahc020a KIDDER OFFICIALS HAVE RECENTLY HOPED THAT ITS LINK WITH GENERAL ELECTRIC AND G. E.'S LARGE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL WOULD RESTORE IT TO ITS EARLIER PREEMINENCE
4ahc020b MR. CASH OF HARVARD ADDS THERE IS A SHORTSIGHTEDNESS ON THE PART OF THE SUPPLIERS
4ahc020c BY REDUCING THE IMPORTANCE OF PERSONAL CONTACTS AND ESTABLISHING STANDARDS FOR COMMUNICATIONS COMPUTERS GIVE THE BUYER AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHOP ACROSS A BOR- BROADER LINE OF SUPPLIERS
4ahc020d HE SEES THE DAY WHEN AUTO MAKERS' COMPUTERS WILL SCAN THE COMPUTERS OF THEIR PRIMARY SUPPLIERS AND AUTOMATICALLY PLACE ORDERS WITH THE ONE OFFERING THE LOWEST PRICE
4ahc020e HERE ARE PRICE TRENDS ON THE WORLD'S MAJOR STOCK MARKETS AS CALCULATED BY MORGAN STANLEY CAPITAL INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE GENEVA
4ahc020f TO MAKE THEM DIRECTLY COMPARABLE EACH INDEX IS BASED ON THE CLOSE OF NINETEEN SIXTY NINE EQUALING ONE HUNDRED
4ahc020g THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE IS SINCE YEAR END
4ahc020h MERRILL LYNCH CANADA INCORPORATED WILL BE GLOBAL MANAGER FOR THE OFFERING AND WILL LEAD CANADIAN UNDERWRITERS
4ahc020i THE U. S. SYNDICATE WILL BE LED BY MERRILL LYNCH AND COMPANY AND GOLDMAN SACHS AND COMPANY
4ahc020j AN INTERNATIONAL UNIT OF MERRILL LYNCH WILL LEAD THE INTERNATIONAL SYNDICATE
4ahc020k BECAUSE OF THAT SOME WALL STREET PROFESSIONALS THINK THE STOCK LOOKS RATHER EXPENSIVE
4ahc020l IT HAS TRIPLED SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE LARGELY ON TAKEOVER SPECULATION
4ahc020m IT CURRENTLY TRADES AT ABOUT NINE TIMES CASH FLOW SAYS ALAN GAINES OF GAINES BERLAND AN INSTITUTIONAL BROKERAGE FIRM
4ahc020n THAT'S ABOUT A THIRTY PERCENT PREMIUM TO QUALITY OIL COMPANIES LIKE ROYAL DUTCH PETROLEUM EXXON AND MOBIL HE SAYS
4ahc020o IN TAMPA A JIM WALTER SPOKESMAN WOULDN'T DISCUSS THE MATTER
4ahc020p PEOPLE CAN SAY WHAT THEY WANT BUT WE WON'T COMMENT HE SAID
4ahc020q MR. WALTER HIMSELF AND OTHER TOP EXECUTIVES DIDN'T RETURN PHONE CALLS
4ahc020r FOR A SHIP OR MISSILE GUIDED BY THE WRONG TIME SIGNAL THAT LITTLE GAP COULD MEAN ARRIVING AT THE WRONG DESTINATION
4ahc020s IF WE LET THE DIFFERENCE GROW SAID MR. MCCARTHY WE COULD RUN INTO PROBLEMS OVER THOUSANDS OF YEARS
4ahc020t IT MIGHT BE NOON BY ATOMIC TIME BUT DARK OUTSIDE
4ahc020u THE FINANCIAL TIMES THIRTY SHARE INDEX CLOSED SEVEN POINT ONE POINTS LOWER AT FOURTEEN SEVENTEEN POINT FOUR THE DAY'S BEST LEVEL
4ahc020v VOLUME TOTALED A MODEST FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO POINT NINE MILLION SHARES DOWN FROM FIVE OH NINE POINT EIGHT MILLION FRIDAY
4ahc020w THE ONE HUNDRED SHARE INDEX CLOSED THIRTEEN POINT TWO POINTS LOWER AT SEVENTEEN SIXTY POINT TWO
4ahc020x ADMIRAL CROWE ISN'T DEFENSIVE ABOUT MISTAKES
4ahc020y IF THERE'S ONE PROFESSION IN WHICH YOU CAN'T MOUNT AN ERROR FREE OPERATION IT'S THE MILITARY HE SAYS
4ahc020z IN THIS CASE THE J. C. S. CHIEF FEARED THAT CONGRESS MIGHT CURTAIL THE NAVY OPERATION IF THE U. S. REPEATEDLY LOOKED ILL PREPARED
4ahc0210 I HAD REALLY UNDERESTIMATED HOW INVOLVED CONGRESS WOULD GET AND HOW DETERMINED THEY WOULD BE TO POLITICIZE IT HE SAYS
4ahc0211 NEW CAMPAIGN CO CHAIRMAN LAXALT MAY SERVE AS INTERMEDIARY WITH THE REAGANS EVEN AFTER EIGHT YEARS BUSH STILL FEELS AWKWARD TALKING TO THEM
4ahc0212 SOME STRATEGISTS THINK REAGAN'S RECENT RASH OF PATENTLY PARTISAN MOVES HAS BEEN A MISTAKE
4ahc0213 ONE EXPLANATION THE DESIRE OF CHIEF OF STAFF DUBERSTEIN EARLIER VIEWED AS A DOLE SUPPORTER TO INGRATIATE HIMSELF WITH BUSH
4ahc0214 THERE ARE TOO MANY CU- CASES WHERE CUSTOMS OFFICERS HAD GIVEN THEIR OPINION THE CLASSIFICATION OF GOODS OFF THE TOP OF THEIR HEADS
4ahc0215 THIS IS THE FAULT OF THE SERVICE
4ahc0216 BUT IT IS ALSO THE FAULT OF BUSINESSES THAT RELY ON THIS SORT OF INFORMAL ADVICE
4ahc0217 WE LOVE THESE HORSES HE SAYS
4ahc0218 WE HAVE A RECESSION BUT MANY PEOPLE ARE RICH
4ahc0219 IF YOU HAVE A HOUSE AND PICTURES YOU WANT A HORSE AN ARABIAN HORSE
4ahc021a EXACTLY LIKE AMERICA
4ahc021b IF YOU DON'T HAVE AN ARABIAN HORSE YOU CANNOT MEET MR. ARMAND HAMMER
4ahc021c IF YOU HAVE AN ARABIAN HORSE HE IS YOUR FRIEND
4ahc021d CHEMICAL'S TEXAS COMMERCE BANCSHARES INCORPORATED UNIT REPORTED PROFIT OF SIX POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS
4ahc021e THAT FIGURE INCLUDES A THIRTEEN MILLION DOLLAR GAIN FROM INTERCOMPANY INCOME TAX BENEFITS UNDER THE CORPORATION'S TAX SHARING AGREEMENT
4ahc021f IN THE YEAR AGO QUARTER TEXAS COMMERCE HAD A LOSS OF THIRTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WHICH INCLUDED A SPECIAL CHARGE FROM THE RESTRUCTURING
4ahc021g CHEMICAL ACQUIRED TEXAS COMMERCE IN MAY NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
4ahc0301 IN JULY COMPACT VIDEO SOLD EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS OF JUNK BONDS THROUGH DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT MR. PERELMAN'S INVESTMENT BANKER
4ahc0302 IT BOUGHT BROOKS IN SEPTEMBER FOR NINETY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS A BIT LESS THAN BOOK VALUE AND TOOK ON ITS DEBT OF SIXTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS
4ahc0303 THE PAYMENT CONSISTED MOSTLY OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES APPARENTLY BOUGHT WITH THE PROCEEDS OF THE DREXEL FINANCING AND A PROMISSORY NOTE
4ahc0304 BROOKS ITSELF BORROWED MONEY TO FUND THE THIRTY MILLION CASH PORTION
4ahc0305 BUT WHILE EUREKA PROJECTS ARE MORE EASILY APPROVED THE VAGUENESS OF THEIR FUNDING IS ONE REASON MANY EUROPEAN COMPANIES HAVE BEEN SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE PROGRAM'S VALUE
4ahc0306 ANOTHER IS ITS LOOSE ORGANIZATION WITH NO CENTRAL SYSTEM YET ESTABLISHED FOR CHECKING ON THE PROGRESS OF INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS
4ahc0307 MOST OF THE PROJECTS ADOPTED OVER THE PAST YEAR HAVEN'T GOTTEN OFF THE DRAWING BOARD
4ahc0308 BALLY'S DRIVE INTO THE HOTEL CASINO INDUSTRY HAS MADE HEALTH CLUBS AN INCREASINGLY AWKWARD FIT ANALYSTS SAID AND THUS THE MOST LIKELY CANDIDATE FOR DIVESTITURE
4ahc0309 BY SHEDDING THE HEALTH CLUB LINE BALLY COULD FOCUS ON ITS REMAINING OPERATIONS GAMBLING MACHINES STATE LOTTERIES AND AMUSEMENT CENTERS
4ahc030a ANALYSTS ALSO QUESTION THE FIT OF THE COMPANY'S THEME PARKS THOUGH SAYING A SALE OF THAT OPERATION COULD FOLLOW
4ahc030b SOME WERE QUITE VEHEMENT IN RESISTING ANY CHANGE
4ahc030c IF A COMPANY DID THIS I WOULDN'T FOLLOW THEM ANYMORE SAID ONE NEW YORK ANALYST
4ahc030d ISSUERS OF ABBREVIATED ANNUAL REPORTS ARE REALLY SHOWING CONTEMPT FOR THE TYPICAL SHAREHOLDER SAID ANOTHER
4ahc030e S. D. I. PERPETUATES THE ILLUSION THAT MORE WEAPONS EQUALS MORE SECURITY
4ahc030f OUR DEPENDENCE UPON VIOLENCE TO RESOLVE CONFLICT IS A SHORT RUN SOLUTION TO A LONG TERM PROBLEM
4ahc030g IN ORDER TO ENSURE OUR SURVIVAL WE MUST CHANGE THE WAY WE THINK ABOUT CONFLICT
4ahc030h BY SPENDING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON DEVELOPING NONVIOLENT MEANS OF RESOLVING CONFLICT WE CAN BUILD A WORLD BEYOND WAR AND A SUSTAINABLE SECURE FUTURE FOR ALL PEOPLE
4ahc030i THE WINNERS THE AMERICANS FOR THE SECOND YEAR IN A ROW WITH A TIME OF FIVE MINUTES AND FOUR SECONDS

4ahc030k IN THE GLORY OF THE MOMENT THE DETROIT POLICEMEN HUGGED ONE ANOTHER AND SHOUTED WE'RE NUMBER ONE
4ahc030l BUT THE INCIDENT WASN'T REPORTED
4ahc030m AS MR. MCGOWAN REMEMBERS IT THE UNITED CAPTAIN WHO NORMALLY FILES SUCH REPORTS SIMPLY SAID LET'S FORGET ABOUT IT
4ahc030n IT'S NOT WORTH THE TROUBLE
4ahc030o K. MART AND BRUNO'S SAID THEIR HYPERMARKETS WHICH HAVEN'T BEEN NAMED YET WILL INCLUDE SPECIALTY SHOPS
4ahc030p THE FACILITIES WILL COVER ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND SQUARE FEET OR THREE TIMES THE SPACE OF THE AVERAGE K. MART DISCOUNT DEPARTMENT STORE
4ahc030q LOCATED IN MAJOR METROPOLITAN AREAS THEY WILL BE TOTALLY DISTINCT FROM THE CURRENT OPERATIONS OF BOTH COMPANIES A PREPARED STATEMENT SAID

4ahc030t THEY ALL TURN SIDEWAYS AND PLOP DOWN ON EACH OTHER'S LAPS
4ahc030u THEN EACH GIVES THE STRANGER SITTING IN HIS OR HER LAP A BACK MASSAGE
4ahc030v NEVERTHELESS SOME ANALYSTS SAY THAT THE FED ALREADY MAY BE TIGHTENING CREDIT SLIGHTLY
4ahc030w THEY POINT TO RECENT INCREASES IN THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE WHICH IS THE RATE ON RESERVES THAT BANKS LEND EACH OTHER OVERNIGHT
4ahc030x THE FUNDS RATE AVERAGED ABOUT SEVEN AND FIVE EIGHTHS PERCENT YESTERDAY AND TUESDAY UP FROM AN AVERAGE OF SEVEN POINT FOUR THREE PERCENT IN THE WEEK ENDED OCTOBER SEVEN
4ahc030y THESE ANALYSTS ARGUE THAT THE INCREASE WAS ENGINEERED BY THE FED
4ahc030z TAX TALK BY JAMES BAKER AND HOWARD BAKER RILES ADMINISTRATION CONSERVATIVES
4ahc0310 IF THE PRESIDENT SIGNS OFF ON SIGNIFICANT TAXES THERE'LL BE A LOT OF SCREAMING AND SHOUTING SAYS A WHITE HOUSE AIDE
4ahc0311 BUT DESPITE THE RHETORIC ANY TAX BILL ACCEPTED BY THE WHITE HOUSE IS LIKELY TO DO LITTLE TO REDUCE THE RED INK
4ahc0312 SEVERE NEW TAXES PROPOSED BY THE HOUSE ON TAKEOVERS ALSO APPEAR DOOMED
4ahc0313 BUT OTHERS NOTABLY WELLS FARGO INVESTMENT ADVISERS PRESSED ON
4ahc0314 WE FELT THAT THE FUTURES MARKET REFLECTED ACTUAL TRADING LEVELS AT THE TIME SAYS FRED GRAUER THE HEAD OF THE WELLS FARGO AND COMPANY SUBSIDIARY
4ahc0315 MANY STOCK PRICES HADN'T BEEN UPDATED IN SEVERAL MINUTES HE EXPLAINS AND IT WAS LIKELY THAT SUBSEQUENT STOCK TRADES WOULD BE AT EVEN LOWER LEVELS
4ahc0316 BY DAY'S END WELLS SOLD FOURTEEN THOUSAND FUTURES CONTRACTS AMOUNTING TO NEARLY TWO BILLION DOLLARS
4ahc0317 THE GUIDE LOOKS DOWN AND PULLS AT HIS SOCKS
4ahc0318 LATER HE SAYS WHEN THE RUSSIANS LIBERATED SMOLENSK A NEW COMMISSION FOUND GERMAN BULLETS IN THE SKULLS OF THE OFFICERS
4ahc0319 AND THE METHOD BY WHICH THEY WHERE SHOT IN THE BACKS OF THE HEADS WAS A GERMAN METHOD
4ahc031a AND THEY FOUND GERMAN WEAPONS
4ahc031b THAT IS WHY THE RUSSIANS SAID IT WAS DONE BY THE NAZIS IN NINETEEN FORTY ONE
4ahc031c AND THAT IS EVERYTHING I KNOW
4ahc0401 STAN WEINSTEIN THE EDITOR OF THE PROFESSIONAL TAPE READER WHICH ALSO RANKED NEAR THE BOTTOM OF THE SURVEY DISAGREES WITH SEVERAL ASSUMPTIONS IN MR. HULBERT'S RANKING METHOD
4ahc0402 FOR EXAMPLE MR. WEINSTEIN DISLIKES THE WAY MR. HULBERT CALCULATES ENTRY AND EXIT PRICES
4ahc0403 HE SAYS MR. HULBERT SHOULD USE PRICES MIDWAY IN MR. WEINSTEIN'S RECOMMENDED *RANGES* FOR STOCK PURCHASES OR SALES
4ahc0404 MR. HULBERT CUSTOMARILY USES MARKET PRICES EITHER THE OPENING PRICE OR THE AVERAGE PRICE FOR THE DAY SHORTLY AFTER THE RECOMMENDATION WAS MADE
4ahc0405 IT IS A MISSION THAT REMAINS RELEVANT IN THE POST SEGREGATION ERA
4ahc0406 MANY CURRENT MOREHOUSE STUDENTS WERE OFFERED SCHOLARSHIPS BY PREDOMINANTLY WHITE SCHOOLS BUT CAME HERE INSTEAD
4ahc0407 FOR EXAMPLE ARCHIE RICH A DETROIT PAROCHIAL SCHOOL GRADUATE TURNED DOWN A DIVING SCHOLARSHIP FROM MICHIGAN'S OAKLAND UNIVERSITY IN FAVOR OF MOREHOUSE
4ahc0408 I'VE ALWAYS FELT A STRONG RESPONSIBILITY TO THE BLACK COMMUNITY HE SAYS
4ahc0409 MOREOVER A WESTERN FIRM HAS TO MAKE SOME CALCULATION OF WHETHER MR. GORBACHEV WILL SUCCEED IN HIS EFFORTS TO ACTIVATE THE SOVIET WORK FORCE
4ahc040a PAST EXPERIENCE AND CURRENT REPORTS INDICATE THAT HIS CHANCES AREN'T GOOD
4ahc040b ROWLAND EVANS AND ROBERT NOVAK REPORTED FROM MOSCOW LAST WEEK THAT PARTY APPARATCHIKS AND DISAFFECTED SOVIET WORKERS ALREADY ARE UNDERMINING REFORMS

4ahc040h THEY CAN UNDERWRITE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT BONDS BUT THE SHARE OF SUCH BUSINESS REMAINS VERY SMALL
4ahc040i A MAN WHO DOES THIS THE CONGRESSMEN PROFESS TO BELIEVE CAN'T BE TRUSTED
4ahc040j CERTAINLY HE CAN'T ASSOCIATE WITH THE BOY SCOUTS WHO INHABIT CAPITOL HILL HEARING ROOMS
4ahc040k OFF WITH HIS HEAD
4ahc040l A RECENT VOTING STUDY BY THE COMPETITIVE ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE TRIES TO MEASURE WHAT CONGRESSMEN ACTUALLY DO TO LOWER COMPETITIVE BARRIERS AND END CORPORATE SUBSIDIES NOT WHAT THEY SAY
4ahc040m IN THE LAST SESSION OF CONGRESS THE AVERAGE HOUSE MEMBER VOTED WITH C. E. I. ONLY FORTY PERCENT OF THE TIME
4ahc040n MEMBERS OF THE COMPETITIVENESS CAUCUS FARED WORSE THAN THE HOUSE AS A WHOLE THEIR AVERAGE SCORE WAS ONLY TWENTY NINE PERCENT
4ahc040o G. O. P. REPRESENTATIVE TOM DELAY OF TEXAS CALLS THEM MEMBERS OF THE PROTECTIONIST CAUCUS
4ahc040p WHATEVER WE THINK ABOUT THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT IN IRAN IT IS AMONG THE PLANET'S MOST VITAL TERRITORIES
4ahc040q OUR SHARED ENEMY HAS FIVE DIVISIONS ON IRAN'S NORTHERN BORDER
4ahc040r THIS LOOMING SOVIET PRESENCE THREATENS NOT JUST AFGHANISTAN SOUTH OF THE SOVIET UNION AND EAST OF IRAN BUT THE PERSIAN GULF
4ahc040s THE WARM WATER PORT THE CZARS DREAMED OF IS WITHIN REACH
4ahc040t WE WILL HAVE A LOT MORE THAN SOME KUWAITI TANKERS TO WORRY ABOUT IF THE SOVIETS GET THEIR PAWS ON THE OIL SPIGOT TO WESTERN EUROPE AND JAPAN
4ahc040u IN SHORT FALL OF IRAN TO THE AYATOLLAH WAS BAD NEWS FOR THE WEST THE FALL OF IRAN TO THE SOVIETS WOULD BE UNTHINKABLE
4ahc040v JOHN JENNINGS VICE PRESIDENT OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS' ASSOCIATION SAID DOCTOR PECK MAY HAVE TWO SCIENTISTS BELOW HIM HANDLING DRUG REVIEW
4ahc040w TWO PORTALS INSTEAD OF ONE HEADED BY TWO FINE SCIENTISTS MAY MEAN SPEEDIER HANDLING OF NEW DRUG APPLICATIONS DOCTOR JENNINGS SAID
4ahc040x BUT IF THAT DOOR IS JUST PAINTED ON HE ADDED IT MAY NOT CHANGE A LOT
4ahc040y THE EXPERIMENTAL VACCINE IS MADE FROM THE VIRUS FROM WHICH SMALLPOX VACCINE IS MANUFACTURED
4ahc040z GENES FROM THE SURFACE PROTEIN OF THE HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS OR H. I. V. WHICH CAUSES AIDS ARE INSERTED INTO SMALLPOX VACCINE VIRUS USING BIOTECHNOLOGY TECHNIQUES
4ahc0410 A CONTROL GROUP IN THE STUDY WILL RECEIVE A SMALLPOX VACCINE
4ahc0411 BUT EXXON CORPORATION AMOCO CORPORATION AND ATLANTIC RICHFIELD COMPANY POSTED HIGHER PROFIT
4ahc0412 NEW YORK BASED EXXON THE NATION'S BIGGEST OIL COMPANY HAD THE SMALLEST PERCENTAGE INCREASE
4ahc0413 ITS NET INCOME CLIMBED FIVE POINT ONE PERCENT EVEN THOUGH GAINS FROM ASSET SALES CONTRIBUTED THIRTY FOUR CENTS A SHARE TO YEAR EARLIER PROFIT
4ahc0414 PATTEN RETAINS LAND SPECIALISTS WHO KNOW THE REGULATORY ROPES AND HOW TO GET SUBDIVISIONS APPROVED
4ahc0415 IN AT LEAST TWO INSTANCES PATTEN SPECIALISTS HAVE BEEN ON TOWN PLANNING BOARDS WHERE PATTEN HAD PROJECTS PENDING THOUGH THEY ABSTAINED FROM VOTING
4ahc0416 IN MAINE A KEY SPOKESMAN IS A FORMER STATE LEGISLATOR
4ahc0417 BURNUP AND SIMS HAS INTERESTS IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND SOFT DRINKS AMONG OTHER THINGS
4ahc0418 MR. POSNER BEGAN INVESTING IN IT IN THE EARLY S- NINETEEN SEVENTIES AND BY THE EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTIES CONTROLLED MORE THAN FORTY PERCENT OF ITS SHARES
4ahc0419 BUT BURNUP AND SIMS MANAGEMENT WANTED NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM AND AT ONE POINT EIGHTEEN TOP *BURNUP* AND SIMS QUIT IN PROTEST
4ahc041a BY NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO THE COMPANIES WERE EXCHANGING SUITS THAT HAVE LINGERED IN THE COURTS EVER SINCE
4ahc041b MERITOR ALSO JOINED THE FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK SYSTEM LAST MONTH
4ahc041c IT CAN BORROW INTERMEDIATE TERM FUNDS FROM THE BANK SYSTEM WHICH WOULD ALLOW MERITOR TO MORE CLOSELY MATCH ITS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
4ahc041d ITS DEPOSITS ARE STILL INSURED BY FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION
4ahc041e WHEN THE FEDERAL RESERVE EARLIER THIS MONTH RAISED THE DISCOUNT RATE IT DIDN'T INCREASE ITS POPULARITY
4ahc041f G. O. P. POLITICIANS PUBLICLY DAMNED THE MOVE WITH FAINT PRAISE AND PRIVATELY WORRIED THAT THE FED WAS CREATING A RECESSION THAT WOULD WIPE OUT GEORGE BUSH
4ahc041g DEMOCRAT MICHAEL DUKAKIS WAS A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE BUT ALLOWED AS HOW HE COULD SEE THE NEED FOR THE MOVE
4aic0201 <NOISE> BUT WHILE EUREKA PROJECTS ARE MORE EASILY APPROVED THE VAGUENESS OF THEIR FUNDING IS ONE REASON MANY EUROPEAN COMPANIES HAVE BEEN SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE PROGRAM'S VALUE
4aic0202 ANOTHER IS ITS LOOSE ORGANIZATION WITH NO CENTRAL SYSTEM YET ESTABLISHED FOR CHECKING ON THE PROGRESS OF INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS
4aic0203 MOST OF THE PROJECTS ADOPTED OVER THE PAST YEARS HAVEN'T GOTTEN OFF THE DRAWING BOARD
4aic0204 ONE PROBLEM WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE UNPOPULAR NEW W. FOUR FORM IS THAT THE I. R. S. FAILED TO TEST IT ADEQUATELY
4aic0205 IN FACT THE FORM WASN'T SHOWN TO THE PUBLIC AT ALL
4aic0206 IT WAS PRESENTED ONLY TO I. R. S. EMPLOYEES IN TWO OF THE AGENCY'S SERVICE CENTERS
4aic0207 OFFICIALS SUGGEST THAT THESE CLERICAL NON TECHNICAL WORKERS REALLY AREN'T MUCH DIFFERENT FROM THE GENERAL PUBLIC
4aic0208 STILL MR. GIBBS CONCEDES THAT THE AGENCY PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE SOUGHT A WIDER VIEW
4aic0209 OTHER ENTRANTS OFFER SUCH PEN NAMES AS GRANNY MR. DISCUSSION ANNA DARLING DEAR JOHN AND BEA READY
4aic020a I SUGGEST A HIP MACHO NAME WITH QUICK READER IDENTIFICATION STAN LANDERS
4aic020b I CAN PICTURE MY READERS IN A BAR AFTER WORK HEY DID YOU READ STAN THE MAN LANDERS THIS MORNING
4aic020c THAT GUY GIVES GREAT ADVICE
4aic020d NOWHERE IS THE SHOCK GREATER THAN IN TOWNS LIKE OBERHAUSEN IN THE RUHR VALLEY WEST GERMANY'S INDUSTRIAL HEARTLAND
4aic020e HERE UNLIKE IN MOST OF EUROPE THE INDUSTRY REMAINS IN PRIVATE HANDS AND BOASTS SOME OF THE MOST MODERN PLANTS TO BE IN FOUND ANYWHERE
4aic020f NOT ONLY ARE THEY EFFICIENT THEY HAVE SHIFTED OVER THE YEARS TO THE PRODUCTION OF HIGH QUALITY SPECIALTY STEELS THAT BRING HIGHER PROFIT MARGINS
4aic020g THE BOOK HE SAYS WILL BE ABOUT ARVIDA AND GENERALLY ABOUT COMPANIES SNARED IN THE TAKEOVER GAME
4aic020h IT WILL ASK SOME POINTED QUESTIONS IS THERE VALUE ADDED IN CORPORATE MERGERS
4aic020i DOES PRODUCTIVITY INCREASE AND WHAT HAPPENS TO THE PEOPLE INVOLVED
4aic020j THOSE CREDITORS INCLUDE MULTILATERAL AGENCIES LATIN AMERICAN AND SOME EUROPEAN GOVERNMENTS AND SHORT TERM COMMERCIAL BANK CREDITORS AND SUPPLIERS
4aic020k PERU RECENTLY RESUMED DEBT PAYMENTS TO THE INTER AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
4aic020l BUT THERE AREN'T ANY CURRENT PLANS TO RESUME PAYMENTS TO THE WORLD BANK OR THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND THE ADVISER SAID
4aic020m THE THREE DIRECTORS WERE AMONG THE FIVE WHO REJECTED THE LEBOW OFFER WITH THREE INSIDE DIRECTORS ABSTAINING
4aic020n THEY HAD SAID HOWEVER THAT THEY WOULD FAVOR AN ACQUISITION UPON TERMS WHICH WERE INDEPENDENTLY APPRAISED AS FAIR BY SHAREHOLDERS
4aic020o THEY REJECTED THE EARLIER OFFER BECAUSE FIRST BOSTON CORP; WAS UNABLE TO RENDER A FAIRNESS OPINION
4aic020p <NOISE> COMPUTER DO MOST CHARTING THESE DAYS BUT DIEHARDS SAY DRAWING THEM BY HAND GIVES A BETTER FEEL FOR THE MARKET
4aic020q THE COMPUTER DOESN'T WORRY ABOUT ABERRATIONS LIKE THIS *SAYS* MR. ELIADES WHO CHARTS ELECTRONICALLY AS WELL AS MANUALLY
4aic020r YOU ADD ON FIVE SHEETS OF PAPER YOU KNOW HOW THE MARKET IS DOING
4aic020s MR. FORBES SAID HE HAD HAD NO COMMUNICATION WITH ANYONE FROM THE I. R. S. TRYING TO DISSUADE HIM FROM PUBLISHING SUCH A STORY
4aic020t I ASSURE YOU THAT MR. FORBES DOESN'T KILL STORIES AT THE REQUEST OF THE I. R. S. OR ANYONE ELSE HE SAID
4aic020u INDEED HE ADDED SUCH A CALL WOULD ALMOST ENSURE THE APPEARANCE OF SUCH A STORY
4aic020v MR. FORBES ALSO SAID HE WOULD BE HARD PUT TO THINK OF THE COMMISSIONER'S NAME
4aic020w <NOISE> ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE TALKS SURPRISED ANALYSTS AND FAILED TO IMPRESS INVESTORS
4aic020x BRITISH AEROSPACE SHARES FELL TWENTY FIVE PENCE FOR FORTY FOUR CENTS TO THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE PENCE IN LATE TRADING YESTERDAY ON LONDON'S STOCK EXCHANGE
4aic020y THE HANDFUL OF ROVER SHARES TRADING JUMPED NINETEEN PENCE TO EIGHTY SIX PENCE AFTER THE ANNOUNCEMENT BUT FELL BACK TO EIGHTY TWO PENCE
4aic020z MR. ZIA SAID THAT DESPITE THEIR DIFFERENCES THE RESISTANCE WOULD OVERTHROW THE KABUL REGIME
4aic0210 LOOK AT THE PALESTINIANS THEY HAVE BEEN FIGHTING FOR THEIR RIGHTS FOR FORTY YEARS HE SAID
4aic0211 THEY HAVEN'T ACHIEVED WHAT SEVEN DIVIDED AFGHAN PARTIES HAVE ACHIEVED IN EIGHT YEARS
4aic0212 IF THE RESISTANT FEUD OVER POWER ONCE THE KABUL REGIME FALLS HE SAID I WOULDN'T CARE LESS
4aic0213 AT FIRST THE REBELS TRIED TO STRUGGLE ALONG WITH THEIR HOME GROWN MULES
4aic0214 BUT THESE ANIMALS WERE A SCRAWNY LOT BY AMERICAN STANDARDS AND WHEN THEY WEREN'T WORKED TO DEATH THEY WERE GUNNED DOWN BY THE SOVIETS
4aic0215 THE TURKS WERE NEARBY BUT THEY ALSO HAD INFERIOR MULES
4aic0216 THE CHINESE CHARGED OUTLANDISH RATES FULLY TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A MULE
4aic0217 THE EGYPTIANS WERE QUICKLY DRAINED OF THEIR SUPPLY
4aic0218 THE U. S. WAS THE REBELS' LAST BEST HOPE
4aic0219 SCIENTISTS IN GENERAL MUST COME TO TERMS WITH THEIR RELIANCE ON CONGRESS FOR FINANCIAL SUPPORT
4aic021a SPACE SCIENTISTS NOW COMPETE FOR ATTENTION WITH OTHER BIG SCIENCE PROJECTS SUCH AS MAPPING THE HUMAN GENOME OR THE SUPER COLLIDER
4aic021b IN THE PROCESS ALREADY ESTABLISHED SCIENTISTS IN BASIC RESEARCH FEEL SLIGHTED
4aic021c WITNESS THE RECENT DISPUTE OVER CONTINUING N. I. H.'S ARTIFICIAL HEART PROGRAM
4aic021d THE WARRANTY PRICE INCREASES APPEAR TO BE CONSIDERABLY MORE THAN THE UNDERLYING COSTS
4aic021e COMPUTERS HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY RELIABLE IN RECENT YEARS REDUCING THE NEED FOR SERVICE
4aic021f DIGITAL CITED ITS LOWER COSTS WHEN IT INTRODUCED ITS FREE WARRANTY EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO
4aic0301 <NOISE> CLOSED CIRCUIT TELEVISION IS THE POT AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW FOR BOXING'S BIGGEST FIGHTS
4aic0302 IT PROVIDED FOR INSTANCE THE LARGEST SLICE OF THE RECORD SEVENTY SIX MILLION ESTIMATED GROSS FROM THE RECENT SUGAR RAY LEONARD MARVIN HAGLER BOUT
4aic0303 MEANWHILE YOUNG HEAVYWEIGHT SENSATION MIKE TYSON PROMISES TO GENERATE CLOSED CIRCUIT QUALITY FIGHTS FOR MANY YEARS TO COME
4aic0304 HE ALSO RELIED HEAVILY ON ADVERTISING RATHER THAN ON DIRECT MAILING WHICH IS BY FAR THE MOST COMMON WAY FOR NEWSLETTER PUBLISHERS TO SOLICIT SUBSCRIBERS
4aic0305 THIS UNUSUAL STRATEGY EVOLVED FROM A SMALL AD PLACED IN A BUSINESS MAGAZINE
4aic0306 THE NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLAR AD GENERATED ENOUGH SUBSCRIPTIONS TO PAY FOR ITSELF IN A WEEK SO MR. KOBREN BEGAN ADVERTISING IN OTHER PUBLICATIONS
4aic0307 OF HIS COMPANY'S ONE MILLION IN OPERATING EXPENSES LAST YEAR FULLY HALF WENT FOR MARKETING
4aic0308 BUT THE ORDER ALMOST IMMEDIATELY GENERATED INTENSE CONTROVERSY BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE CABINET
4aic0309 IT BECAME SAID ONE CREDITOR THE POINT OF IMPACT FOR DEBATE ON THE ENTIRE RESCHEDULING PACKAGE AND FOREIGN DEBT
4aic030a IN SEPTEMBER THE PRESIDENT'S MOST POWERFUL ADVISER EXECUTIVE SECRETARY JOKER ARROYO TOLD CONGRESS THAT MR. ONGPIN TRICKED MRS. AQUINO INTO SIGNING THE ORDER
4aic030b TECHNICALLY THE STOPGAP BILL WILL LEAVE THE GOVERNMENT OUT OF MONEY OVER THE WEEKEND
4aic030c BUT THAT SHOULD HAVE LITTLE PRACTICAL EFFECT SINCE MOST OPERATIONS WILL BE CLOSED DURING THAT TIME
4aic030d CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS HOPE HOWEVER IT WILL PRESSURE LAWMAKERS TO FINISH THEIR WORK BEFORE MONDAY
4aic030e LINCOLN HAS ABOUT TWO MILLION COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING
4aic030f YESTERDAY IN COMPOSITE TRADING ON THE AMERICAN STOCK EXCHANGE LINCOLN CLOSED THE ELEVEN POINT ONE TWO FIVE A SHARE UP TWELVE AND A HALF CENTS
4aic030g BASED ON THAT PRICE LINCOLN'S COMMON SHARES HAVE A TOTAL MARKET VALUE OF ABOUT TWENTY TWO POINT TWO MILLION
4aic030h WE'VE HAD A MAJOR RUN UP LAST WEEK PARTICULARLY FRIDAY NOTED MR. POLCE
4aic030i BUT HE ADDED THAT THE DOLLAR CAME UP TOO FAST THE MARKET'S BEEN CONSOLIDATING ITS GAINS
4aic030j MOREOVER MR. POLCE SAID THAT NOBODY REALLY WANTS TO BE TOO AGGRESSIVE TILL THE JAPANESE TRADE NUMBERS COME OUT
4aic030k RETAIL SALES ARE A CLOSELY WATCHED INDICATOR OF CONSUMER SPENDING
4aic030l THEY TOTAL MORE THAN ONE FIFTH OF THE GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT THE VALUE OF ALL THE GOODS AND SERVICES PRODUCED IN THE NATION
4aic030m BUT THE COMMERCE DEPARTMENT'S MONTHLY ESTIMATE BASED ON EARLY REPORTS FROM RETAILERS FREQUENTLY IS REVISED SUBSTANTIALLY
4aic030n THE FIGURES ARE ADJUSTED FOR SEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS INCLUDING THIS YEAR'S EARLY EASTER BUT NOT FOR INFLATION
4aic030o BUT JAY CHIAT CHAIRMAN OF CHIAT DAY ISN'T WORRIED
4aic030p WE STARTED WITH THE UMBRELLA POSITIONING OF THE CORPORATE NAME AND WE'RE MOVING INTO SPECIFIC PRODUCT AREAS HE SAYS
4aic030q WE'RE NOT CHANGING BECAUSE OF ANY SALES SITUATION
4aic030r MR. MIGNANELLI MEANWHILE SAYS HE'S BACKING CHIAT ONE HUNDRED PERCENT AND BELIEVES THAT MORE PEOPLE NOW RECOGNIZE THE NISSAN NAME
4aic030s THE EQUITY PEOPLE AND THE FUTURES PEOPLE HAVE JOINT AND MUTUAL INTERESTS SAID RICHARD L. SANDOR SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT AT DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT INCORPORATED IN CHICAGO
4aic030t I APPLAUD THE ATTEMPTS AT TRYING TO GET SOME JOINT ACTION
4aic030u IT'S A MILESTONE IN THAT REGARD
4aic030v BUT MR. PARCHER IS ALSO CONSIDERED ABRASIVE AT TIMES
4aic030w HE RUBS SOME PEOPLE WRONG SAYS LEONARD MARKS WHO HAS TRIED CASES AGAINST HIM
4aic030x HE'S VERY OUTSPOKEN
4aic030y IT DOES NOT HOWEVER SEEM REASONABLE TO THE GERMANS WHO ARE *INSTEAD* MULLING A TAX INCREASE TO SHORE UP A LEAKY GOVERNMENT BUDGET
4aic030z AS FOR THE U. S. COMMENTS ON GERMAN INFLATION A TYPICAL GERMAN MIGHT RESPOND ZERO INFLATION
4aic0310 WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT
4aic0311 THE STUDY WAS PART OF CORNELL'S RESPONSE TO CALLS BY LOCAL POLITICIANS THAT IT SHOULD HELP MORE IN THE TOMPKINS COUNTY
4aic0312 WHEN THE SCHOOLS WERE RANKED BY OPERATING BUDGET OR VALUE OF BUILDINGS CORNELL'S ONE POINT TWO MILLION PAYMENTS WERE FOUND TO BE NEAR THE BOTTOM OF THE LIST
4aic0313 IN PER STUDENT PAYMENTS CORNELL RANKED SEVENTH AT SEVENTY DOLLARS
4aic0314 BUT FREEDOM ISN'T AN ACCIDENT
4aic0315 IT IS THE RESULT OF PAINSTAKING WORK TO MAINTAIN THE STRUCTURE OF LIBERTY AGAINST INEVITABLE EROSION AT THE HANDS OF THE GOVERNMENT
4aic0316 I THOUGHT THAT MY WORK FOR THE A. C. L. U. WAS AN INTEGRAL PART OF MAINTAINING FREEDOM FOR EVERYONE
4aic0317 I NOW CONFESS MY ERROR AND EMBRACE LEADER BUSH'S PERCEPTION THAT THE A. C. L. U. IS A POLITICALLY SUSPECT LIBERAL CONSPIRACY
4aic0318 IN MY MINISTRY WE HAVE DISCUSSED THE ALTERNATIVES OF INDEPENDENCE
4aic0319 THERE ARE ALREADY TWO GERMANYS AND TWO KOREAS
4aic031a BUT AFTER CLOSE STUDY WE CONCLUDED THAT INDEPENDENCE IS A DEAD END
4aic031b WHO WOULD RECOGNIZE US
4aic031c AND IN THAT CASE WHAT'S THE USE OF DECLARING INDEPENDENCE
4aic031d THEN IN JUNE CAME A CASE INVOLVING COLLEGE STUDENTS WHO ATTEMPTED TO THROW A TUPPERWARE PARTY AT THE STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK
4aic031e THEY WERE FORBIDDEN BY UNIVERSITY OFFICIALS WHO CITED RULES PROHIBITING COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISES ON CAMPUS
4aic031f THE STUDENTS SUED THE SCHOOL BUT THE SUPREME COURT HELD IN FAVOR OF THE UNIVERSITY BAN
4aic0401 THE BUNDESBANK HAS REFUSED ANY FURTHER ACTION
4aic0402 THESE DAYS IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO PICK UP THE PAPERS AND READ ABOUT WEST GERMAN FEARS OF REIGNITING INFLATION
4aic0403 YOU HAVE TO PINCH YOURSELF T- TO REMEMBER THAT THE INFLATION RUNNING NEAR ZERO IN APRIL IS NOW RUNNING BELOW ZERO
4aic0404 THE E. M. S. APPARENTLY MUST BE REALIGNED AND THE FRANC DEVALUED TO ACCOMMODATE THE GERMAN TASTE FOR DEFLATION
4aic0405 THAT HARDLY MATTERS SAYS SIR GEOFFREY NOTING THAT WITH ALL THE TRAITOR SPIES THAT PRECEDED HIM THERE WASN'T MUCH LEFT TO TELL
4aic0406 THE POINT IS HE WAS ONE OF US
4aic0407 HE JOINED THE M. FIFTEEN STRAIGHT OUT OF OXFORD
4aic0408 BEEN IN THE CIVIL SERVICE ALL HIS LIFE
4aic0409 BANK AID OKLAHOMA SENATOR BOREN AND OTHER LAWMAKERS FROM STATES HARD HIT BY BANK CLOSING MULL WAYS TO EASE THE FALLOUT
4aic040a A MAJOR CONCERN IS A DROP IN REAL ESTATE VALUES WHEN EXTENSIVE LANDHOLDINGS OF FAILED BANKS ARE SOLD
4aic040b ONE POSSIBLE GOAL A REGIONAL CONSORTIUM TO HELP PROP UP LAND PRICES
4aic040c THE COMPANY ATTRIBUTED THE EARNINGS INCREASE TO GROWING POPULARITY OF ITS THREE PLUS NETWORK OPERATING SYSTEM WHICH IS USED WITH INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORP.'S PERSONAL COMPUTERS AND COMPATIBLE MODELS
4aic040d THE COMPANY ALSO SAID INITIAL ORDERS FOR ITS THREE PLUS NETWORK OPERATING SYSTEM FOR APPLE COMPUTER INC.'S MACINTOSH HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY ENCOURAGING
4aic040e THE SYSTEM FOR THE MACINTOSH WAS INTRODUCED IN AUGUST
4aic040f THE SUPREME COURT TURNED ITS BACK ON THE BASIC WISDOM OF THE COMMERCE *CLAUSE* LAST APRIL IN THE CASE OF THE C. T. S. CORP. VERSUS
4aic040g DYNAMICS CORP.
4aic040h THIS WAS THE CASE THAT UPHELD INDIANA'S LAW *REGULATING* CORPORATE TAKEOVERS WHICH WENT MUCH FURTHER THAN FEDERAL LAWS TO PROTECT TARGETS AT THE EXPENSE OF THE BIDDERS
4aic040i THE RESULT IS A CRUSH OF ANTI TAKEOVER LAWS IN A DOZEN STATES SO FAR
4aic040j THE ADMINISTRATION OPPOSES THE BILL AND NO SIMILAR LEGISLATION HAS BEEN INTRODUCED IN THE SENATE
4aic040k THE SENATE GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS COMMITTEE'S SUBCOMMITTEE ON CIVIL SERVICE WILL HOLD HEARINGS O- ON THE MEASURE LATE THIS YEAR OR EARLY IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT A SPOKESMAN SAID
4aic040l CONGRESSIONAL SOURCES SAID THE LEGISLATION IS EXPECTED TO FACE GREATER OPPOSITION IN THE SENATE THAN IN THE HOUSE
4aic040m NORTHGATE DECLINED TO ESTIMATE THE SIZE OF AN EXPECTED GAIN ON THE SALE
4aic040n THE COMPANY SAID NET PROCEEDS OF ABOUT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS WILL BE MAINLY USED TO FINANCE GOLD MINING ACQUISITIONS
4aic040o NORTHGATE SAID IT WILL SEEK PURE GOLD MINES ONLY
4aic040p OCEAN SPRAY SAYS IT SIMPLY CAN'T SELL PURE CRANBERRY JUICE BECAUSE IT'S TOO TART TASTING
4aic040q SO WHY NOT EXPLAIN THAT FACT ON THE LABEL
4aic040r CONSUMERS WOULD AUTOMATICALLY ASSUME OUR PRODUCT IS LESS NUTRITIOUS THAN PURE ORANGE OR APPLE JUICE A SPOKESMAN SAYS
4aic040s BUT THAT ISN'T NECESSARILY SO
4aic040t <NOISE> MACY'S IS OFFERING SEVENTY SEVEN DOLLARS AND THIRTY CENTS A SHARE FOR EIGHTY PERCENT OF FEDERATED'S SHARES PLUS STOCK IN A COMBINED FEDERATED MACY FOR THE REMAINDER
4aic040u THE STOCK COMPONENT MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE THE VALUE OF THE TOTAL BID WHICH HAS BEEN WIDELY ESTIMATED AT ABOUT SIX POINT THREE BILLION
4aic040v MACY'S ADVISERS HOWEVER PRIVATELY VALUED IT AT BETWEEN SEVENTY THREE AND SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS A SHARE OR COMPARABLE TO CAMPEAU'S PROPOSAL
4aic040w HOW SERIOUS AND PATIENT INVESTORS INTEREST IS WILL BE TESTED NEXT MONTH
4aic040x A GOVERNMENT OWNED INSURANCE AGENCY IS SET TO AUCTION OFF THE HYATT REGENCY MANILA
4aic040y THE AGENCY HOPES TO REALIZE ITS TARGET PRICE OF THIRTEEN MILLION
4aic040z GENERALLY ACCEPTED AS THE FIRST FANTASY HOTEL IS A HYATT BUILT FOR SIXTY EIGHT POINT FIVE MILLION ON THE ISLAND OF MAUI IN NINETEEN EIGHTY
4aic0410 THAT EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN ROOM RESORT INCLUDES A ONE ACRE POOL SURROUNDED BY ARTIFICIAL ROCKS
4aic0411 GUESTS SWIM THROUGH MAN MADE WATERFALLS ZIP DOWN A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOOT TALL WATER SLIDE AND OBSERVE FLOCKS OF *SWANS* PENGUINS AND FLAMINGOS
4aic0412 IN CHINA BASKETS HAVE LITTLE MATERIAL VALUE MS. TAYLOR SAID
4aic0413 THE PRICE OF A TYPICAL MARKET BASKET RANGES FROM A QUARTER TO A FEW DOLLARS IN EQUIVALENT U. S. CURRENCY
4aic0414 NO ONE COLLECTS BASKETS OR DISPLAYS THEM
4aic0415 BASKETS ARE SIMPLY USED AND USED UNTIL THEY WEAR OUT
4aic0416 THE SEEDS OF NATWEST'S INVESTMENT BANKING PROBLEMS WERE SOWN MONTHS BEFORE THE DEREGULATION OF BRITAIN'S FINANCIAL MARKETS
4aic0417 RIVALS SUCH AS *BARCLAYS* AND S. G. WARBURG GROUP P. L. C. ASSEMBLED POWERHOUSE CONGLOMERATES OF *BROKERAGE* TRADING AND FIXED INCOME SECURITY FIRMS <NOISE>
4aic0418 BUT NATWEST THEN PUSHING TO DISLODGE BARCLAYS AS BRITAIN'S TOP COMMERCIAL BANK WAS MORE RELUCTANT TO COMMIT ITSELF TO A SIMILAR POSITION IN INVESTMENT BANKING
4aic0419 THE SUIT CHARGES THAT BURGER KING ONLY ALLOWS BLACK FRANCHISES TO EXPAND ONE STORE AT A TIME WHILE WHITES ARE ALLOWED TO SIMULTANEOUSLY OPEN MULTIPLE FRANCHISES
4aic041a BURGER KING ALSO MAKES BLACKS WAIT THREE TO FOUR TIMES LONGER THAN WHITES FOR APPROVAL OF A NEW OR EXPANSION FRANCHISE THE SUIT SAYS
4aic041b THE FRANCHISE FURTHER ALLEGE THAT BURGER KING FALSELY AND FRAUDULENTLY MISREPRESENTED THE SALES POTENTIAL OF THEIR STORES
4aic041c MR. GREENSPAN COMPLIED
4aic041d WHAT HAPPENED THERE IS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT I GATHER IS HAPPENING HERE HE SAID
4aic041e JUST WHEN THE SOCIAL SECURITY PANEL WAS ABOUT TO GIVE UP THE DAM BROKE WHICH LED US TO A RATHER SURPRISING END
4ajc0201 COMMERCIAL BANKS ARE SEEKING THIS KIND OF BUSINESS BECAUSE SOME OF THEIR LINES LENDING TO BLUE CHIP CORPORATIONS FOR EXAMPLE HAVE DRIED UP
4ajc0202 <NOISE> BIG COMPANIES NOW ISSUE THEIR OWN PAPER
4ajc0203 THE OLD GLASS STEAGALL ARGUMENTS AIMED AT LIMITING RISK AND DANGERS THAT BIG BANKS WOULD END UP CONTROLLING INDUSTRY LOOK MORE AND MORE DATED
4ajc0204 INVESTMENT BANKS PROVIDE BILLIONS IN BRIDGE LOANS FOR CORPORATE RESTRUCTURINGS AND TAKEOVERS
4ajc0205 INVESTMENT BANKS SEEKING MORE CASH WILL BE ABLE TO TEAM UP WITH COMMERCIAL BANKS WITHOUT HAVING TO LOOK ABROAD AS GOLDMAN SACHS DID TO FIND JAPAN'S SUMITOMO BANK
4ajc0206 THAT LINE MAY BE WEARING THIN WITH PRIVATE BANKS
4ajc0207 THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE EVIDENCE OF SOUND POLICY MOVES
4ajc0208 OTHERWISE WHY KEEP POURING GOOD MONEY AFTER BAD
4ajc0209 IN THE FEBRUARY TWENTY SECOND ACCORD THE U. S. AND ITS ALLIES ASSERTED THAT THE DOLLAR HAD DECLINED ENOUGH
4ajc020a THEY PLEDGED TO INTERVENE JOINTLY IN THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKETS TO KEEP EXCHANGE RATES AT ABOUT THEIR CURRENT LEVELS
4ajc020b THE DOLLAR REMAINED STABLE FOR ABOUT FOUR WEEKS AFTER THE ACCORD WAS REACHED BUT THEN BEGAN TO SLUMP AGAINST THE JAPANESE YEN
4ajc020c CENTRAL BANKS INTERVENED AND EVENTUALLY HELPED ARREST THE SLIDE
4ajc020d MR. TRUMP HAD CHARACTERIZED HIS PURCHASES OF U. A. L. STOCK AS AN INVESTMENT IN A COMPANY WITH *UNDERVALUED* ASSETS
4ajc020e HE HAS SPOKEN OUT FREQUENTLY AGAINST U. A. L. MANAGEMENT IN RECENT WEEKS
4ajc020f HE HAS CALLED U. A. L.'S PLAN TO CHANGE ITS NAME TO ALLEGIS CORP. A WASTE OF MONEY AND THAT ALLEGIS SOUNDS LIKE SOME NEW DISEASE
4ajc020g THE RECAPITALIZATION WAS PROPOSED TO THWART A TAKEOVER EFFORT BY BRITISH PRINTING AND COMMUNICATIONS CORP.
4ajc020h THE OXFORD ENGLAND PUBLISHING AND PRINTING CONCERN CONTROLLED BY ROBERT MAXWELL FILED SUIT IN FEDERAL COURT IN NEW YORK THIS WEEK TO BLOCK THE RECAPITALIZATION
4ajc020i A COURT VICTORY WOULD PAVE THE WAY FOR MR. MAXWELL <NOISE> TO MAKE A NEW OFFER FOR HARCOURT
4ajc020j AS FOR THE SECURITIES INDUSTRY IT IS SEEKING TO RETAIN THE REMAINING LINE OF DEFENSE AGAINST BANK INTRUSIONS
4ajc020k INVESTMENT BANKERS WARN OF CONFLICTS OF INTEREST AND SELF DEALING IF COMMERCIAL BANKERS ARE ALLOWED TO COMPETE DIRECTLY WITH THEM
4ajc020l DESPITE THE BANKERS' DIRE WARNINGS THEY ARGUE THE CIRCUMSTANCES DON'T CALL FOR CHANGING THE HALF CENTURY OLD SYSTEM
4ajc020m THE SKY ISN'T FALLING SAYS ROBERT GERARD THE HEAD OF MORGAN STANLEY GROUP INCORPORATED'S *MUNICIPAL* FINANCE DIVISION
4ajc020n SECURITIES UNDERWRITING ISN'T THE ANSWER FOR ENERGY AND AGRICULTURAL LOANS
4ajc020o DETAILS OF THE NEW OFFER WEREN'T DISCLOSED

4ajc020s AFTER LEAVING THE SENATE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE MR. PROXMIRE SAID HE PLANS TO REMAIN ACTIVE AND HOPES TO WRITE ANOTHER BOOK
4ajc020t I'M NOT RETIRING FROM WORK HE SAID
4ajc020u I'M GOING TO WORK HARD <NOISE>
4ajc020v DESPITE ALL THIS THE NEW S. E. C. CHAIRMAN SAYS HE CAN HANDLE THE CHALLENGES FACING THE AGENCY
4ajc020w THEY COULDN'T HAVE A BETTER PERSON ON THE JOB AT THIS TIME MR. RUDER SAYS
4ajc020x I COME WITH NO BAGGAGE WITH NO PRECONCEIVED IDEAS ABOUT THE BEST REGULATORY METHOD OR THE BEST WAY THE MARKET SHOULD OPERATE
4ajc020y I COME WITH VERY STRONG CONCEPTUAL SKILLS WITH VERY STRONG HISTORICAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION <NOISE> TO THE REGULATION OF THE SECURITIES MARKETS
4ajc020z RATES ARE DETERMINED BY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PURCHASE PRICE AND FACE VALUE
4ajc0210 THUS HIGHER BIDDING NARROWS THE INVESTOR'S RETURN WHILE LOWER BIDDING WIDENS IT
4ajc0211 THE PERCENTAGE RATES ARE CALCULATED ON A THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY DAY YEAR WHILE THE COUPON EQUIVALENT YIELD IS BASED ON A THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE DAY YEAR
4ajc0212 THAT SAME ORGANIZATION HAS REMAINED IN PLACE EVER SINCE
4ajc0213 BUSH BRIGADE UNITS HOLD ANNUAL MEETINGS
4ajc0214 THEY HAVE THEIR OWN NEWSLETTER
4ajc0215 IT HAS BECOME A KIND OF PRIVATE CLUB WHICH DOLE SUPPORTERS SAY IS BASICALLY ELITIST
4ajc0216 SOME WONDER WHETHER ALL THE CONVERSATIONS DON'T MAKE MR. BEREGOVOY MORE OF AN OP- OPPORTUNIST THAN A BELIEVER IN THE MARKET ECONOMY
4ajc0217 BUT HIS AIDES SAY THAT HE WAS CONVINCED THAT HE WAS DOING THE RIGHT THING
4ajc0218 MR. BEREGOVOY SAID I AM NOT ASHAMED OF WHAT I DO
4ajc0219 THE COMPANY SAID THE RESULTS INDICATE ITS EFFORTS TO IMPROVE SALES ARE BEGINNING TO PAY OFF
4ajc021a LAST YEAR THE COMPANY INCREASED ITS TRAINING TO IMPROVE SERVICE
4ajc021b IN FEBRUARY IT LAUNCHED RADIO ADVERTISEMENTS FEATURING COMEDIAN MARTIN MULL AND IN APRIL IT UNVEILED A NEW MENU
4ajc021c PEOPLE CLOSE TO THE SITUATION SAY THE COMPANY AND PILOTS' UNION WERE HOPING TO HAMMER OUT AN AGREEMENT THAT THE OTHER LABOR GROUPS WOULD FIND ACCEPTABLE
4ajc021d BUT MR. SCHROEDER'S LETTER SAID THAT MACHINISTS WILL NEITHER ACCEPT A FAIT ACCOMPLI NOR BE STAMPEDED INTO UNNECESSARY OR IMPRUDENT ACTION
4ajc021e HE ALSO SAID THE MACHINISTS' UNION WILL OPPOSE ANY TRANSACTION THAT DOESN'T GUARANTEE JOB PROTECTION FOR ITS MEMBERS
4ajc0301 SPECULATION HEATS UP ON VOLCKER'S FUTURE
4ajc0302 SOME BELIEVE HIS ODDS OF BEING REAPPOINTED THIS SUMMER ARE ENHANCED BY THE WEAKENED POSITION OF WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF REGAN WHO WANTS VOLCKER OUT
4ajc0303 YET MANY INSIDERS DOUBT THAT VOLCKER WHO IS RESISTING THE ADMINISTRATION ON REGULATORY MATTERS WILL BE KEPT BARRING A FINANCIAL CRISIS
4ajc0304 HOWEVER ONE SOURCE CLOSE TO THE COMPANIES SAID HE WOULDN'T RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF LIMITED BUYING I. MAGNIN
4ajc0305 LIMITED CHAIRMAN LESLIE H. WEXNER HAS SAID HE IS INTERESTED IN OPERATING A SPECIALTY DEPARTMENT STORE
4ajc0306 LIMITED OPERATES SUCH STORES AS LIMITED LIMITED EXPRESS LANE BRYANT HENRI BENDEL AND VICTORIA'S SECRET

4ajc030f THE PURCHASING MANAGERS' COMPOSITE INDEX REGISTERED FIFTY SEVEN POINT THREE PERCENT FOR JUNE FRACTIONALLY BELOW MAY'S FIFTY SEVEN POINT FIVE PERCENT
4ajc030g AN INDEX READING ABOVE FIFTY PERCENT GENERALLY INDICATES THAT THE ECONOMY IS EXPANDING WHILE AN INDEX BELOW FIFTY PERCENT INDICATES A DECLINE ACCORDING TO THE ASSOCIATION
4ajc030h THE INDEX HAS AVERAGED FIFTY FIVE POINT ONE PERCENT FOR THE FIRST HALF OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
4ajc030i MANY PEOPLE HOWEVER CLAIM THAT IRRESPONSIBLE OWNERS NOT THE DOGS THEMSELVES ARE TO BLAME FOR THE HIGH INCIDENCE OF ATTACKS

4ajc030y <NOISE> THEY PREDICT THAT INSTEAD OF FALLING HOUSING STARTS WILL IMPROVE IN COMING MONTHS IN REACTION TO INCREASING NEW AND EXISTING HOME SALES
4ajc030z ONE NOTABLE EXCEPTION TO THIS TREND WILL BE THE SOUTHWEST WHICH HAS BEEN BATTERED BY RECESSION AND A HOUSING GLUT
4ajc0310 AFTER THREE MONTHS ON THE JOB SESSIONS SAYS HIS AGENDA IS JUST BEGINNING TO DEVELOP
4ajc0311 HE HAS INDICATED THAT PRIORITIES WOULD INCLUDE BANK FRAUD ENFORCEMENT AND TIGHTENING F. B. I. PROCEDURES FOR UNDERCOVER <NOISE> PROBES

4ajc031b <NOISE> THE VICTORY CELEBRATION OF THOSE WHO OPPOSED THE PLANT MAY BE SHORT LIVED
4ajc031c WITHOUT THIS PLANT LONG ISLAND STANDS A VERY GOOD CHANCE OF MAJOR SHORTAGES IN ELECTRICAL SUPPLIES DURING ITS EVER INCREASING PEAK DEMAND PERIODS
4ajc031d THIS LACK OF RELIABILITY WILL BE A SIGNAL TO BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY THAT LONG ISLAND IS NOT A DESIRABLE PLACE TO LOCATE
4ajc031e MEANWHILE LOCAL STATE AND NATIONAL TAXPAYERS WILL BE JOINING LITCO RATEPAYERS IN FOOTING THE BILL FOR THE UNUSED FACILITY

4ajc0403 THEY ARE OFTEN KNOWN FOR MAVERICK INVESTMENT STRATEGIES AND HIGH FEES
4ajc0404 AS THE MARKET CONTINUED ITS UPWARD MARCH IN EARLY JANUARY AN ALREADY MEAGER BEAR POPULATION DWINDLED FURTHER
4ajc0405 IT'S TOUGH TO FIGHT THE TAPE SAYS STANLEY SALVIGSEN THE STILL BEARISH CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST AT MERRILL LYNCH AND COMPANY
4ajc0406 THE MARKET HAS BEATEN THE BEARS INTO SUBMISSION
4ajc0407 ADDS MICHAEL METZ A MARKET STRATEGIST AT OPPENHEIMER AND COMPANY WHO HAS HIMSELF REMAINED BEARISH THERE'S NOTHING THAT WILL CONVERT A BEAR LIKE AN UP MARKET
4ajc0408 <NOISE> IT MIGHT BE SAID BY WAY OF REJOINDER THAT CONGRESSIONAL LIBERALS WILL BLITHELY ENACT ALL PROPOSED SOCIAL POLICIES <NOISE> THAT ARE POPULAR AND THEN CUT THE MILITARY BUDGET DRASTICALLY
4ajc0409 THIS IS POSSIBLE BUT UNLIKELY <NOISE>
4ajc040a IT IS A LOT EASIER TO FORM A CONGRESSIONAL MAJORITY AGAINST DRASTIC CUTS IN DEFENSE THAN AGAINST RELATIVELY MODEST EXPENDITURES ON PARTICULAR SOCIAL PROGRAMS
4ajc040b MAYBE IT IS SUGGESTED THERE IS AN EASIER WAY
4ajc040c WHAT ABOUT FIBERGLAS GONDOLAS <NOISE>

4ajc040l <NOISE> THE DECLINE REFLECTED LOWER LOAN YIELDS AND REDUCED INVESTMENT INCOME AFTER THE SALE OF HIGH YIELDING BONDS IN LAST YEAR'S FOURTH QUARTER

4ajc040x NINE OF THE TEN DEATHS IN THE PAST THREE YEARS OCCURRED WHEN CHILDREN WERE STRANGLED BY STRINGS USED TO TIE THE PACIFIERS AROUND THEIR NECKS
4ajc040y COMMISSION REGULATIONS PROHIBIT THE SALE OF PACIFIERS WITH STRINGS AND REQUIRE A LABEL WARNING AGAINST THIS PRACTICE
4ajc040z ANY FURTHER EFFORT TO REDUCE THE HAZARDS ASSOCIATED WITH PACIFIERS WOULD DIVERT ATTENTION AND RESOURCES FROM GREATER DANGERS AND THE WARNINGS PROBABLY WOULD CAUSE NEEDLESS WORRY
4ajc0410 THE AGREEMENT CALLS FOR DOVER TO MAKE A TENDER OFFER FOR CHIEF AUTOMOTIVE'S EIGHT POINT THREE MILLION SHARES OUTSTANDING
4ajc0411 EACH CHIEF AUTOMOTIVE SHARE THAT ISN'T TENDERED WILL BE CONVERTED INTO A RIGHT TO RECEIVE FIFTEEN DOLLARS IN CASH DOVER SAID
4ajc0412 <NOISE> THE OFFER BEGAN TODAY AND IS SET TO EXPIRE AT MIDNIGHT EASTERN DAYLIGHT TIME JULY TWENTIETH
4ajc0413 <NOISE> ANOTHER CONDITION IS THAT TOPEKA GROUP A UNIT OF DULUTH MINNESOTA BASED MINNESOTA POWER AND LIGHT COMPANY EXERCISE ITS OPTION TO BUY DELTONA'S UTILITY SUBSIDIARIES
4ajc0414 BASED ON CURRENT BOOK VALUE THE SUBSIDIARIES WOULD FETCH THIRTY TWO POINT FIVE MILLION IN CASH PLUS PREFERRED STOCK IN ONE OF THE UTILITY UNITS
4ajc0415 TOPEKA SAID IT INTENDS TO EXERCISE THE OPTION
4ajc0416 GIVEN THE PRICE OF THE STOCK IT'S A GOOD USE OF THE CASH SAID WILLIAM R. YOUNG AN ANALYST WITH DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT *INCORPORATED*
4ajc0417 THEY'RE DEFINITELY UNDERVALUED
4ajc0418 FOR A PREMIER CHEMICAL COMPANY TO CARRY SUCH A DISCOUNT NEAR THE END OF AN ECONOMIC CYCLE SEEMS SILLY TO ME
4ajc0419 A SHORTAGE OF ENERGY AND RAW MATERIALS IS ALREADY WREAKING HAVOC IN MANY OF CHINA'S MAJOR INDUSTRIES
4ajc041a A FACTORY THAT MAKES NIKE SHOES IN GUANGDONG PROVINCE HAS TO RUN A GENERATOR THREE DAYS A WEEK TO STAY IN OPERATION
4ajc041b THE PLANT'S TAIWANESE JOINT VENTURE PARTNERS ARE STOCKPILING COAL AND OIL FOR POWER IN CASE THEIR SUPPLIES GET CUT OFF

4ajc041e <NOISE> AT ONE POINT THIS YEAR SUPPLY SHORTAGES FORCED A THIRD OF THE NATION'S ALUMINUM FACTORIES TO CLOSE
4akc0201 RICHARD MACDONALD AN ANALYST AT FIRST BOSTON CORPORATION SAID THE RESULTS WERE IN LINE WITH EXPECTATIONS
4akc0202 THE IMPRESSIVE THING IS THE IMPROVEMENTS THEY'VE MADE IN COST SAVINGS HE ADDED
4akc0203 FOR EXAMPLE TIME RECENTLY SAID IT WOULD DO AWAY WITH ITS MAGAZINE DEVELOPMENT GROUP A MOVE MR. MACDONALD SAID COULD SHAVE THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS IN ANNUAL COSTS
4akc0204 THE F. S. L. I. C. FUND IS SUPPOSED TO COVER INSURED DEPOSITS OF EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY BILLION DOLLARS IN THE NATION'S THREE THOUSAND FEDERALLY INSURED THRIFTS
4akc0205 EVEN THE BANK BOARD'S STATED ONE POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS OF RESERVES IS THE LOWEST RATIO OF RESERVES TO DEPOSITS EVER

4akc0207 I'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO WALK PAST ANYTHING I BELIEVED TO BE WRONG WITHOUT SAYING SOMETHING MR. KAGLER SAYS
4akc0208 SOME PEOPLE MIGHT SAY YEAH BUT YOU THINK TOO MUCH IS WRONG
4akc0209 MAYBE I COULD HAVE BEEN MORE DIPLOMATIC
4akc020a BUT NO I WOULDN'T HAVE DONE ANYTHING DIFFERENTLY
4akc020b I DON'T CHOOSE TO LIVE THIS WAY

4akc020h THE GOVERNMENT FACES A KNOTTY SURPLUS PROBLEM
4akc020i U. S. STORAGE BINS HOLD ROUGHLY AN EIGHT MONTH SUPPLY OF CORN AND A TEN MONTH SUPPLY OF WHEAT WHEN A THREE MONTH SUPPLY WOULD DO
4akc020j MAKING MATTERS WORSE THE HARVEST RIPENING IN THE FIELDS PROMISES TO BE A MONSTER PORTENDING RECORD POST HARVEST SUPPLIES OF CORN AND A GLUT OF OTHER COMMODITIES
4akc020k TO HELP CUT PRODUCTION THE U. S. IS PAYING FARMERS AN ANNUAL RENT FOR TEN YEARS TO IDLE EROSION PRONE CROP LAND UNDER A CONSERVATION RESERVE PROGRAM
4akc020l WHAT HAPPENS NOW
4akc020m THAT DEPENDS ON TWO THINGS WHETHER MANAGEMENT CAN GAIN THE TRUST OF THE WORKERS AND WHETHER UNION LEADERS CAN CONTROL THE RANK AND FILE
4akc020n IT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD ON EITHER COUNT
4akc020o INDEED LABOR EXPERTS SAY THERE IS ONLY A SLIM CHANCE THAT SOUTH KOREA CAN LAY A FOUNDATION FOR LABOR RELATIONS THAT MIGHT CALM WORKER UNREST SOON
4akc020p THE DEBARTOLOS BASED ON THEIR PREVIOUS TAKEOVER ATTEMPTS HAVE THE FINANCIAL WHEREWITHAL TO MAKE A BID FOR ZAYRE

4akc020r THE DEBARTOLOS LOST OUT IN THE BIDDING FOR ALLIED TO CAMPEAU CORPORATION A TORONTO REAL ESTATE FIRM
4akc020s CARTER HAWLEY AVOIDED A TAKEOVER THROUGH A RESTRUCTURING
4akc020t NEVERTHELESS SOME ANALYSTS SAY THE FED ALREADY MAY BE TIGHTENING CREDIT SLIGHTLY
4akc020u THEY POINT TO RECENT INCREASES IN THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE WHICH IS THE RATE ON RESERVES THAT BANKS LEND EACH OTHER OVERNIGHT
4akc020v THE FUNDS RATE AVERAGED ABOUT SEVEN AND FIVE EIGHTHS PERCENT YESTERDAY AND TUESDAY UP FROM AN AVERAGE OF SEVEN POINT FOUR THREE PERCENT IN THE WEEK ENDED OCTOBER SEVENTH
4akc020w THESE ANALYSTS ARGUE THAT THE INCREASE WAS ENGINEERED BY THE FED
4akc020x ACTION FOR CHILDREN'S TELEVISION IS THE LEAD PARTY IN THE PETITION EVEN THOUGH THE F. C. C. SAID ITS TOUGHER POLICY IS AIMED AT PROTECTING CHILDREN FROM INDECENT FARE
4akc020y VIOLATING FREEDOM OF SPEECH ISN'T THE WAY TO PROTECT CHILDREN IN THIS COUNTRY
4akc020z IT'S LIKE BURNING BOOKS IN A LIBRARY SAID PEGGY CHARREN PRESIDENT OF THE CAMBRIDGE MASSACHUSETTS BASED ORGANIZATION
4akc0210 INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS LOOKING FOR SOME EXCITEMENT IN THEIR LIVES AREN'T LIKELY TO BE ENTHRALLED BY MR. BERG'S ADVICE
4akc0211 HE SUGGESTS THAT THEY DROP THEIR HARD EARNED DOLLARS INTO THE MOST CONSERVATIVE OF INVESTMENTS T. BILLS AND SIT TIGHT
4akc0212 THERE'S NO SENSE TRYING TO PLAY GAMES WITH THIS MARKET MR. BERG EXPLAINS
4akc0213 A SIMILAR VIEW IS HELD BY GRETA E. MARSHALL INVESTMENT MANAGER OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC EMPLOYEES' RETIREMENT SYSTEM WHICH MANAGES ABOUT FORTY FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS
4akc0214 I STILL SEE NO EVIDENCE THAT INFLATION IS PICKING UP SUBSTANTIALLY SHE SAYS
4akc0215 THE ECONOMY DOESN'T LOOK SO STRONG THAT IT WILL REKINDLE INFLATION SO I WOULD VIEW ANY FURTHER DROP IN BOND PRICES AS A BUYING OPPORTUNITY
4akc0216 FOR THE NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN THIRD QUARTER THE MAGAZINE GROUP HAD PRETAX EARNINGS OF SIX POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS ON REVENUE OF FIFTY NINE POINT FIVE MILLION
4akc0217 THE EXPECTED EARNINGS DROP REFLECTS ONE FEWER ISSUE IN THE QUARTER OF FAMILY CIRCLE
4akc0218 ALSO THE COMPANY CITED DEVELOPMENT COSTS FOR THREE NEW MAGAZINES
4akc0219 THAT FIGHT WHILE REMARKABLE FOR ITS BITTERNESS TYPIFIES THE CORE PROBLEM IN THE NATIONWIDE PUSH TO CONTAIN MEDICAL COSTS WHO GETS LESS
4akc021a DOCTORS WANT TO MAINTAIN THEIR AUTHORITY AND THEIR INCOMES
4akc021b HOSPITALS ARE FIGHTING TO HANG ONTO REVENUE MORE THAN A THIRD OF WHICH COMES FROM MEDICARE
4akc021c AND PATIENTS DON'T WANT TO SEE SERVICES DECREASE
4akc021d BUT THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM NOW CONSUMES ABOUT ONE MILLION DOLLARS A MINUTE AND ALL AGREE IT NEEDS TAMING
4akc021e ANALYSTS SAY THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF REASONS WHY THE I. P. O.S ON ONE MARKET MIGHT OUTPERFORM THOSE ON ANOTHER OVER A PARTICULAR PERIOD
4akc021f FOR ONE THING SMALLER STOCKS HAVE OUTPERFORMED LARGER ISSUES FOR MUCH OF THE SPAN COVERED IN N. A. S. D.'S STATISTICS
4akc021g SO THAT PROBABLY HELPED THE NEW ISSUES ON THE O. T. C. MARKET WHICH ARE GENERALLY SMALLER THAN THOSE HEADED FOR THE BIG BOARD
4akc0301 IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SOME GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES C. I. A. HAD TO GIVE UP FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS
4akc0302 NOW IT IS SUGGESTED THAT OFFICIALS GIVE UP FIFTH AMENDMENT RIGHTS
4akc0303 IN NINETEEN NINETY SOMEONE IS GOING TO SUGGEST THAT GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS GIVE UP THEIR FOURTH AMENDMENT RIGHTS PROTECTING THEM FROM UNLAWFUL SEARCHES
4akc0304 WHY NOT
4akc0305 THEY MAY BE HIDING IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS IN THEIR HOMES
4akc0306 A LOS ANGELES BANKRUPTCY COURT MONDAY APPROVED ARGO'S PLAN OF REORGANIZATION
4akc0307 IN EXCHANGE FOR ITS INTEREST IN ARGO'S OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES SENECA SAID IT WILL REFINANCE SOME OF THE ARGO DEBT

4akc030a A SPOKESMAN FOR THE UTILITY UNIT SAID IN OUR MINDS THE PRIMARY ISSUE OF PREFERENCE WAS LAID TO REST BY THE COURT'S DECISION
4akc030b THE COMPANY SAID IT EXPECTS TO PREVAIL WHEN THE COMMISSION WEIGHS THE OTHER SECONDARY CONSIDERATIONS
4akc030c THIS IS A VICTORY FOR OUR CUSTOMERS ASSERTED THE SPOKESMAN ADDING THAT THE DAM PROVIDES OUR LOWEST COST SOURCE OF POWER
4akc030d SELLING THE CANADIAN BUSINESS WILL HELP T. L. C. GROUP COMPLETE ITS FINANCING ON THE REST OF BEATRICE INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS
4akc030e T. L. C. GROUP SAID YESTERDAY THAT IT HAS A FIRM COMMITMENT FROM DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT INCORPORATED ITS INVESTMENT BANKER TO FINANCE ITS ACQUISITION
4akc030f A DREXEL SPOKESMAN SAID HE EXPECTS THE FINANCING TO COME THROUGH A COMBINATION OF BANK LOANS AND HIGH YIELD BONDS
4akc030g DREXEL FINANCED THE KOHLBERG KRAVIS BUY OUT OF BEATRICE LAST YEAR
4akc030h DAVID FLEISCHER AN ANALYST AT PRUDENTIAL BACHE SECURITIES THINKS TENNECO BY NINETEEN NINETY OR NINETEEN NINETY ONE COULD EARN EIGHT DOLLARS A SHARE FROM EXISTING OPERATIONS
4akc030i THAT WOULD BE A SIXFOLD INCREASE FROM NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN PROFIT WHICH HE PUTS AT ONLY ONE DOLLAR TWENTY FIVE CENTS A SHARE
4akc030j TENNECO STANDS TO BENEFIT GREATLY FROM A PICK UP AT ITS OIL AND GAS AND FARM EQUIPMENT BUSINESSES HE SAYS
4akc030k IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER TO GET THESE POLICY CHANGES WITHOUT THE CHAOS OF A DECLINING MARKET SAYS HARVARD ECONOMIST LAWRENCE SUMMERS
4akc030l BUT IF THE MARKET GETS PEOPLE TO DO WHAT THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN DOING ANYWAY IT MIGHT HELP
4akc030m TO BE SURE THE STOCK CRASH DOES RAISE THE RISK OF RECESSION
4akc030n THE BENEFITS MENTIONED ABOVE WILL BE OVERWHELMED IF CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES ARE BADLY SHAKEN AND DECIDE TO SHARPLY REDUCE THEIR SPENDING
4akc030o AN UNUSUALLY WEAK CHRISTMAS BUYING SEASON OR WIDESPREAD SHELVING OF BUSINESS INVESTMENT PLANS COULD EASILY CAUSE THE MARKET'S PROBLEMS TO SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE ECONOMY
4akc030p WHETHER THAT HAPPENS DEPENDS FAR MORE ON PSYCHOLOGY THAN ECONOMICS
4akc030q WE EMPHATICALLY REJECT THE IDEA THAT THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH SUBVERTED THE LAW UNDERMINED THE CONSTITUTION OR THREATENED DEMOCRACY
4akc030r THE PRESIDENT IS EVERY BIT AS MUCH OF AN ELECTED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE PEOPLE AS IS A MEMBER OF CONGRESS
4akc030s IN FACT HE AND THE VICE PRESIDENT ARE THE ONLY OFFICIALS ELECTED BY THE WHOLE NATION
4akc030t STANLEY NABI EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT OF BESSEMER SAID THEY'RE NOT REDUCING THEIR OFFER IF YOU CALCULATE THE OFFER'S VALUE AS OF THURSDAY'S CLOSE
4akc030u I FIGURE IT WAS WORTH SIXTY FIVE DOLLARS AND EIGHTY FIVE CENTS A SHARE ON THURSDAY
4akc030v WITH FRIDAY'S REVISION IT'S WORTH SIXTY EIGHT DOLLARS A SHARE
4akc030w THE REVISED TERMS ARE NO LESS ATTRACTIVE THAN THE ORIGINAL TERMS IN THE POST CRASH MARKET

4akc0408 THE ISSUE IS SO SENSITIVE HERE SAYS BOND ANALYST DANIEL SCOTTO OF L. F. ROTHSCHILD UNTERBERG AND TOWBIN
4akc0409 <NOISE> WE ARE ALL CONCERNED THAT THE REGULATORS CAN SIT BACK AND WAIT FOR CREDIT TO CARRY THE COMPANY OUT INTO THE HORIZON

4alc0204 HE IS CREDITED WITH DRILLING THE PRESIDENTS OF TRUST COMPANY'S EIGHTEEN GEORGIA BANKS ON THOSE FUNDAMENTALS SETTING AMBITIOUS PROFIT TARGETS AND HOLDING THE BANKS STRICTLY ACCOUNTABLE FOR REACHING THEM

4alc0209 SHUWA SAYS IT ISN'T AIMING TO SELL TO INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS BUT TO INSTITUTIONS AND LARGE INVESTORS
4alc020a STILL THE SALES OFFICE IS UNUSUAL FOR INSTITUTIONAL BUSINESS MOREOVER IT WILL BE ON THE GINZA AN ADDRESS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH RETAIL SHOPPING
4alc020b THE ALTERED MEMO HOWEVER NEVER MENTIONED THE PRESIDENT
4alc020c INSTEAD IT RECOMMENDED ONLY THAT THE CURRENT DONORS BE APPROACHED TO PROVIDE FIFTEEN TO TWENTY MILLION ADDITIONAL

4alc020s I CURRENTLY HAVE TWENTY SIX CONVERSATIONS IN PROGRESS ALTHOUGH I CAN'T GUESS HOW MANY WILL PAN OUT HE SAID

4alc020u THE BENCHMARK CANADIAN NINE PERCENT BONDS DUE IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX WERE BID THIRTY BASIS POINTS LOWER
4alc020v THE EURODOLLAR BOND MARKET STILL HAS A LOT OF UNDERLYING STRENGTH SAID A SENIOR TRADER FOR ONE EUROPEAN BANK

4alc0213 NEW CAMPAIGN CO CHAIRMAN LAXALT MAY SERVE AS *INTERMEDIARY* WITH THE REAGANS EVEN AFTER EIGHT YEARS BUSH STILL FEELS AWKWARD TALKING TO THEM

4alc0215 ONE EXPLANATION THE DESIRE OF THE CHIEF OF STAFF *DUBERSTEIN* EARLIER VIEWED AS A DOLE SUPPORTER TO INTEGRATE HIMSELF WITH BUSH
4alc0216 MR. TAYLOR WILL REMAIN PRESIDENT A POST HE HAS HELD SINCE MAY FIRST

4alc0301 FOR KODAK A FIVE HUNDRED MILLION PENALTY WOULD REPRESENT ABOUT A DOLLAR FIFTY A SHARE AFTER TAXES
4alc0302 IT MIGHT BE SEEN AS A VICTORY FOR KODAK SAYS ALEX
4alc0303 BROWN *ANALYST* OTIS BRADLEY IN A RECENT REPORT
4alc0304 YESTERDAY KODAK CLIMBED TWO AND THREE QUARTERS TO SEVENTY FIVE AND THREE EIGHTHS
4alc0305 IT REPORTED FIRST QUARTER PROFIT ROSE TO SEVENTY NINE CENTS A SHARE FROM TWENTY TWO CENTS A SHARE
4alc0306 BUT THERE APPEAR TO BE SOME MAJOR CATCHES
4alc0307 MANY BANKS THAT CUT RATES HAVE SMALL NUMBERS OF CARDS OUTSTANDING
4alc0308 IN OTHER CASES LOWER RATES ARE AVAILABLE ONLY TO THE MOST CREDITWORTHY CUSTOMERS
4alc0309 AND CERTAIN RATE REDUCTIONS ARE BEING OFFSET BY HIGHER ANNUAL FEES AND ELIMINATION OF INTEREST FREE GRACE PERIODS
4alc030a NOW THE TWO UNITS ARE FOR SALE FOR FIFTY THOUSAND AND TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS MAYBE HALF THEIR PEAK VALUES OF THREE YEARS AGO

4alc030j DOES THAT MEAN A CABINET POST
4alc030k YEAH SAID MR. *IACOCCA*
4alc030l MAYBE
4alc030m MORE LIKELY THOUGH MR. *IACOCCA* WOULD PREFER TO BE PART OF AN INFORMAL GROUP OF PRESIDENTIAL ADVISERS

4alc0310 IT MAY TRY TO SEIZE STRONGHOLDS <NOISE> WHILE ALSO RELYING ON INSIDE AGENTS TO KILL OFFICIALS IN THE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT AND ITS INTELLIGENCE SERVICE THE KHAD
4alc0311 THE AIM WOULD BE TO DEMORALIZE OFFICIALS AND FORCE THEM INTO EXILE
4alc0312 MR. CONABLE'S OWN NATURE STILL ISN'T CLEAR REPRESENTATIVE LAFALCE ARGUES
4alc0313 BARBER CONABLE IS AN OUTSTANDING PERSON HE SAYS
4alc0314 HE HAD A STRONG IDENTITY HERE IN CONGRESS WHICH HE EARNED
4alc0315 BUT HE DOESN'T HAVE HIS OWN IDENTITY AS PRESIDENT OF THE WORLD BANK
4alc0316 HE WAS CREATED BY JIM BAKER AND GEORGE BUSH IN THIS JOB
4alc0317 HIS REPUTATION NOW REST ON HOW HE DEFINES HIMSELF
4alc0318 UNISYS PLACED SIX EMPLOYEES ON LEAVE WHILE THEY ARE BEING INVESTIGATED IN THE PENTAGON PROCUREMENT SCANDAL

4alc040h THE AGENCY SAID IN AN ORDER THAT THE STAFF RECOMMENDED ON AUGUST TWENTIETH THAT THE ONE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLAR SALE BE APPROVED
4alc040i BUT THE F. C. C. SAID IT WANTS TO REVIEW THE RECOMMENDATION AND HALTED THE SALE UNTIL IT CONCLUDES THAT REVIEW
4alc040j THE AGENCY DIDN'T SAY IN THE ORDER WHEN IT EXPECTS TO RULE BUT AN AGENCY SPOKESMAN SAID THAT A DECISION IS LIKELY WITHIN A MONTH
4alc040k DRAMS (IN-PARENTHESIS DYNAMIC RANDOM ACCESS MEMORIES ARE A PARTICULAR EXAMPLE
4alc040l OUR SYSTEMS GROUP USES THEM ALONG WITH OUR OWN MICROPROCESSORS TO BUILD MICROCOMPUTER SYSTEMS
4alc040m EVEN THOUGH INTEL WAS THE FIRST MANUFACTURER OF SUCH DEVICES WE ALONG WITH MOST OTHER UNITED STATES MANUFACTURERS STOPPED MAKING THEM YEARS AGO

4alc040p FULL YEAR SALES ROSE FOURTEEN PERCENT TO SEVENTY ONE POINT SIX BILLION FROM SIXTY TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION
4alc040q THAT LARGE JUMP ENABLED FORD TO INCREASE ITS SHARE OF THE UNITED STATES NEW CAR MARKET TO TWENTY POINT TWO PERCENT FROM EIGHTEEN POINT TWO PERCENT
4alc040r THE COMPANIES SAID THEIR STRENGTHS ARE COMPLEMENTARY
4alc040s VAN KASPER CONCENTRATES ON GROWTH COMPANIES AND BIRR WILSON FOCUSES ON FIXED INCOME SECURITIES
4alc040t THE COMBINED OPERATION WILL SERVE MORE THAN FORTY THOUSAND INDIVIDUAL AND INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS

4amc0204 MR. MEESE ANNOUNCED THAT THE DIVERSION WAS UP TO THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS
4amc0205 THE CORRECT FIGURE TURNED OUT TO BE ABOUT THREE MILLION DOLLARS BUT THIS WAS A COMPARATIVELY SMALL MISTAKE
4amc0206 THE BIG PROBLEM WAS THAT IN ITS HASTE TO RUSH THE STORY OUT THE WHITE HOUSE NEVER THOUGHT THROUGH ITS OWN POLITICAL LEGAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL POSITION <NOISE>
4amc0207 OF COURSE THE ADMINISTRATION HAD MADE MISTAKES AND NOW HAD TO GET THE STORY OUT
4amc0208 <NOISE> BUT IT DIDN'T NEED TO ROLL OVER

4amc020p THE REPORT DOESN'T PREDICT ANY IMMINENT CRASH
4amc020q <NOISE> INDEED ITS DETAILED ANALYSIS CITES SEVERAL POSITIVE FACTORS
4amc020r SOLID USER DEMAND GENERATED BY HONG KONG'S ROBUST ECONOMY AND RISING INCOMES IS ONE FACTOR
4amc020s ANOTHER IS HEAVY INVESTMENT INFLOWS FROM JAPAN AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND CHINA AND TAIWAN

4amc020x HUNDREDS OF YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WILL EVALUATE WHAT THEY SEE THERE
4amc020y THEY WILL BEGIN TO QUESTION AND TO READ AND TO THINK

4amc030b DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS SAID THEY UNDERSTAND THAT MR. DEAVER NO LONGER REPRESENTS THE COMPANY <NOISE> ADDING THAT HE WASN'T INVOLVED IN ANY DISCUSSIONS WITH THE AGENCY BEFORE THE COURT ACTION
4amc030c WHERE CAN WE FIND SOME CLUES TO THE ANSWER OR AT LEAST A POSSIBLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION
4amc030d I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WE LOOK AT ONE MARXIST LENINIST STATE THAT ALREADY HAS GONE QUITE FAR DOWN THE REVISIONIST ROAD
4amc030e I REFER TO THE CURIOUSLY NEGLECTED INSTANCE OF YUGOSLAVIA
4amc030f THOSE LANDS HAVE BECOME WORTH MUCH MORE THAN THE TRANSPORTATION AND ENERGY CONCERN NEEDS FOR THE RAILROAD <NOISE> AND THE COMPANY HAD BEEN TRYING TO FREE ITSELF FROM THE FROM THE LIENS

4amc030l <NOISE> PAST SOCIETAL BIAS ISN'T SUFFICIENT BASIS TO JUSTIFY THE PLAN THE APPEALS COURT SAID IN AN OPINION WRITTEN BY JUDGE J. HARVIE WILKINSON THE THIRD

4aoc030h WHATEVER WE THINK ABOUT THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT IN IRAN IT IS AMONG THE PLANET'S MOST VITAL TERRITORIES
4aoc030i <NOISE> OUR SHARED ENEMY HAS FIVE DIVISIONS ON IRAN'S NORTHERN BORDER
4aoc030j THIS LOOMING SOVIET PRESENCE THREATENS NOT JUST AFGHANISTAN SOUTH OF SOVIET UNION AND EAST OF IRAN BUT THE PERSIAN GULF
4aoc030k THE WARM WATER PORT THE CZARS DREAMED OF IS WITHIN REACH
4aoc030l WE WILL HAVE A LOT MORE THAN SOME KUWAITI TANKERS TO WORRY ABOUT IF THE SOVIETS GET THEIR PAWS ON THE OIL SPIGOT TO WESTERN EUROPE AND JAPAN
4aoc030m IN SHORT THE FALL OF IRAN TO THE *AYATOLLAH* WAS BAD NEWS FOR THE WEST THE FALL OF IRAN TO THE SOVIETS WOULD BE UNTHINKABLE
4aoc030n IN INTERVIEWS AND SPEECHES MR. ROH HAS SHOWN A GOOD GRASP OF THE ISSUES KOREA'S NEXT PRESIDENT FACES
4aoc030o HE TAKES NORTH KOREA FOR THE SERIOUS THREAT THAT IT IS
4aoc030p NATIONAL SECURITY IS A BIG CONCERN FOR SOUTH KOREANS AND IF THEY THINK MR. ROH CAN BEST PROVIDE IT THAT'S A PERFECTLY GOOD REASON TO VOTE FOR HIM
4aoc030q MR. ROH ALSO FAVORS A FREER ECONOMY TO KEEP SOUTH KOREAN DEVELOPMENT ROLLING
4aoc030r <NOISE> NOT LONG AFTER THE NORTHWEST ANNOUNCEMENT THE INSTITUTE WIRED A PRESS RELEASE TO MEDIA ORGANIZATIONS DETAILING THE LARGE NUMBER OF PASSENGER COMPLAINTS ABOUT NORTHWEST'S SERVICE

4aoc030w MANY ECONOMISTS BELIEVE THAT AT THE VERY LEAST THE UNDERLYING TREND CONTINUES TO CALL FOR GRADUAL IMPROVEMENT
4aoc030x BUT THE BIGGEST STUMBLING BLOCK MAY BE THE MANAGERS THEMSELVES
4aoc030y MANY OF THEM CAN'T HANDLE CRITICISM FROM SUBORDINATES
4aoc030z IN FACT EVEN PROPONENTS ACKNOWLEDGE THAT MANY MANAGERS WHO RECEIVE APPRAISALS JUST SHOVE THE RESULTS IN A DRAWER

4aoc0316 HE DENIED INDUSTRY SPECULATION THAT F. N. N. IS LOOKING TO SELL THE COMPANY
4aoc0317 WE'RE NOT INTERESTED IN SELLING AND WE'RE NOT SOLICITING ANYTHING HE SAID
4aoc0318 HOWEVER HE ADDED THAT'S NOT TO SAY WE WOULDN'T ENTERTAIN ANY REASONABLE OFFER FOR AT LEAST A PIECE OF F. N. N.
4aoc0319 NONE OF THIS MEANS JAPANESE INDUSTRIAL MANAGEMENT WILL BE TRANSFORMED OVERNIGHT
4aoc031a <NOISE> CHANGE WILL COME SLOWLY BECAUSE JAPANESE SOCIETY STILL HAS A L- STRONG TENDENCY TO HAMMER DOWN ANY NAIL THAT STICKS UP
4aoc031b THERE MAY BE A GROWING JAPANESE SELF CONFIDENCE IN JAPAN BUT THERE ARE RELATIVELY F:EW JAPANESE ENTREPRENEURS

4aoc0409 R. M. J. SENIOR OFFICIALS WHO OWN FORTY NINE POINT NINE PERCENT OF THE BROKER'S EQUITY WOULD CUT THEIR HOLDINGS TO TEN PERCENT
4aoc040a RATES ARE DETERMINED BY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PURCHASE PRICE AND FACE VALUE
4aoc040b THUS HIGHER BIDDING NARROWS THE INVESTOR'S RETURN WHILE LOWER BIDDING WIDENS IT
4aoc040c THE PERCENTAGE RATES ARE CALCULATED ON A THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY DAY YEAR WHILE THE COUPON EQUIVALENT YIELD IS BASED ON A THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE DAY YEAR
4aoc040d HOURLY COMPENSATION AT *NONFINANCIAL* FIRMS ROSE AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF THREE PERCENT IN NOMINAL TERMS BUT FELL ZERO POINT EIGHT PERCENT WHEN ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION

4aoc040l EVEN SOME SUPPORTERS NOW SAY PRIVATELY THAT HE SHOULD AIM FOR THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION
4aoc040m BUT HIS LONGTIME HOSTILITIES WITH DOLE LEAVE A SPOT ON A BUSH TICKET AS ABOUT THE ONLY POSSIBILITY
4aoc040n YESTERDAY PEOPLE CLOSE TO FEDERATED'S BOARD SAID THAT THE COMPANY WAS STILL OPEN TO YET ANOTHER FRIENDLY MERGER PROPOSAL FROM CAMPEAU

4aoc040x BESIDES HE ADDS NEW YORKERS COME HERE ALL THE TIME WE JUST WOULDN'T WANT THEM TO LIVE HERE
4aoc040y THE POLITICAL OBSTACLES TO REFORM ARE FORMIDABLE
4aoc040z AUSTERITY IS AN UNCOMFORTABLE WORD ESPECIALLY FOR POLITICIANS
4aoc0410 BUT THOUGH REFORM IS ESSENTIAL IF THE DEBTOR COUNTRIES ARE TO HAVE AN ECONOMIC FUTURE
4aoc0411 A LARGE PART OF THE *THIRD* *WORLD* DEBT IN VENEZUELA IT WAS NINETY PERCENT WENT TO FINANCE CAPITAL FLIGHT
4aoc0412 UNTIL THE COUNTRIES CAN PERSUADE THEIR OWN CITIZENS TO INVEST AT HOME NEW CAPITAL FROM ABROAD ISN'T LIKELY TO RUSH IN OR ULTIMATELY TO BE VERY USEFUL
4aoc0413 PETER DAPUZZO HEAD OF RETAIL TRADING AT SHEARSON LEHMAN HUTTON ALSO LOOKS FOR A SHARP UPWARD MOVE IN STOCK PRICES GIVEN A FEW IFS
4aoc0414 ONE IS IF INVESTORS DON'T GET SPOOKED AT THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE CRASH
4aoc0415 ANOTHER IS IF THE FEDERAL RESERVE EASES INTEREST RATES
4aoc0416 AND A THIRD IS IF GEORGE BUSH WINS THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION

4aoc0419 THE COURT ORDER DOESN'T AFFECT HUNDREDS OF OTHER COMPANIES THAT ARE CHALLENGING THE TAX IN STATE COURT BUT AREN'T INVOLVED IN THE FEDERAL CASE
4aoc041a GETTING THE DEAL RIGHT IS THE KEY
4aoc041b UNLIKE WARRANTS ON THE JAPANESE STOCK DEALS FOR U. S. COMPANIES AREN'T REALLY COVERED BY THE OWNERSHIP OF UNDERLYING SHARES
4aoc041c INSTEAD UNDERWRITERS USE WHAT THEY CALL A DYNAMIC HEDGE

4apc040w KENNETH SAFIAN PRESIDENT OF SAFIAN INVESTMENT RESEARCH NEW YORK NOTED TWO IMPORTANT TEMPERING INFLUENCES IN LOW OIL PRICES AND A STRONGER DOLLAR
4apc040x THE LONG TERM DIRECTION OF OIL PRICES HOWEVER LOOKED MUCH MORE UNCERTAIN LAST WEEK AFTER AN EXPLOSION AT A MAJOR NORTH SEA OIL PLATFORM SENT PRICES SOARING
4apc040y AND IT DOESN'T APPEAR THAT CABLE OWNERS WILL RESIST THE CHANGE
4apc040z A SPOKESMAN FOR THE NATIONAL CABLE TELEVISION ASSOCIATION SAID WE DON'T OPPOSE THE PROPOSAL IN PRINCIPLE
4apc0410 WE TAKE THE POSITION THAT THE MORE PEOPLE IN THE CABLE MARKET THE BETTER
4apc0411 WE'VE ALWAYS WONDERED HOW TO SQUARE NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA'S ROUGH WORDS WITH HIS SOFT TREATMENT IN THE DEMOCRATIC CONTROLLED U. S. CONGRESS
4apc0412 MAYBE HE HAS TOO BECAUSE HE'S UPPED THE ANTE
4apc0413 HE HAS NOW BRANDED NOT ONLY THE REPUBLICANS BUT ALSO THE DEMOCRATS AS IMPERIALISTS BECAUSE BOTH PARTIES HAVE TALKED RECENTLY ABOUT HELPING THE CONTRAS
4apc0414 WHAT DO THE DEMOCRATS BECOME IF THEY ACTUALLY VOTE THE BANDAGES
4apc0415 A SIMPLER WAY TO REDUCE BANK DEBTS THAT IS MORE ADVANTAGEOUS TO BORROWERS ARE STRAIGHT BUY BACKS IN THE GROWING SECONDARY LOAN MARKET
4apc0416 BUY BACKS HELPED CLEAR UP THE LATIN AMERICAN DEBT PROBLEMS IN THE NINETEEN THIRTIES
4apc0417 IN MARCH BOLIVIA BOUGHT BACK JUST UNDER HALF ITS SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS BANK DEBT AT ELEVEN CENTS FOR EACH DOLLAR OF DEBT
4apc0418 THAT CAUSED PROBLEMS THAT REACHED DOWN TO INDIVIDUAL FRANCHISES
4apc0419 IN THE EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTIES BURGER KING MANAGEMENT UNDER PRESSURE FROM PILLSBURY FRANCHISES SAID STARTED DEMANDING QUICKER RETURNS ON NEW LOCATIONS
4apc041a THAT MEANT BURGER KING FRANCHISES COULDN'T AFFORD SOME PRIME SPOTS THAT MCDONALD'S FRANCHISES GOT SAID MR. GARCIA
4apc041b S. E. C. CHAIRMAN DAVID RUDER PRESENTED THE UNANIMOUS POSITION OF THE FIVE MEMBER COMMISSION AT A MEETING YESTERDAY OF SECURITIES REGULATORS IN MELBOURNE AUSTRALIA
4apc041c MR. RUDER SAID THAT AN EFFECTIVE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR A GLOBAL MARKET SHOULD INCLUDE EFFICIENT SYSTEMS FOR DISSEMINATING MARKET DATA ON PRICES AND TRADING VOLUME AND FOR EXECUTING TRADES
4apc041d HE ADDED THAT ULTIMATELY ALL COUNTRIES SHOULD SET UP AUTOMATED SYSTEMS FOR CLEARING AND SETTLING EQUITY AND DEBT TRANSACTIONS AND THAT MANY SUCH SYSTEMS SHOULD BE LINKED
4aqc0201 BORG WARNER EASED THREE EIGHTHS TO FORTY ONE AND THREE EIGHTHS ON SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY NINE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SHARES
4aqc0202 MINSTAR AND BEAR STEARNS ENTERED INTO AN OPTION AGREEMENT FOR THE POSSIBLE PURCHASE OF THREE MILLION TWENTY NINE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED BORG WARNER SHARES
4aqc0203 THE PURCHASES WOULD BOOST MINSTAR'S BORG WARNER STAKE TO EIGHT POINT FIVE PERCENT
4aqc0204 YESTERDAY G. A. F. ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAS ACQUIRED A NINE POINT NINE SIX PERCENT INVESTMENT STAKE IN BORG WARNER
4aqc0205 BUT WHEN L. B. O. COMPANIES SELL STOCK THE BIG WINNERS USUALLY ARE A TIGHT CIRCLE OF EXECUTIVES AND INVESTMENT BANKERS WHO EARLIER BOUGHT CONTROL
4aqc0206 PROFITS OFTEN EXCEED TEN TIMES THESE INVESTORS' ORIGINAL STAKE
4aqc0207 THESE GIANT CONCENTRATED PAYOFFS FROM L. B. O.S ARE STARTING TO ANGER MAINSTREAM INVESTORS AND WORRY ACADEMICS
4aqc0208 MR. DAVIDOFF COULDN'T BE REACHED FOR COMMENT
4aqc0209 HIS LAWYER PAUL ROONEY SAID MR.
4aqc020a DAVIDOFF DEEPLY REGRETS HIS INVOLVEMENT IN THE BOESKY COMPANY'S FAILURE TO REMAIN AT ALL TIMES IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION'S NET CAPITAL RULES
4aqc020b MR. ROONEY EMPHASIZED THAT MR. DAVIDOFF WASN'T CHARGED WITH INSIDER TRADING
4aqc020c WILLFUL VIOLATION OF THE CAPITAL RULE CARRIES A MAXIMUM PENALTY OF FIVE YEARS IN PRISON AND A TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR FINE
4aqc020d IT IS A MISSION THAT REMAINS RELEVANT IN THE POST SEGREGATION ERA
4aqc020e MANY CURRENT MOREHOUSE STUDENTS WERE OFFERED SCHOLARSHIPS BY PREDOMINANTLY WHITE SCHOOLS BUT CAME HERE INSTEAD
4aqc020f FOR EXAMPLE ARCHIE RICH A DETROIT PAROCHIAL SCHOOL GRADUATE TURNED DOWN A DIVING SCHOLARSHIP FROM MICHIGAN'S OAKLAND UNIVERSITY IN FAVOR OF MOREHOUSE
4aqc020g I'VE ALWAYS FELT A STRONG RESPONSIBILITY TO THE BLACK COMMUNITY HE SAYS
4aqc020h THE EFFECT OF THE MERGER IS TO HAVE THE NEW PARENT INCORPORATED IN PENNSYLVANIA RATHER THAN OHIO
4aqc020i THE COMPANY SAID IT FAVORS CERTAIN CHANGES IN PENNSYLVANIA LAW REGARDING SUCH MATTERS AS THE LIABILITY OF CORPORATE DIRECTORS
4aqc020j THE MERGER IS EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED BY JULY THIRTY FIRST
4aqc020k CONSEQUENTLY LLOYD'S AND SOME BROKERS MAY BE FORCED TO INCREASE THEIR SHARE OF THE SETTLEMENT PAYMENT
4aqc020l YESTERDAY MINET HOLDINGS P. L. C. SAID ITS PLANNED TEN POINT FIVE MILLION POUND CONTRIBUTION COULD RISE TO TWELVE POINT FIVE MILLION POUNDS
4aqc020m LLOYD'S DECLINED TO SPECULATE ABOUT HOW MUCH ITS CONTRIBUTION MIGHT INCREASE
4aqc020n AT A MEETING WITH ANALYSTS ROBERT M. KAVNER A. T. AND T.'S CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER SAID IT APPEARS WE WILL HAVE A GOOD YEAR
4aqc020o BUT IN RESPONSE TO AN ANALYST'S QUESTION HE SAID EARNINGS OF TWO DOLLARS A SHARE SOUNDS STRONG
4aqc020p HE ALSO WARNED ANALYSTS AGAINST LOOKING AT A PARTICULAR QUARTER AND ISOLATING IT ADDING WE ARE LOOKING FOR THE ANNUAL TREND LINE
4aqc020q UNDER BANKRUPTCY LAW TEXACO ALONE CURRENTLY HAS THE RIGHT TO PROPOSE A REORGANIZATION PLAN FOR ITSELF
4aqc020r THAT RIGHT EXPIRES NEXT MONTH BUT TEXACO HAS ASKED JUDGE SCHWARTZBERG TO BLOCK PROPOSALS FROM ANY OTHER PARTIES UNTIL MARCH NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT
4aqc020s THE PENNZOIL SPOKESMAN SAID THE REORGANIZATION PLAN TO BE OUTLINED TODAY WOULD BE PRESENTED AS PART OF A MOTION OPPOSING TEXACO'S REQUEST FOR MORE TIME
4aqc020t BIDS TOTALING FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS WERE SUBMITTED
4aqc020u ACCEPTED BIDS RANGED FROM SEVEN POINT SIX EIGHT PERCENT TO SEVEN POINT SEVEN PERCENT
4aqc020v CITICORP SLATED ANOTHER FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR SALE NEXT TUESDAY
4aqc020w IN EXPORT LED ELECTRICAL AND COMPUTER MAKERS KYOCERA SLIPPED NINETY TO FIVE THOUSAND TWENTY
4aqc020x MATSUSHITA ELECTRIC INDUSTRIAL WAS UNCHANGED AT TWO THOUSAND SEVENTY
4aqc020y N. E. C. ROSE TEN TO ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND TEN
4aqc020z SONY ROSE TWENTY TO FOUR THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY
4aqc0210 HOWEVER PROFIT FROM FOREIGN TIRE OPERATIONS INCREASED THE COMPANY SAID
4aqc0211 SOUTH AMERICAN TIRE OPERATING PROFIT ROSE SIGNIFICANTLY BECAUSE OF HIGHER SALES AND BETTER MARGINS FIRESTONE SAID MORE THAN OFFSETTING A SLIGHT DECLINE IN EUROPE
4aqc0212 ALSO FOREIGN CURRENCY GAINS JUMPED TO SIX MILLION DOLLARS FROM ONE MILLION DOLLARS THE COMPANY SAID
4aqc0213 EVEN MODEST RETRENCHMENT WOULD MARK A STARK CONTRAST FROM FIDELITY'S HEADY GROWTH OF RECENT YEARS
4aqc0214 AT THE END OF NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE THE GROUP EMPLOYED ABOUT TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE AND HAD ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT OF AROUND TWENTY THREE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS
4aqc0215 WITHIN FOUR YEARS STAFFING GREW FOURFOLD
4aqc0216 ASSETS SWELLED TO AROUND EIGHTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS JUST BEFORE LAST OCTOBER'S CRASH
4aqc0217 STILL MR. LOVE THINKS HE HAS THE WORST BEHIND HIM
4aqc0218 PERMIAN HAS BOTTOMED OUT HE SAYS BUT HE'S USING INTERGROUP'S INVESTMENT BANKERS TO SOUND OUT PROSPECTIVE BUYERS ANYWAY
4aqc0219 TO BOLSTER THE BALANCE SHEET HE'S ALSO ATTEMPTING TO REACH AGREEMENT LATER THIS YEAR TO SELL TO JAPAN'S N. K. K. THE OTHER HALF OF ITS STEEL HOLDINGS
4aqc021a IT DOES NOT HOWEVER SEEM REASONABLE TO THE GERMANS WHO ARE INSTEAD MULLING A TAX INCREASE TO SHORE UP A LEAKY GOVERNMENT BUDGET
4aqc021b <NOISE> AS FOR THE U. S. COMMENTS ON GERMAN INFLATION A TYPICAL GERMAN MIGHT RESPOND ZERO INFLATION
4aqc021c WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT
4aqc021d MR. BROOKS'S ARTICLE AWAKENED MEMORIES OF MY TIME AS MR. HOOK'S STUDENT AT NEW YORK UNIVERSITY'S WASHINGTON SQUARE COLLEGE SOME TWENTY EIGHT YEARS AGO
4aqc021e ONE OF MR. HOOK'S MOST REMARKABLE PARABLES STILL STAYS FRESH IN MY MIND
4aqc021f HE TOLD OF AN OLD MAN DYING IN THE SPRINGTIME WHO CALLED HIS SONS TO HIS BEDSIDE
4aqc021g MY TREASURE HE SAID IS BURIED SOMEWHERE ON THIS FARM
4aqc021h YOU HAVE ONLY TO DIG TO FIND IT
4aqc021i HE DIED AND THE SONS WENT FOR THEIR SHOVELS
4aqc021j SURE ENOUGH THAT AUTUMN THEY FOUND AND SHARED THE TREASURE
4aqc021k THIS WAS SIDNEY HOOK'S PARALLEL FOR THE ADVANTAGES OF DEMOCRACY
4aqc0301 S. D. I. PERPETUATES THE ILLUSION THAT MORE WEAPONS EQUALS MORE SECURITY
4aqc0302 OUR DEPENDENCE UPON VIOLENCE TO RESOLVE CONFLICT IS A SHORT RUN SOLUTION TO A LONG TERM PROBLEM
4aqc0303 IN ORDER TO ENSURE OUR SURVIVAL WE MUST CHANGE THE WAY WE THINK ABOUT CONFLICT
4aqc0304 BY SPENDING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON DEVELOPING NONVIOLENT MEANS OF RESOLVING CONFLICT WE CAN BUILD A WORLD BEYOND WAR AND A SUSTAINABLE SECURE FUTURE FOR ALL PEOPLE
4aqc0305 THE IRAN CONTRA PANEL'S BIG SCENE GOT OFF WITH A BANG YESTERDAY
4aqc0306 LIEUTENANT COLONEL OLLIE NORTH WAS SWORN IN AND BRENDAN SULLIVAN JUNIOR HIS LAWYER PROMPTLY SET OUT TO PROVE THAT WITNESSES CAN TALK BACK AT A CONGRESSIONAL HEARING
4aqc0307 HE ACCUSED THE COMMITTEE OF WORKING HAND IN GLOVE WITH THE SPECIAL PROSECUTOR THREATENING TO INDICT HIS CLIENT AND USING DIRTY TRICKS BESIDES
4aqc0308 GROSSMAN'S INCORPORATED AN OPERATOR OF HOME IMPROVEMENT STORES SAID IT IS OFFERING ELEVEN MILLION COMMON SHARES ON A BEST EFFORT BASIS AT EIGHT DOLLARS EACH
4aqc0309 GROSSMAN'S CLOSED AT EIGHT DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS UP THIRTY SEVEN AND A HALF CENTS IN NATIONAL OVER THE COUNTER TRADING YESTERDAY
4aqc030a GROSSMAN'S PROCEEDS WILL BE USED TO BUY ITS THIRTEEN PERCENT AND FOURTEEN PERCENT DEBENTURES THE *COMPANY* SAID
4aqc030b OF THE TOTAL STOCK OFFERING ABOUT SIX POINT ONE MILLION SHARES ARE BEING OFFERED BY THE BRAINTREE MASSACHUSETTS BASED COMPANY AND THE REST BY HOLDERS
4aqc030c SHEARSON LEHMAN BROTHERS INCORPORATED IS THE SELLING AGENT
4aqc030d THE IRAN CONTRA COMMITTEE ENDED ITS HEARINGS YESTERDAY IN A TORRENT OF MEMBERS' SPEECHES ABOUT LIES AND DECEIT
4aqc030e CONGRESS NOW TURNS TO ITS REWRITE OF THE GRAMM RUDMAN LAW WHICH HAD TARGETED THE FISCAL NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT DEFICIT AT A HUNDRED AND EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS
4aqc030f THE TARGET WILL BE RAISED BECAUSE MEMBERS IT SEEMS ARE NOT PREPARED TO KEEP THE SPENDING CUT PROMISES MADE WHEN IT WAS SET
4aqc030g PETROLEUM HELICOPTERS INCORPORATED SAID IT PLANS TO OFFER TWO POINT SIX MILLION TO THREE MILLION SHARES OF ITS NONVOTING COMMON STOCK BEFORE YEAR END
4aqc030h THE PROVIDER OF HELICOPTER SERVICES FOR COMPANIES ENGAGED IN OFFSHORE OIL AND NATURAL GAS EXPLORATION SAID PROCEEDS WILL BE USED TO REDUCE LONG TERM DEBT
4aqc030i THE NEW ORLEANS COMPANY WOULDN'T IDENTIFY THE UNDERWRITERS
4aqc030j ANALYSTS SAID THE AGREEMENT HAS BEEN RUMORED FOR SOME TIME
4aqc030k HOWEVER THEY SAID IT WAS SOMEWHAT SURPRISING GIVEN THAT SAVANNAH ELECTRIC RECENTLY SAID IT WAS CONSIDERING FORMING A HOLDING COMPANY IN ORDER TO DIVERSIFY
4aqc030l A SAVANNAH ELECTRIC SPOKESMAN SAID THE ACQUISITION BY SOUTHERN WILL ALLOW THE COMPANY TO ACHIEVE SOME OF THE SAME RESULTS IN A MORE EFFICIENT MANNER
4aqc030m ABANDONING A NUCLEAR POWER PLANT COST A UTILITY A BUNDLE
4aqc030n BUT STATE REGULATORS APPROVED A RATE INCREASE TO COVER THE COSTS
4aqc030o NOW THE I. R. S. RULES THAT THE UTILITY IS ALSO ENTITLED TO A LOSS DEDUCTION FOR THE COSTS OF THE ABANDONED PLANT
4aqc030p ASKED ABOUT THE SITUATION A FIRST BOSTON SPOKESMAN SAID OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH CAMPEAU HAS NOT CHANGED
4aqc030q WE ARE CAMPEAU'S BANKER OF RECORD
4aqc030r OUR PEOPLE HAVE BEEN LIVING WITH BOB CAMPEAU FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS
4aqc030s BUT MANY CLUBS DON'T OFFER TEAM SPORTS AT ALL
4aqc030t THIS REFLECTS A GERMANIC DISTASTE FOR THE IDEA OF COMPETITION AS A GOAL IN ITSELF AND FOR THE AMERICAN PENCHANT FOR TURNING PRACTICALLY EVERYTHING INTO A CONTEST
4aqc030u BEAUTY PAGEANTS ARE RARE HERE HOSTILE TAKEOVERS ARE UNKNOWN IN THE BUSINESS WORLD AND THE GOVERNMENT STILL FIXES PRICES ON MANY PRODUCTS AND STRICTLY REGULATES STORE HOURS
4aqc030v AFTER HIS ORIENTATION MR. BOESKY WILL BE ASSIGNED A REGULAR JOB
4aqc030w THOUGH HE CAN STATE A PREFERENCE MR. SAMS SAID MR. BOESKY WILL GO WHERE THE PRISON NEEDS HIM
4aqc030x HE NOTED THAT MANY OF THE MOST DESIRABLE JOBS ARE SNAPPED UP BY INMATES WITH MORE SENIORITY
4aqc030y THE DESIRABLE JOBS MR. SAMS SAID ARE AT THE PRISON'S FACTORY WHICH MAKES WOODEN FURNITURE FOR FEDERAL OFFICES THE DAIRY FARM AND THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE
4aqc030z THE NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENT WOULD AFFECT EMPLOYERS WITH MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED EMPLOYEES BUT WOULD EXEMPT FALTERING COMPANIES WORKING TO AVERT A CLOSING
4aqc0310 IT WOULD REQUIRE EMPLOYERS TO GIVE WORKERS BACK PAY FOR EACH DAY OF NOTICE NOT GIVEN TO A MAXIMUM OF SIXTY DAYS' WAGES
4aqc0311 FOR PURPOSES OF COUNTING EMPLOYEES AN AMENDMENT APPROVED YESTERDAY WOULD REQUIRE THAT ONLY WORKERS WHO HAVE BEEN EMPLOYED FOR SIX MONTHS BE INCLUDED
4aqc0312 MR. POPEJOY SAID HE HASN'T HAD ANY REAL MEANINGFUL CONVERSATIONS WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF BASS GROUP ABOUT REMAINING AT AMERICAN SAVINGS
4aqc0313 HOWEVER HE ADDED I'M VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE BASS PEOPLE
4aqc0314 I THINK THEY'RE GOING TO DO GOOD THINGS WITH AMERICAN SAVINGS AND THEY WILL MAKE THIS COMPANY PROBABLY THE STRONGEST FINANCIAL INSTITUTION IN THE COUNTRY
4aqc0315 BUT THEY'VE MADE NO COMMITMENT TO ME NOR I TO THEM
4aqc0316 BUT MR. MCCONNELL IN RESPONSE SAID HE BELIEVED THAT AT LEAST SEVEN THOUSAND UNITS HAVE BEEN LOST SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY
4aqc0317 IN HIS EXPERIENCE OWNERS DO REGISTER UNITS EVEN IF THEY ARE EXEMPT FROM RENT CONTROL PRECISELY TO ESTABLISH THAT THEY ARE EXEMPT
4aqc0318 THOSE WHO WORK FOR THE RENT BOARD WILL TELL YOU THAT THERE HAS NOT BEEN A SUBSTANTIAL LOSS OF HOUSING HE SAID
4aqc0319 EVERYBODY ELSE IN TOWN WILL TELL YOU OTHERWISE
4aqc0401 STOCK PRICES TUMBLED AS INVESTORS BRACED FOR TOMORROW'S TRIPLE WITCHING HOUR
4aqc0402 THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIALS CLOSED DOWN SEVENTEEN POINT EIGHT FIVE POINTS AT NINETEEN EIGHTEEN POINT THREE ONE
4aqc0403 MEANWHILE SHORT TERM INTEREST RATES SURGED AS BANKS SCRAMBLED TO BORROW FUNDS TO MEET SEASONAL NEEDS
4aqc0404 THE SPOKESMAN SAID XEROX IS STILL NEGOTIATING WITH PERSONAL COMPUTER SUPPLIERS ON AN AGREEMENT TO REPLACE THE ONE WITH OLIVETTI THAT EXPIRED AT THE END OF LAST YEAR
4aqc0405 WE CONTINUE TO LOOK AT A NUMBER OF OPTIONS INCLUDING A RENEWED AGREEMENT WITH OLIVETTI HE SAID
4aqc0406 TACITLY ACKNOWLEDGING THAT SALES HAVE BEEN SLOWER THAN EXPECTED HE ADDED THAT WE HAVE ENOUGH INVENTORY TO LAST THROUGH ANY PERIOD OF TIME
4aqc0407 FURTHER CRITICISM CAME FROM DANTE DE OLIVEIRA WHO RESIGNED AS MINISTER FOR LAND REFORM IN PROTEST AT THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION TO INSIST ON A FIVE YEAR TERM
4aqc0408 HE AND MANY ASSEMBLYMEN BELIEVE A DECISION ON THE LENGTH OF THE PRESIDENTIAL MANDATE IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY ELECTED LAST NOVEMBER
4aqc0409 PRESIDENT SARNEY CAME TO POWER IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE FOR A SIX YEAR TERM UNDER AN ACCORD REACHED WITH THE FORMER MILITARY GOVERNMENT
4aqc040a WHAT THIS SHOW REALLY IS THEN IS AN HOMAGE TO THE LATE SPANISH MASTER
4aqc040b IF ONE ACCEPTS THE SHOW ON THAT BASIS IT IS SUCCESSFUL DESPITE ITS GAPS
4aqc040c IN FACT THE GREATER WEIGHT GIVEN MIRO'S EARLIER PAINTINGS WORKS TO ADVANTAGE HERE FOR MANY OF HIS BEST PICTURES WERE DONE BEFORE THE MID NINETEEN THIRTIES
4aqc040d AFTER THAT HIS WORK WAS SOMEWHAT UNEVEN
4aqc040e DETAILS OF THE NEW OFFER WEREN'T DISCLOSED
4aqc040f THE RAILWAYS HAVE BEEN SEEKING A WAGE FREEZE LOWER WAGES FOR STARTING EMPLOYEES AND OTHER CONCESSIONS REJECTED BY THE UNIONS
4aqc040g THE PREVIOUS CONTRACT EXPIRED DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST
4aqc040h THE UNIONS HAVE BEEN SEEKING A FIVE PERCENT WAGE RAISE IN EACH OF TWO YEARS MORE JOB SECURITY AND GUARANTEES AGAINST SUBCONTRACTING
4aqc040i THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT HEALTH DOESN'T REMAIN AN IMPORTANT ISSUE
4aqc040j GREYHOUND CORPORATION WHICH INSTITUTED A COMPANYWIDE SMOKING BAN LAST YEAR SAYS IT WON'T CONSIDER EXEMPTING THE NEW CIGARETTE FROM THE BAN UNLESS IT'S PROVED SAFE
4aqc040k AT GREYHOUND WE WON'T HAVE ANYTHING THAT IS HARMFUL TO EMPLOYEES' HEALTH ON THE PREMISE SAYS JOHN W. TEETS THE COMPANY'S CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
4aqc040l NO ONE HAS COME OUT AND SAID THIS IS A HEALTHY CIGARETTE
4aqc040m SEPARATELY PACIFIC LIGHTING COMPLETED THE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED SALE OF ITS LAND DEVELOPMENT SUBSIDIARIES TO TWO INVESTMENT GROUPS FOR THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS
4aqc040n THE SALE WILL RESULT IN A FOURTH QUARTER GAIN OF ABOUT TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS OR TWENTY CENTS A SHARE
4aqc040o THE COMPANY EARLIER HAD SAID IT EXPECTED TO POST THE GAIN FOR THE THIRD QUARTER
4aqc040p EDGAR S. WOOLARD DU PONT'S PRESIDENT AND CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER NURTURED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE VENTURE
4aqc040q <NOISE> HE SAYS DU PONT IS STILL VERY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT ITS PROSPECTS BUT HE ACKNOWLEDGES HURDLES THAT MUST BE OVERCOME
4aqc040r THE REAL CHALLENGE HE SAYS IS WHETHER PHILIPS DU PONT OPTICAL CAN GET THERE AND STAY AHEAD
4aqc040s WITH TECHNOLOGY LIKE THIS THE COMPANY THAT INVENTED THE OVERNIGHT EXPRESS BUSINESS FOURTEEN YEARS AGO STILL DOMINATES IT
4aqc040t FEDERAL EXPRESS COLLECTS MORE THAN HALF THE REVENUE IN WHAT IS NOW MORE THAN A SIX BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY
4aqc040u AND AT A TIME WHEN DETERIORATING SERVICE IS A NATIONAL MALADY THIS COMPANY CLAIMS TO DELIVER MORE THAN NINETY NINE PERCENT OF ITS LETTERS AND PACKAGES ON TIME
4aqc040v THE CLINCHER CRITICS SAY IS THE COMPARISON WITH FORDS BUILT AFTER NINETEEN EIGHTY
4aqc040w FOR THEM THE DEATH COUNT IS DOWN AS MUCH AS FIVEFOLD AND MORE LIKE OTHER CARS'
4aqc040x FOR NINETEEN EIGHTY AND LATER VEHICLES FORD REDESIGNED CERTAIN TRANSMISSION PARTS
4aqc040y MR. HAMM WHO WAS HERE TO MEET WITH SOME OF HIS CLIENTS AMONG THE OPEC COUNTRIES SAID SUPPLY AND DEMAND IN THE OIL MARKET IS BALANCED
4aqc040z BUT HE SAID IT'S BALANCED AT FIFTEEN TO SIXTEEN DOLLARS A BARREL
4aqc0410 THAT IS TWO TO THREE DOLLARS A BARREL LESS THAN THE EXPORTERS WERE RECEIVING LAST YEAR
4aqc0411 IF THERE IS A REDUCTION IN SUPPLY AS A RESULT OF THE JOINT MEETINGS PRICES WILL SHOOT UP MR. HAMM SAID
4aqc0412 JUST BEFORE THE OCTOBER NINETEENTH GLOBAL EQUITIES CRASH HONGKONG BANK ECONOMISTS EXPRESSED SIMILAR CONCERN ABOUT THE SPECULATION THAT THEN DOMINATED THE LOCAL STOCK MARKET
4aqc0413 THEIR PROPERTY REPORT RECALLS THE EQUITIES CRASH AS A REMINDER THAT ASSET VALUES CANNOT DEFY GRAVITY FOR EVER
4aqc0414 THIS WARNING NOW REPRESENTS A MINORITY VIEW
4aqc0415 MR. RANDOL SAYS THE SHARP UPWARD TREND IN REFINER MARGINS IS UNUSUAL FOR THE MIDDLE OF THE DRIVING SEASON
4aqc0416 MARGINS HISTORICALLY HAVE PEAKED BY MID YEAR HE SAYS
4aqc0417 BUT U. S. GASOLINE STOCKS ARE CLOSE TO AN EIGHT YEAR LOW WHILE DEMAND HAS OUTSTRIPPED THE INDUSTRY'S PHYSICAL ABILITY TO MANUFACTURE UNLEADED FUEL HE SAYS
4aqc0418 THE SAME MENTALITY AFFECTED THE PHYSICAL STRUCTURES OF THE STORES MR. GARCIA SAID
4aqc0419 HE OWNS THIRTY SEVEN BURGER KINGS IN FLORIDA BUT HE REFUSES TO PUT UP THE BUILDING THAT IS CURRENTLY APPROVED BY BURGER KING
4aqc041a IT LOOKS LIKE A MATCHBOX
4aqc041b IN BETWEEN THE PURCHASERS' REPORT AND THE JOBS DATA THE GOVERNMENT WILL RELEASE A HALF DOZEN OTHER SERIES INCLUDING JUNE'S LEADING ECONOMIC INDICATORS INDEX
4aqc041c THAT INDEX COULD ADD TO RECESSION FEARS IF IT DECLINES AS EXPECTED
4aqc041d A DROP IN THE GOVERNMENT'S CHIEF ECONOMIC FORECASTING TOOL WOULD MARK THE FOURTH DECLINE IN FIVE MONTHS
4aqc041e A RULE OF THUMB AMONG ECONOMISTS HOLDS THAT THREE SUCCESSIVE DECLINES IN THE INDEX SIGNAL RECESSION
4arc0201 A SMALLER MARKET SHARE STILL MEANS SUBSTANTIAL GROWTH WHEN THE ASSET POOL IS VASTLY EXPANDED NOTES GEORGE COLLINS PRESIDENT OF T. ROWE PRICE
4arc0202 NONETHELESS THE FIRM HAS BEEN PAYING MORE ATTENTION TO THE CONSUMER ASPECTS OF THE BUSINESS
4arc0203 RETAIL CLIENTS CURRENTLY ACCOUNT FOR ABOUT FIFTY SEVEN PERCENT OF THE TOTAL TWENTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS OF ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT AT T. ROWE PRICE
4arc0204 IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT RETAIL BUSINESS ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT THIRTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE FIRM'S ASSETS
4arc0205 ME AND THE GUY I WAS FISHING WITH WERE FISHING ALONG SOME WEEDS NOT GETTING MUCH OF ANYTHING COOK RECALLS
4arc0206 I HOOKED A BIG ONE AND IT GOT AWAY
4arc0207 I THOUGHT UH OH THAT'S IT FOR ME TODAY
4arc0208 COUPLE MINUTES LATER THE EIGHT POUNDER HIT
4arc0209 JUST LUCKY I GUESS
4arc020a OVER NINE YEARS THE DRAMA HAS PLAYED OUT SOMEWHAT DIFFERENTLY THAN EITHER SIDE IMAGINED
4arc020b SOME GOVERNMENT SERVICES HAVE BEEN CUT BUT LOCAL OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN SKILLFUL IN FIGURING OUT NEW WAYS TO RAISE MONEY
4arc020c COURT RULINGS HAVE GIVEN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS MORE OPPORTUNITY THAN FIRST THOUGHT TO LEVY HIGHER TAXES
4arc020d AND THE STATE ECONOMY HAS REMAINED ROBUST SIDESTEPPING THE RECESSION THAT HAS CLOBBERED NEARBY ROCKY MOUNTAIN STATES AND THE OIL PRODUCING SOUTHWEST
4arc020e <NOISE> FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD SPOKESMAN JOSEPH COYNE SAID YESTERDAY'S ACTION WAS DONE ENTIRELY AT CITICORP'S INITIATIVE
4arc020f ALTHOUGH FED OFFICIALS WERE ADVISED OF THE BANK'S PLANS IT WAS THEIR OWN JUDGMENT OF WHAT KIND OF RESERVE POSITIONS THEY SHOULD MAKE MR. COYNE SAID
4arc020g WE DON'T CONSIDER THIS A PRECEDENT FOR OTHER BANKS
4arc020h THE EFFECT OF THE MERGER IS TO HAVE THE NEW PARENT INCORPORATED IN PENNSYLVANIA RATHER THAN OHIO
4arc020i THE COMPANY SAID IT FAVORS CERTAIN CHANGES IN PENNSYLVANIA LAW REGARDING SUCH MATTERS AS THE LIABILITY OF CORPORATE DIRECTORS
4arc020j THE MERGER IS EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED BY JULY THIRTY FIRST
4arc020k MR. ICAHN COULDN'T BE REACHED FOR COMMENT AND IT WAS UNCLEAR WHAT INTENTIONS HE MIGHT ULTIMATELY HARBOR TOWARD TENNECO
4arc020l HIS POSITION IN THE COMPANY IS UNDERSTOOD TO BE ONE OF MORE THAN TWENTY SIMILAR STAKES HE HAS AMASSED IN A VARIETY OF CONCERNS
4arc020m AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED HE ALSO CONTROLS AN ELEVEN POINT FOUR PERCENT STAKE IN U. S. X. CORPORATION A PITTSBURGH BASED OIL AND STEEL CONCERN
4arc020n THE ADDED INVESTMENT COMES AT A TIME OF CONTINUING RED INK AT THE TELEVISION VENTURE AND AMID WIDESPREAD SPECULATION THAT NEWS CORP. WAS PLANNING TO REDUCE ITS INVESTMENT
4arc020o IN THE YEAR ENDED JUNE THIRTIETH SATELLITE TELEVISION POSTED A PRETAX LOSS OF FIVE POINT SIX NINE MILLION POUNDS ON REVENUE OF EIGHT MILLION POUNDS THE SPOKESWOMAN SAID
4arc020p IT IS POSSIBLE THAT NEWS INTERNATIONAL MAY CUT ITS STAKE SHE SAID
4arc020q CHASE PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED THE SALE OF ITS COMPUTER SERVICES COMPANY INTERACTIVE DATA CORP. AND OFFICES IN PARIS
4arc020r AMONG OTHER ASSETS CHASE IS CONSIDERING FOR SALE ONE NEW YORK PLAZA A LOWER MANHATTAN OFFICE BUILDING
4arc020s BIDS ON THAT ARE DUE IN MID APRIL
4arc020t BUT AT ANOTHER OPERATION IN RURAL NORTHERN ILLINOIS THERE ARE HARDLY ANY MINORITIES TO DRAW FROM
4arc020u WE PICKED THAT LOCATION BECAUSE WE NEEDED THE RIVER ACCESS THERE TO BE SUCCESSFUL MR. THOMPSON SAYS
4arc020v I KNOW I HAVE A SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
4arc020w BUT I ALSO HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO MY SHAREHOLDERS
4arc020x BUT SENATOR DAVID BOREN DEMOCRAT FROM OKLAHOMA THE CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE WAS LESS OPTIMISTIC
4arc020y THIS IS NO WAY TO BEGIN A RELATIONSHIP UNDER A TREATY AS IMPORTANT AS THIS IF THESE DELIBERATE AMBIGUITIES REMAIN HE TOLD REPORTERS
4arc020z SENATOR COHEN ALSO SAID H- HE IS LESS OPTIMISTIC THAT THE U. S. SOVIET DIFFERENCES CAN BE RESOLVED QUICKLY
4arc0210 I JUST WANTED TO TAKE A MINUTE TO THANK YOU FOR RUNNING ALEXANDER COCKBURN'S VIEWPOINT COLUMN
4arc0211 HIS COLUMNS OFTEN PROVIDE A FRESH SLANT ON THE MAJOR ISSUES OF THE DAY
4arc0212 HIS IDEAS ARE OFTEN CONTRARY TO POPULAR OPINION BUT THEY PROVIDE NEW IDEAS TO BROADEN THE READER'S OWN PERSPECTIVE
4arc0213 MR. ABANTO BRIEFLY SUCCEEDED IN RAISING GOLDMAN'S PROFILE AMONG THE TOP FIVE U. S. UNDERWRITERS OF CORPORATE BONDS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE
4arc0214 BUT SINCE THEN THE FIRM HAS TRAILED ITS MAIN RIVALS
4arc0215 LEAGUE TABLES AREN'T THAT IMPORTANT TO US SAID MR. RUBIN
4arc0216 THE FIRM THAT'S NUMBER FIVE OR NUMBER SIX CAN BE JUST AS EFFECTIVE AS THE FIRM THAT'S NUMBER ONE OR NUMBER TWO
4arc0217 <NOISE> THE FINANCIAL TIMES THIRTY SHARE INDEX FELL SEVENTEEN POINT FIVE POINTS TO ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY NINE POINT FOUR
4arc0218 VOLUME WAS A LIGHT THREE HUNDRED SIXTY SIX POINT FOUR MILLION SHARES
4arc0219 THE ONE HUNDRED SHARE INDEX WAS OFF NINETEEN POINT SIX AT EIGHTEEN HUNDRED FORTY FOUR POINT EIGHT
4arc021a THE DISCOUNT DEPARTMENT STORE OPERATOR SAID THE CHANGE WILL REFLECT A WRITE DOWN OF FIXED ASSETS INVENTORY DISPOSAL AND SEVERANCE PAY IN RELATION TO THE STORE CLOSING
4arc021b THE STORE WHICH HAS ABOUT FORTY EMPLOYEES WILL CLOSE IN EARLY JANUARY
4arc021c THE COMPANY SAID DUE TO THE STORE'S ABOVE AVERAGE SIZE AND THE LEVEL OF SALES VOLUME IT HAS DEVELOPED THE STORE HAS NOT BEEN PROFITABLE
4arc021d INSTITUTIONAL ACCOUNTS HAVE TRADED ACTIVELY THIS WEEK TRADERS SAID
4arc021e <NOISE> SOME MONEY MANAGERS ARE PURSUING UNDERVALUED STOCKS SUCH AS TECHNOLOGY ISSUES WHILE OTHERS MAY BE STANDING ASIDE OR SELLING
4arc021f THE RESULT HAS BEEN HEAVY VOLUME A LARGE AMOUNT OF BLOCK TRADING AND NARROW SPREADS BETWEEN BUYING AND SELLING PRICES
4arc021g TODAY'S EMPLOYMENT REPORT FOR JULY COULD LAUNCH ANOTHER DAY OF HEAVY TRADING IF IT CONTAINS EVIDENCE OF A SHARP SLOWDOWN IN ECONOMIC GROWTH
4arc021h ESTIMATES ARE THAT NON FARM PAYROLLS ROSE ABOUT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT THOUSAND LAST MONTH AND THAT THE CIVILIAN UNEMPLOYMENT RATE WAS UNCHANGED AT FIVE POINT THREE PERCENT
4arc0301 AMONG THE UNANSWERED QUESTIONS DID MESSRS.
4arc0302 BOESKY OR STEINBERG RECEIVE INSIDE INFORMATION ABOUT THE SECRET MERGER TALKS
4arc0303 DID THEIR LARGE POTENTIALLY UNFRIENDLY POSITIONS IN HARRIS ENCOURAGE HARRIS OFFICIALS TO COMPLETE A SALE
4arc0304 WERE THEY WORKING TOGETHER SEPARATELY OR IN CONCERT WITH DREXEL OFFICIALS TO BRING ABOUT A SALE OF HARRIS
4arc0305 VISITS TO BOTH COUNTRIES HOWEVER LEAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE STRUGGLE WILL BE LONG
4arc0306 FOR DEBT IN BRAZIL AS IN MEXICO IS ONLY ONE SIDE OF THE EQUATION
4arc0307 THE OTHER IS FINDING THE RESOURCES AND THE WILL TO OVERCOME A MIRE OF POVERTY AND IGNORANCE
4arc0308 AND IN BOTH COUNTRIES THIS MIRE COULD ULTIMATELY PROVE POLITICALLY EXPLOSIVE
4arc0309 U. S. LAWMAKERS WHO ARE SYMPATHETIC TO ISRAEL ARE EXPECTED TO REACT TO THE REPORT BY PUBLICLY PRAISING ISRAEL FOR ITS RECENT STEPS
4arc030a HOWEVER THESE LEGISLATORS ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE DETAILS THAT MIGHT BE INCLUDED IN THE REPORT
4arc030b ALSO SINCE MILITARY CONTRACTS BETWEEN JERUSALEM AND PRETORIA ARE SECRET AND IT ISN'T KNOWN WHETHER THE PACTS CONTAIN RENEWAL CLAUSES IT WILL BE DIFFICULT TO MONITOR ISRAELI COMPLIANCE
4arc030c THERE ARE CLEAR LIMITS TO GLASNOST
4arc030d SOME RELAXATION OF CONTROLS OVER RELIGIOUS EXPRESSION IS EVIDENT BUT NOT MUCH
4arc030e RADIO LIBERTY QUOTES A GORBACHEV SPEECH TO UZBEK PARTY LEADERS WARNING AGAINST PARTICIPATION BY PARTY MEMBERS IN RELIGIOUS CEREMONIES
4arc030f HE DOES NOT TAKE A BENIGN VIEW OF THE RISE OF ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISM ALONG SOVIET BORDERS
4arc030g IT'S UNCLEAR HOWEVER WHETHER THE TARGET COMPANY WILL SET A PATTERN SETTLEMENT BECAUSE FORD IS FAR MORE PROFITABLE THAN G. M.
4arc030h ONE INDICATION THAT PATTERN BARGAINING MAY BE BREAKING DOWN IS THE WIDE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO AUTO MAKERS' INITIAL PROPOSALS

4arc040r THEY'RE VERY INDEPENDENT AND VERY JADED
4arc040s ACADEMY MEMBERS HAVE SEEN THOUSANDS OF PICTURES HE ADDS AND YOU CAN'T HUSTLE THEM
4arc040t THEN THERE ARE DIFFERENCES IN HOW CORPORATE DIRECTORS ARE REQUIRED TO ACT
4arc040u IN BRITAIN DIRECTORS' LEGAL DUTY IS TO SHAREHOLDERS DUTCH LAW OBLIGATES DIRECTORS TO PROTECT THE COMPANY'S INTEREST INCLUDING EMPLOYEES CUSTOMERS AND CREDITORS
4arc040v DUTCH LAW IS SO HOSTILE TO UNFRIENDLY BIDS THAT NONE HAS SUCCEEDED THERE SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY
4arc040w THE COST OF INSTALLING SPRINKLER SYSTEMS IS HIGH

4arc041a BUT SOME LED TO CHARGES OF CORRUPTION THAT ARE NOW BEING INVESTIGATED IN THE OPPOSITION CONTROLLED NATIONAL ASSEMBLY
4arc041b PRESIDENT ROH TAE WOO'S GOVERNMENT DOESN'T WANT TO PROVOKE SIMILAR SUSPICIONS NOR DOES IT WANT TO APPEAR TO BE SHORING UP ANOTHER FAILING COMPANY AT TAXPAYERS' EXPENSE

4asc0206 DOCTOR TEMPLE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE OPINION OF AN OUTSIDE ADVISORY COMMITTEE NOR WILL THE DECISION ON T. P. A. BE MADE BY THE OFFICE HE HEADS
4asc0207 HE ALSO RELIED HEAVILY ON ADVERTISING RATHER THAN ON DIRECT MAILING WHICH IS BY FAR THE MOST COMMON WAY FOR NEWSLETTER PUBLISHERS TO SOLICIT SUBSCRIBERS
4asc0208 THIS UNUSUAL STRATEGY EVOLVED FROM A SMALL AD PLACED IN A BUSINESS MAGAZINE
4asc0209 THE NINE HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLAR AD GENERATED ENOUGH SUBSCRIPTIONS TO PAY FOR ITSELF IN A WEEK SO MR. KOBREN BEGAN ADVERTISING IN OTHER PUBLICATIONS
4asc020a OF HIS COMPANY'S ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN OPERATING EXPENSES LAST YEAR FULLY HALF WENT FOR MARKETING

4asc020q OMAN SUDAN AND SOMALIA DIDN'T CUT RELATIONS WITH EGYPT
4asc020r JORDAN AND DJIBOUTI DID BUT HAVE SINCE RESTORED RELATIONS
4asc020s FOR TWO YEARS AFTER HIS NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE ELECTION HE PUT INTO EFFECT THE SOCIALIST PROGRAM OF FAST REFLATION AND WHOLESALE NATIONALIZATION
4asc020t AS INFLATION SOARED AND THE FRANC NOSE DIVED HIS APPROVAL RATING PLUNGED
4asc020u THEN HE CHANGED COURSE COMPLETELY
4asc020v HIS NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE AUSTERITY PROGRAM WAS APPLAUDED BY EVEN HIS RIGHT WING OPPONENTS
4asc020w AFTER NAMING FOUR COMMUNISTS TO HIS ORIGINAL CABINET HE BROKE WITH THE COMMUNISTS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR AND DESTROYED THEM AS A POLITICAL FORCE
4asc020x WE NEVER HAD ONE BEFORE MR. TIMBERS SAID
4asc020y A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF OUR CLIENTS WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THAT OPTION
4asc020z IT'S NOT NECESSARILY A MARKET CALL
4asc0210 MR. TIMBERS SAYS HE'S FAIRLY AMBIVALENT ABOUT THE PRICE OF GOLD NEAR TERM
4asc0211 HE DOES SEE HOWEVER HIGHER INFLATION OF FIVE PERCENT OR SO IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE UP FROM FOUR PERCENT THIS YEAR
4asc0212 A GOLD OPTION COULD BE A NICE ALTERNATIVE FOR FIXED INCOME INVESTORS SHOULD INFLATION FEARS ARISE MR. TIMBERS SAYS
4asc0213 RATES ON SHORT TERM TREASURY BILLS ALSO WERE LITTLE CHANGED
4asc0214 THE RATE ON THE LATEST THREE MONTH BILL FELL TO FIVE POINT SEVEN ONE PERCENT BID FROM FIVE POINT SEVEN TWO PERCENT WEDNESDAY
4asc0215 BUT THE RATE ON THE LATEST SIX MONTH BILL CLIMBED TO SIX POINT OH FOUR PERCENT BID FROM SIX POINT OH THREE PERCENT
4asc0216 THE BILL WHICH IS EXPECTED TO BE ENACTED IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS ALSO WOULD PREVENT STATES FROM SETTING OTHER CREDIT CARD DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS
4asc0217 BANKERS HAD SOUGHT THAT TO AVOID HAVING TO MEET A PLETHORA OF DIFFERING DISCLOSURE STANDARDS
4asc0218 WE'RE VERY HAPPY WITH THE PRE EMPTION SAID BARBARA MUNSON MANAGER OF CONGRESSIONAL RELATIONS FOR THE CONSUMER BANKERS ASSOCIATION A TRADE GROUP
4asc0219 THEY LIKE MANY DEALERS BLAME V. W.'S DECLINE ON MR. PHILLIPS AND HIS LOW PROFILE STYLE OF MANAGEMENT
4asc021a BUT JACK PRICE AN ALBUQUERQUE NEW MEXICO V. W. DEALER SAID MR. PHILLIPS'S CALM APPROACH HELPED LEAD THE COMPANY THROUGH ITS DIFFICULT TIMES
4asc021b HIS DEFENDERS ALSO NOTED THAT MANY EUROPEAN AUTO MAKERS HAVE STRUGGLED IN THE U. S. RECENTLY BECAUSE OF THE DECLINING VALUE OF THE DOLLAR
4asc021c MR. PHILLIPS WAS UNAVAILABLE TO COMMENT ON HIS JOB CHANGE YESTERDAY COMPANY OFFICIALS SAID
4asc021d IN PHILIPS SUN HAS WON A EUROPEAN ALLY THAT IT HOPES WILL PROVIDE AN EDGE OVER COMPETITORS
4asc021e MOTOROLA INCORPORATED M. I. P. S. COMPUTER SYSTEMS INCORPORATED AND HEWLETT PACKARD COMPANY ARE JOCKEYING TO WOO COMPUTER MAKERS TO THEIR OWN R. I. S. C. CHIPS
4asc021f THE CHIPS ARE RAPIDLY GAINING POPULARITY AMONG COMPUTER MAKERS AND THE ONE THAT GETS THE MOST CONVERTS COULD BECOME A DE FACTO STANDARD IN TOMORROW'S COMPUTER INDUSTRY
4asc0301 THE COURT HAS ORDERED MR. WARD AND GUINNESS'S FORMER CHAIRMAN ERNEST SAUNDERS TO RETURN THE MONEY
4asc0302 IT ALSO HAS FROZEN AS MUCH AS EIGHT POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS OF THEIR ASSETS
4asc0303 BUT THE TWO MEN'S LAWYERS ARE ASKING THAT THE ORDER GRANTED TEMPORARILY BE LIFTED PENDING THE OUTCOME OF A FULL TRIAL
4asc0304 THE COURT WAS SPLIT ON BOTH THE WILLIAMS ACT AND COMMERCE CLAUSE
4asc0305 JUSTICE LEWIS POWELL ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO CASE OF EDGAR VERSUS
4asc0306 M. I. T. E. SUGGESTED THAT ANY STATE LAW THAT FAVORED TARGETS MORE THAN DID THE WILLIAMS ACT WOULD BE INVALID BECAUSE CONGRESS HAD PREEMPTED LOCAL REGULATIONS
4asc0307 THE COURT BACKTRACKED HERE TO SAY STATE LAWS MIGHT BE O. K. IF THEY HELP THE WILLIAMS ACT'S PURPOSE BY HEAPING EVEN MORE BURDENS ON ACQUIRERS
4asc0308 HE TOOK THE TAG NUMBER OF THEIR CAR MR. CLIFTON RECALLED REFERRING TO MR. MCGEE
4asc0309 AND HE CAME AND GOT ME AND SAID HEY THIS IS THE REAL THING
4asc030a IT'S NOT A FLUKE
4asc030b IT APPEARS TO BE TRUE
4asc030c CANCELED SERIES INCLUDE THE COLBYS WEBSTER AND MR.
4asc030d BELVEDERE
4asc030e ONE OF THE NETWORK'S PRIME TIME NEWS PROGRAMS OUR WORLD ALSO WAS CANCELED
4asc030f BUT AT LEAST ONE DEFENSE INDUSTRY ANALYST CALLED THE PRICE SOMEWHAT STINGY
4asc030g IT'S FAIR BUT ON THE LOW END OF WHAT I WOULD CONSIDER THE REASONABLE RANGE SAID ROBERT M. HANISEE OF SEIDLER AMDEC SECURITIES OF LOS ANGELES
4asc030h WHEN I HEARD THE PRICE I WAS SHOCKED
4asc030i I THOUGHT IT WOULD SELL IN THE LOW THIRTIES
4asc030j HOURLY COMPENSATION AT NONFINANCIAL FIRMS ROSE AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF THREE PERCENT IN NOMINAL TERMS BUT FELL POINT EIGHT PERCENT WHEN ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION
4asc030k SECOND QUARTER HOURLY COMPENSATION ROSE AT AN ANNUAL NOMINAL RATE OF TWO POINT SIX PERCENT BUT FELL TWO POINT TWO PERCENT ON AN INFLATION ADJUSTED BASIS
4asc030l UNIT LABOR COSTS INCREASED AT A ZERO POINT FOUR PERCENT YEARLY RATE IN THE THIRD QUARTER AFTER A TWO PERCENT RATE OF GAIN IN THE SECOND QUARTER
4asc030m YET HE STRIVES TO REASSURE CANADA'S MIDDLE CLASS CALLING HIMSELF A SCANDINAVIAN STYLE SOCIALIST DEMOCRAT WHO APPRECIATES THE BENEFITS OF CAPITALISM
4asc030n THERE'S NO MINDLESS ATTEMPT TO SAY WE'RE GOING TO TAX PRIVATE CORPORATIONS OUT OF EXISTENCE HE SAYS
4asc030o THAT'S SILLY YOU DON'T DO THAT
4asc030p YOU WANT THEM TO DO WELL
4asc030q AT FIRST SOME MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS HAD RESERVATIONS ABOUT SUCH CORPORATE INITIATIVE
4asc030r A HOSPITAL OFFICIAL RECALLS THIS ATTITUDE YOU MAKE BEER CANS
4asc030s DON'T TELL US HOW TO PRACTICE MEDICINE
4asc030t LAST MONTH HOWEVER THE HOSPITAL STARTED TO DISCOUNT ROOM RATES FOR ALCOA EMPLOYEES
4asc030u IT ALSO AGREED TO USE MEDISGROUPS AND THEN DISCLOSE CERTAIN CLINICALLY RELATED DATA TO THE COMPANY
4asc030v AND MANY DOCTORS AT THE HOSPITAL HAVE AGREED TO CAP THEIR FEES
4asc030w WE'VE ALWAYS WONDERED HOW TO SQUARE NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA'S ROUGH WORDS WITH HIS SOFT TREATMENT IN THE DEMOCRATIC CONTROLLED U. S. CONGRESS
4asc030x MAYBE HE HAS TOO BECAUSE HE'S UPPED THE ANTE
4asc030y HE HAS NOW BRANDED NOT ONLY THE REPUBLICANS BUT ALSO THE DEMOCRATS AS IMPERIALISTS BECAUSE BOTH PARTIES HAVE TALKED RECENTLY ABOUT HELPING THE CONTRAS
4asc030z WHAT DO THE DEMOCRATS BECOME IF THEY ACTUALLY VOTE THE BANDAGES
4asc0310 HELPED BY WEDNESDAY'S WALL STREET RALLY AND IMPROVED COMMODITY PRICES STOCK PRICES POSTED ROBUST GAINS IN SYDNEY
4asc0311 TURNOVER REMAINED THIN

4asc0313 THEY DRIFTED FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE SESSION AND CLOSED JUST SHORT OF THEIR PEAKS
4asc0314 MR. MURRAY FORTY NINE YEARS OLD HAD BEEN SCHEDULED TO ASSUME THE POSTS OF CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE ON DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST
4asc0315 HE BECAME PRESIDENT IN JANUARY WHEN FLEET FINANCIAL GROUP MERGED WITH NORSTAR BANCORP
4asc0316 FLEET NORSTAR RETAINS HEADQUARTERS IN PROVIDENCE RHODE ISLAND AND IN ALBANY
4asc0317 WHERE DO YOU GO AROUND HERE TO HAVE A GOOD CRY SAID THE LIKABLE SEEMING THIRTY FIVE YEAR OLD IN THE PRESS TENT AFTERWARD
4asc0318 CHOKING BACK SOBS HE REMARKED IT'S ONLY A GAME RIGHT
4asc0319 WHEN ASKED HE SAID THAT EVEN THE OUTLET OF GOING HOME AND KICKING HIS DOG WASN'T AVAILABLE
4asc031a MY DOG'S JUST EIGHT WEEKS OLD HE EXPLAINED
4asc031b IN SOME CASES CONSUMERS CAN CHOOSE AMONG AS MANY AS FIFTEEN GENERIC VERSIONS OF A BRAND NAME PRESCRIPTION DRUG
4asc031c WE AREN'T PICKING ON ANY PARTICULAR MANUFACTURER SAID IRENE CARO ACTING F. D. A. DISTRICT DIRECTOR IN LOS ANGELES
4asc031d WE ARE JUST SELECTING A RANGE OF MANUFACTURERS WHO ARE MAKING THESE GENERIC PRODUCTS
4asc0401 THE F. D. P. IS THE ONE PARTY THAT HAS AT LEAST BEEN GRAPPLING SERIOUSLY WITH THE CONCEPT OF SUPPLY SIDE TAX CUTS
4asc0402 THE F. D. P.'S OTTO LAMBSDORFF A FORMER ECONOMICS MINISTER HAS HELPED MOVE THE F. D. P. AHEAD OF THE KOHL STOLTENBERG COMBINE ON THIS ISSUE
4asc0403 IN AN INTERVIEW LAST MONTH MR. LAMBSDORFF CALLED FOR CONSIDERABLE TAX CUTS WHICH HOPEFULLY CAN BEGIN IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
4asc0404 IDEALLY MR. LAMBSDORFF WOULD BE GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO ARGUE HIS VIEWS INSIDE THE GOVERNMENT
4asc0405 THE MOST RECENT TRIGGER PRICE FOR SUSPENDING QUOTAS ONE POINT FIVE ZERO ZERO EIGHT DOLLARS A POUND WAS EXCEEDED DECEMBER TWELVE NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE
4asc0406 QUOTAS WERE SUSPENDED IN FEBRUARY NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
4asc0407 NONETHELESS PRICES ROARED AHEAD THROUGH LAST WINTER TO PEAK MARCH FOURTEENTH AT TWO POINT OH EIGHT TWO NINE DOLLARS A POUND
4asc0408 THE TREASURY RULES HOWEVER CONTAIN MODIFICATIONS OF THE S. E. C. RULES DESIGNED TO IMPROVE PROTECTION OF PARTIES INVOLVED IN REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS
4asc0409 IN SUCH AGREEMENTS CALLED REPOS ONE PARTY SELLS GOVERNMENT SECURITIES TO ANOTHER WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THE SELLER *WILL* REPURCHASE THEM LATER AT A SPECIFIED PRICE
4asc040a THE PROPOSED MODIFICATIONS WOULD APPLY TO GOVERNMENT SECURITIES BROKERS OR DEALERS THAT ARE ALREADY REGISTERED AS WELL AS TO NEWLY REGISTERED ENTITIES
4asc040b MR. BOTHA !ALSO MUST RULE ON THE FATE OF THE GROUP AREAS ACT
4asc040c VIOLATIONS OF THE ACT ARE RAMPANT BUT THERE WERE ONLY FOUR PROSECUTIONS UNDER IT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX ONE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE AND NONE THE YEAR BEFORE
4asc040d A RECENT POLL BY THE AFRIKAANS NEWSPAPER RAPPORT FOUND THAT ONLY TWENTY SEVEN PERCENT OF SURVEYED WHITES WANT THE ACT RETAINED
4asc040e MORE THAN TWENTY FOUR PERCENT WANT IT SCRAPPED COMPLETELY WHILE ANOTHER THIRTY FOUR PERCENT WANT EACH LOCAL COMMUNITY OR PROPERTY OWNER TO DECIDE WHO CAN RENT OR BUY HOUSING <NOISE>
4asc040f WE'VE BEEN PONDERING THE SIXTEEN COUNT FEDERAL INDICTMENT RETURNED AGAINST CHRYSLER FOR DISCONNECTING ODOMETERS ON NEW CARS THAT ITS EMPLOYEES WERE TEST DRIVING
4asc040g MANY OF THE SOME SIXTY THOUSAND CARS AND TRUCKS WERE DRIVEN FOR UP TO FOUR HUNDRED MILES
4asc040h LEE IACOCCA HAS NOW CALLED THIS PRACTICE DUMB AND STUPID
4asc040i THAT DECISION IS LIKELY TO INTENSIFY THE POLITICAL HEAT ON NORWAY'S MINORITY LABOR PARTY GOVERNMENT
4asc040j LAST WEEK IT PUBLISHED A CRITICAL REPORT ON THE WORK AT MONGSTAD BUT STOPPED SHORT OF CALLING FOR RESIGNATIONS
4asc040k THE GOVERNMENT HAS SAID THE COST OF REPLACING SENIOR EXECUTIVES WOULD OUTWEIGH THE POSSIBLE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE ACTION
4asc040l FOUL WEATHER WAS ALSO BLAMED BY A SPOKESMAN FOR PAN AM THE FIRST PLACE FINISHER IN DECEMBER
4asc040m WEATHER PARTICULARLY AFFECTED FLIGHTS IN THE NORTHEAST AND EUROPE WHERE MOST OF PAN AM'S ROUTES ARE LOCATED HE SAID
4asc040n HE ADDED THAT PAN AM NONETHELESS TURNED IN ONE OF THE BEST PERFORMANCES AMONG MAJOR CARRIERS
4asc040o HE PREDICTED THE NEXT REPORT WILL SHOW A REBOUND FOR THE AIRLINE IN FEBRUARY
4asc040p THE NEXT OLYMPIC STOP IN SEPTEMBER IS SEOUL AND THERE IS REASON TO DOUBT IT WILL GO AS QUIETLY AS THE CALGARY GAMES
4asc040q SOUTH KOREA IS IN POLITICAL TURMOIL ITS OFFICIALS HAVE SAID THEY EXPECT TROUBLE FROM THEIR SPARRING PARTNERS TO THE NORTH AND THE U. S. FLEET WILL PATROL OFFSHORE
4asc040r UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES I CAN'T HELP THINKING THAT ANY AND ALL SECURITY MEASURES WILL BE WELCOME
4asc040s I GUESS IT'LL BE BETTER TO FEEL LIKE A TOOTHPASTE CARTON THAN TO GET SQUEEZED
4asc040t MR. EZELL GLANCES OUT HIS OFFICE WINDOW AT OLD GLORY AND THE I. N. S. FLAG SNAPPING IN THE OCEAN BREEZE
4asc040u I GUESS I'D LIKE TO GO BACK INTO THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND MAYBE RESCUE A TROUBLED COMPANY MR. EZELL SAYS
4asc040v LIKE LEE IACOCCA
4asc040w HE'S ANOTHER ONE OF MY HEROES
4asc040x ATTENDANTS IN SEARCH OF OTHER P. S. TWO CLONES HERE HAVE TO SCOUR CAREFULLY
4asc040y ACER INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION OF TAIWAN SHOWS A MACHINE BILLED AS COMPATIBLE WITH THE BOTTOM OF THE LINE P. S. TWO MODEL THIRTY
4asc040z THIS AVOIDS ALL THE LEGAL ISSUES AN ACER OFFICIAL PROMISES
4asc0410 BUT IT ALSO AVOIDS MOST OF THE NEW TECHNOLOGY IN THE P. S. TWO FAMILY
4asc0411 A TOUGHER ANTI NORIEGA POLICY NEED NOT LAUNCH A NEW ROUND OF U. S. MEDDLING ABROAD OR EVEN A GLOBAL ANTI DRUG CRUSADE
4asc0412 MANY GOVERNMENTS INVOLVED IN CRIMES AGAINST AMERICANS WILL ALWAYS REMAIN OUTSIDE AMERICA'S REACH
4asc0413 BUT THE U. S. HAS THE RIGHT AND THE POWER TO STOP GENERAL NORIEGA'S AGGRESSION AGAINST ITS YOUTH AND INNER CITIES
4asc0414 CONTINUING THE CURRENT POLICY OF WAFFLING IS A CONFESSION THAT FOR ALL AMERICA'S SQUAWKING OFFICIAL DRUG TRAFFICKING IS SOMETHING WE CAN LIVE WITH
4asc0415 THE GROUP HERE IN LIBERTY CENTER WAS RECRUITED BY A FARMER WHO PROMISED WORK FOR THREE MONTHS
4asc0416 WITH THE PROMISE NOW MEANINGLESS THE BAND HAS TAKEN REFUGE AT THE MIGRANT REST CENTER BEYOND THE USUAL THREE DAY LIMIT
4asc0417 FOR THAT KINDNESS THEY THANK MARIA RODRIQUEZ THE SIXTY SEVEN YEAR OLD FORMER MIGRANT WHO RUNS THE SHELTER
4asc0418 THEY CALL HER A SAINT SANTA MARIA
4asc0419 MR. BUSH WAS DISMISSIVE OF THE NATIONAL ECONOMIC COMMISSION A BIPARTISAN PANEL THAT IS STUDYING WAYS TO ATTACK THE DEFICIT
4asc041a MANY BUSINESS AND POLITICAL LEADERS SEE THE COMMISSION AS PROVIDING THE POLITICAL COVER NECESSARY FOR A NEW PRESIDENT TO DEAL EFFECTIVELY WITH THE DEFICIT PROBLEM
4asc041b BUT MANY CONSERVATIVES WORRY THAT COMMISSION MEMBERS WILL RECOMMEND A TAX BOOST AS PART OF A DEFICIT CUTTING PACKAGE
4asc041c IN SUM BOTH THE IMPROVEMENTS IN INCOME TO PERSONS AND THEIR DISTRIBUTION BEAR OUT NEITHER THE THESIS OF STAGNATION NOR DECLINE IN INCOME
4asc041d NOR ANY INCREASED POLARIZATION IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF INCOME
4asc041e QUITE THE OPPOSITE
4atc0201 ALTHOUGH SOME CABINET MEMBERS HAD BEEN EXPECTED TO STEP DOWN THE MASS ACTION TOOK MANY BY SURPRISE
4atc0202 <NOISE> MR. BENIGNO SAID TALK OF RESIGNING STARTED DURING A CABINET MEETING
4atc0203 ASKED WHAT CAUSED THE RESIGNATION OFFERS MR. BENIGNO SAID YOU'D HAVE TO INCLUDE THE ENTIRE PANORAMA OF EVENTS SINCE THE AUGUST TWENTY EIGHT COUP
4atc0204 I. R. E. HAS DOWNSIZED ITS REAL ESTATE SYNDICATION BUSINESS AND IS PRIMARILY A SAVINGS AND LOAN HOLDING COMPANY MR. LEVAN SAID
4atc0205 EARNINGS IN THE PAST WERE SOMEWHAT ERRATIC QUARTER TO QUARTER BECAUSE THE MAJOR BUSINESS WAS REAL ESTATE SYNDICATION
4atc0206 NOW THE S. AND L. HOLDING COMPANY IS THE MAIN BUSINESS WITH DOWN SIZED REAL ESTATE SYNDICATION
4atc0207 CORE EARNINGS ARE VERY CONSISTENT
4atc0208 NEVERTHELESS SOME ANALYSTS SAY THE FED ALREADY MAY BE TIGHTENING CREDIT SLIGHTLY
4atc0209 THEY POINT TO RECENT INCREASES IN THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE WHICH IS THE RATE ON RESERVES THAT BANKS LEND EACH OTHER OVERNIGHT
4atc020a THE FUNDS RATE AVERAGED ABOUT SEVEN AND FIVE EIGHTHS PERCENT YESTERDAY AND TUESDAY UP FROM AN AVERAGE OF SEVEN POINT FOUR THREE PERCENT IN THE WEEK ENDED OCTOBER SEVEN
4atc020b THESE ANALYSTS ARGUE THAT THE INCREASE WAS ENGINEERED BY THE FED
4atc020c ALONG WITH HIS PARTNER PHIL DILEO MR. KELLNER HAS BEEN REGARDED AS ONE OF WALL STREET'S BIGGEST AND BRIGHTEST MONEYMAKERS
4atc020d KELLNER DILEO STARTED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE WITH ONLY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AND REPORTEDLY HAS HAD AVERAGE ANNUAL GAINS OF SIXTY PERCENT BEFORE PAYOUTS TO LIMITED PARTNERS
4atc020e LAST YEAR THE FIRM IS SAID TO HAVE EARNED MORE THAN SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS
4atc020f ANALYSTS SAID THE AGREEMENT HAS BEEN RUMORED FOR SOME TIME
4atc020g HOWEVER THEY SAID IT WAS SOMEWHAT SURPRISING GIVEN THAT SAVANNAH ELECTRIC RECENTLY SAID IT WAS CONSIDERING FORMING A HOLDING COMPANY IN ORDER TO DIVERSIFY
4atc020h A SAVANNAH ELECTRIC SPOKESMAN SAID THE ACQUISITION BY SOUTHERN WILL ALLOW THE COMPANY TO ACHIEVE THE SOME OF THE SAME RESULTS IN A MORE EFFICIENT MANNER
4atc020i DEALERS SAID ACTIVITY WAS SLOW BECAUSE OF THE U. S. HOLIDAY CELEBRATING THE BIRTHDAY OF MARTIN LUTHER KING JUNIOR

4awc020z PRUDENTIAL'S CONSOLIDATED ASSETS ROSE FIVE POINT FOUR PERCENT TO ONE HUNDRED FORTY POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS FROM HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX

4awc0212 THE NORMALLY PLODDING SEARS IS NOW COPYING WARD'S SPECIALTY STORE SCHEME
4awc0213 ON WEDNESDAY IT AGREED TO BUY WESTERN AUTO SUPPLY COMPANY ITS THIRD SUCH VENTURE INTO SPECIALTY RETAILING IN RECENT MONTHS
4awc0214 LATER THIS YEAR SEARS PLANS TO OPEN SELF CONTAINED APPLIANCE AND HOME SHOPS TO COMPETE WITH WARD
4awc0215 SEARS IS ALSO FOLLOWING WARD'S FORAY INTO SELLING MORE BRANDED MERCHANDISE ESPECIALLY IN APPLIANCES
4awc0216 AND IT IS BRANCHING OUT OF MALLS TO OPEN SMALLER NEIGHBORHOOD STORES THAT COULD WHITTLE AWAY WARD'S CUSTOMER BASE
4awc0217 THE SHOCKER WAS THAT THE JUDGE HAD ORDERED A HUGE DAMAGE PAYMENT BEFORE CARBIDE'S LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES IF ANY HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED AT A TRIAL
4awc0218 AT FIRST GLANCE AT LEAST THE DECISION SEEMS TO VIOLATE ANY *DEFENDANT'S* FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO PRESENT EVIDENCE AND TO CROSS EXAMINE WITNESSES AGAINST IT
4awc0219 A CARBIDE SPOKESMAN HAS DECRIED THE RULING AS A JUDGMENT AND DECREE WITHOUT TRIAL
4awc021a IT'S A HUNDRED AND SEVEN DEGREES OUTSIDE AND THE LIGHTS IN THE RESTAURANT HAVE BEEN EXTINGUISHED TO CREATE THE ILLUSION OF COOLNESS
4awc021b CUSTOMERS ENTER WITH SWEAT POURING DOWN THEIR FACES
4awc021c THEY TAKE DESPERATE GULPS OF WATER AND DIG INTO THE DAILY SPECIAL A CURRY WITH VEGETABLE SIDE DISHES
4awc021d BUT IT'S WHAT THIS ELECTION IS ALL ABOUT
4awc021e THE REAL QUESTION ON THE BALLOT IS SHOULD THE REAGAN YEARS CONTINUE BEYOND THE REAGAN YEARS
4awc021f BEYOND THE BUSH YEAR(S)-
4awc021g BEYOND EVEN THE QUAYLE YEARS
4awc021h <NOISE> THE SUPREME COURT WILL DETERMINE THAT AND THE NEXT PRESIDENT WILL DETERMINE THE COURT'S MAKEUP FOR AT LEAST ANOTHER GENERATION
4awc0301 LOTS OF TIMES CARS WOULD TURN AROUND AND RUN BACK OVER THE SNAKE SAYS MR. SHEPHERD
4awc0302 THE MOST WAS FIVE TIMES
4awc0303 AND SOME PEOPLE STOPPED PUT THEIR WHEEL ON THE CREATURE AND ROLLED BACK AND FORTH
4awc0304 THE STUDENTS SAW OTHERS DRIVE UP ON THE ROAD'S SHOULDER
4awc0305 -ONCE A SHERIFF EVEN JUMPED OUT OF THE CAR AND PULLED A GUN BUT THE GROUP CAME OUT OF HIDING TO EXPLAIN
4awc0306 IN A LEVERAGED BUYOUT A GROUP OF INVESTORS BUYS A COMPANY AND TAKES IT PRIVATE USING MOSTLY BORROWED FUNDS TO FINANCE THE TRANSACTION
4awc0307 CASH FLOW AND OFTEN ASSET SALES ARE USED TO PAY DOWN THE DEBT
4awc0308 FOR INVESTORS THE APPEAL IS THE PROSPECT OF A BIG RETURN WHEN THE RESTRUCTURED COMPANY IS REFINANCED OR SOLD IN A FEW YEARS
4awc0309 DOUBLEDAY ALSO PROVIDED BERTELSMANN WITH A MUCH NEEDED U. S. BOOK MANUFACTURING OPERATION
4awc030a MOREOVER MR. VITALE SAYS IT'S WORTH A PREMIUM TO GET A FOOTHOLD IN THE U. S. MARKET
4awc030b <NOISE> IF YOU ARE IN PUBLISHING THE ONLY MARKET WITH LARGE NUMBERS IS THE ENGLISH SPEAKING MARKET HE SAYS
4awc030c THE PANEL'S BILL WOULD CONTINUE THE CURRENT EXEMPTION FROM LIABILITY FOR PRIVATE NUCLEAR CONTRACTORS HIRED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY TO PRODUCE MATERIAL FOR NUCLEAR WEAPONS
4awc030d <NOISE> AS IN THE PAST THE DEPARTMENT WOULD CONTINUE TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM AN ACCIDENT INVOLVING THEIR NUCLEAR ACTIVITIES
4awc030e <NOISE> BUT THE DEPARTMENT'S POTENTIAL LIABILITY WOULD BE RAISED TO SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS FROM THE CURRENT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS
4awc030f <NOISE> L. T. V. HAS SAID REPEATEDLY SINCE ITS FILING THAT IT WOULD FIGHT ANY CREDITOR MOVE TO EITHER REORGANIZE THE UNIT SEPARATELY OR FORCE ITS SALE
4awc030g CREDITORS ON THE OTHER HAND HAVE DISCUSSED THE IDEA ALMOST SINCE THE DAY OF L. T. V.'S FILING
4awc030h AND THE PENSION AGENCY THE BANKS AND THE COMMITTEE REPRESENTING UNSECURED CREDITORS HAVE RECENTLY BEEN HOLDING SERIOUS DISCUSSIONS ON THE ISSUE
4awc030i BY EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX KIMBERLY CLARK'S RESILIENCE WAS BEING TESTED AGAIN
4awc030j P. AND G. HAD BEATEN THE COMPANY TO THE MARKET WITH AN EXTRA THIN DIAPER CALLED ULTRA PAMPERS
4awc030k KIMBERLY CLARK POSSESSED THE NECESSARY TECHNOLOGY SUPER ABSORBENT POLYMERS WHICH REPLACED SOME OF THE BULKY STUFF AND WAS EVEN USING IT IN ITS ADULT INCONTINENCE PRODUCTS
4awc030l BUT THE COMPANY DELAYED ITS PLANS FOR THIN BABY DIAPERS WHEN RESEARCH SHOWED THAT THE PARENTS DIDN'T THINK DIAPERS WERE ABSORBENT UNLESS THEY DOUBLED THE SIZE OF A BABY'S BOTTOM
4awc030m BANC ONE CORPORATION COLUMBUS OHIO AGREED IN PRINCIPLE TO ACQUIRE UNIVERSAL CORPORATION A MICHIGAN BANK HOLDING COMPANY FOR STOCK VALUED AT THIRTEEN MILLION DOLLARS
4awc030n UNDER TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT UNIVERSAL SHAREHOLDERS WILL RECEIVE TWO SHARES OF BANC ONE COMMON FOR EACH OF THEIR SHARES
4awc030o UNIVERSAL THE PARENT OF THE NATIONAL BANK OF YPSILANTI HAS A HUNDRED AND SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN ASSETS AND EIGHT BRANCHES IN THE ANN ARBOR AREA
4awc030p UNIVERSAL WOULD BE THE FOURTH MICHIGAN BANKING CONCERN ACQUIRED BY BANC ONE A BANK HOLDING COMPANY
4awc030q INCLUDING UNIVERSAL BANC ONE'S MICHIGAN BANKS WOULD HAVE ASSETS OF ABOUT SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS
4awc030r BANC ONE HAS ASSETS OF SEVENTEEN POINT SEVEN FOUR BILLION DOLLARS
4awc030s MR. CAO HASN'T L- LOOKED BACK
4awc030t HE MAKES TWO THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS A YEAR PRODUCING HIS BUG ART ABOUT EIGHT TIMES THE AVERAGE CHINESE INCOME
4awc030u AND HIS SUCCESS HAS SPAWNED IMITATORS SOME OF WHOM ARE NOW T- SELLING THEIR WARES THROUGH THE FRIENDSHIP STORE
4awc030v FOR JACK MORRIS OF MINNEAPOLIS THE TAKEOVER BOOM HAS FINANCED HIS CHILDREN'S EDUCATION AND COST HIM HIS OLD JOB
4awc030w THE FORMER INVESTOR RELATIONS OFFICIAL AT GULF OIL CORPORATION OWNED A THOUSAND SHARES OF THE PITTSBURGH OIL GIANT

4awc0311 THE NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO A. B. M. TREATY REQUIRES A REVIEW EVERY FIVE YEARS
4awc0312 COMMUNIQUES ANNOUNCING COMPLETION OF THE FIRST AND SECOND REVIEWS WERE ISSUED ON NOVEMBER FOURTH NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN AND NOVEMBER NINTH NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO
4awc0313 THE THIRD REVIEW WAS DUE BY OCTOBER THIRD NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
4awc0314 THE MOST OPTIMISTIC ESTIMATES ARE NOW THAT IT WILL START SOMETIME AFTER THE FIRST OF THE YEAR
4awc0315 <NOISE> THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION IN SHORT IS CONSPIRING WITH THE SOVIETS TO VIOLATE THE REVIEW PROVISIONS OF THE TREATY
4awc0316 DEALERS SAID ACTIVITY WAS SLOW BECAUSE OF THE U. S. HOLIDAY CELEBRATING THE BIRTHDAY OF MARTIN LUTHER KING JUNIOR
4awc0317 MOST U. S. BANKS WERE CLOSED ALTHOUGH SEVERAL OF THE LARGER FOREIGN EXCHANGE DEPARTMENTS REMAINED OPEN TO SERVICE CORPORATE INSTITUTIONAL CUSTOMERS AND TRADE WITH EUROPE
4awc0318 <NOISE> BUT EVEN THEY WOUND DOWN THEIR TRADING WHEN THE LONDON MARKET SHUT DOWN AROUND NOON EASTERN STANDARD TIME OR AFTER THE CHICAGO FUTURES MARKET CLOSED LATER IN THE AFTERNOON
4awc0319 BUT RUTH HANDLER HASN'T LOST HER CREATIVE TOUCH
4awc031a <NOISE> AFTER UNDERGOING A MASTECTOMY IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SHE FOUND THAT NO ONE WAS PRODUCING SUITABLE PROSTHESES
4awc031b SO SHE DESIGNED HER OWN CALLED NEARLY ME AND THUS BEGAN ANOTHER SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS
4awc0401 INDEED TO INVESTORS ALL SHARES OF THE SAME STOCK ARE ALIKE THE INVESTOR DOESN'T CARE WHICH ONE HE BUYS
4awc0402 BUT TWO EXAMPLES OF THE SAME STAMP ISSUE CAN DIFFER GREATLY IN VALUE DEPENDING ON THE QUALITY OF SAY PERFORATIONS INK OR GLUE
4awc0403 BUYING STAMPS THROUGH A COMPUTER NETWORK SIGHT UNSEEN COULD BE HAZARDOUS
4awc0404 THE ACCORD MOST LIKELY WOULD INCLUDE SOME PRIVATE AGREEMENT AMONG MINISTERS ON HOW FAR UP OR DOWN THESE RATES CAN MOVE AND STILL BE ACCEPTABLE
4awc0405 BUT OFFICIALS SAID IT IS UNLIKELY THESE LIMITS WOULD *BE* *MADE* PUBLIC
4awc0406 AND IT ISN'T KNOWN YET WHETHER THE MAJOR POWERS WOULD PLEDGE TO INTERVENE IN CURRENCY MARKETS IF EXCHANGE RATES WERE TO EXCEED THOSE LIMITS
4awc0407 THERE IS A WIDE VARIATION IN THINKING ABOUT HOW SICK ONE IS AND HOW IMPORTANT TIME OFF IS IN ORDER TO GET WELL
4awc0408 THE PATIENTS' RESPONSIBILITIES OUTSIDE OF WORK ALSO VARY
4awc0409 <NOISE> IT'S HARD TO SAY TO WHAT DEGREE THESE FACTORS SHOULD INFLUENCE DISABILITY STATUS
4awc040a MOST PHYSICIANS PROBABLY CONSIDER THEM IMPORTANT
4awc040b BUT SOME FIND ELECTRONIC INVESTING ISN'T WORTH THE TROUBLE
4awc040c MR. JEFFERS ESTIMATES THAT A THIRD OF INVESTMENT SOFTWARE BUYERS EVENTUALLY JUNK THEIR PURCHASES BECAUSE THE TECHNOLOGY BAFFLES THEM
4awc040d <NOISE> AND WHILE SOME INVESTORS SAY COMPUTERS HAVE MADE THEM MONEY OTHERS HAVE SQUANDERED SMALL FORTUNES BECAUSE THEY RELIED TOO HEAVILY ON TECHNOLOGY
4awc040e THE DEPRESSION WASN'T JUST ONE LONG SLUMP AS THE POPULAR IMAGE HAS IT BUT A SERIES OF RECOVERIES ABORTED BY FURTHER RECESSIONS
4awc040f THESE SLUMPS WITHIN THE SLUMP IN NINETEEN THIRTY THREE AND NINETEEN THIRTY EIGHT WERE BOTH PRECEDED BY LARGE IN:COME TAX INCREASES
4awc040g THIS FOLLY HAS NOT PASSED UNNOTICED BY KEYNESIANS
4awc040h ROBERT STEIN EXCLAIMED IN HIS NINETEEN SIXTY NINE BOOK THE FISCAL REVOLUTION IN AMERICA
4awc040i WITH ONE EAR LAURA SLOATE LISTENS TO A MAN READING HEADLINES FROM SIX NEWSPAPERS
4awc040j WITH THE OTHER EAR SHE MONITORS AN AIDE READING HER MAIL
4awc040k MEANWHILE SHE IS KEEPING UP A CONVERSATION SORT OF
4awc040l MR. HAMM WHO WAS HERE TO MEET WITH SOME OF HIS CLIENTS AMONG THE OPEC COUNTRIES SAID SUPPLY AND DEMAND IN THE OIL MARKET IS BALANCED
4awc040m BUT HE SAID IT'S BALANCED AT FIFTEEN TO SIXTEEN DOLLARS A BARREL
4awc040n THAT IS TWO TO THREE DOLLARS A BARREL LESS THAN THE EXPORTERS WERE RECEIVING LAST YEAR
4awc040o IF THERE IS A REDUCTION IN SUPPLY AS A RESULT OF THE JOINT MEETINGS PRICES WILL SHOOT UP MR. HAMM SAID
4awc040p WE'VE ALWAYS WONDERED HOW TO SQUARE NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA'S ROUGH WORDS WITH HIS SOFT TREATMENT IN THE DEMOCRATIC CONTROLLED U. S. CONGRESS
4awc040q MAYBE HE HAS TOO BECAUSE HE'S UPPED THE ANTE
4awc040r HE HAS NOW BRANDED NOT ONLY THE REPUBLICANS BUT ALSO THE DEMOCRATS AS IMPERIALISTS BECAUSE BOTH PARTIES HAVE TALKED RECENTLY ABOUT HELPING THE CONTRAS
4awc040s WHAT DO THE DEMOCRATS BECOME IF THEY ACTUALLY VOTE THE BANDAGES
4awc040t UNITED ALSO DISPUTED CONTINENTAL'S ASSERTION THAT IT WOULD OFFER LOWER !FARES
4awc040u A SPOKESMAN SAID UNITED HAS TRIED SEVERAL TIMES TO REDUCE FARES TO JAPAN BUT HAS BEEN OPPOSED BY THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT WHICH FEARED INCREASED COMPETITION FOR ITS NATIONAL CARRIERS
4awc040v FARES BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES CAN BE CHANGED ONLY THROUGH BILATERAL AGREEMENT
4awc040w <NOISE> THAT NEWS SENT THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE ON A GIDDY RISE OF MORE THAN FIFTY POINTS
4awc040x BUT INVESTORS MAY NEED TO BE SHOWN MORE
4awc040y FRIDAY'S VOLUME AFTER SUBTRACTING A BIG DIVIDEND CAPTURE TRADE WAS ONLY MODERATE AT AROUND HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION SHARES
4awc040z <NOISE> F. P. L. SAID THE ACQUISITION WOULD BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS A POOLING OF INTERESTS
4awc0410 TURNER OWNS ABOUT TWELVE THOUSAND ACRES IN SOUTHWEST FLORIDA TEN THOUSAND OF WHICH ARE CITRUS GROVES
4awc0411 F. P. L. SAID THE ACQUISITION INCREASES ITS CITRUS ACREAGE TO TWENTY TWO THOUSAND
4awc0412 BECAUSE THE AUTO INDUSTRY'S GOOD TIMES ROLLED ON SO LONG EACH COMPANY ASSUMED THAT WHEN THE CRUNCH CAME THE OTHER GUY WOULD GET HURT
4awc0413 THAT WAS ESPECIALLY TRUE OF HONDA
4awc0414 FOR YEARS WHILE *RIVALS* DANGLED FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLAR REBATES AND INTEREST FREE LOANS BEFORE BUYERS HONDA STOOD ABOVE IT ALL
4awc0415 IT EFFORTLESSLY SOLD ALL THE CARS IT COULD MAKE IN THE UNITED STATES AND ALL IT COULD SHIP FROM JAPAN
4awc0416 THE FED REPORT GAVE NO HINT THAT MARKETS OF CAPITAL EQUIPMENT EXPECT DEMAND FOR THEIR WARES TO FALL OFF
4awc0417 <NOISE> PRODUCTION OF BUSINESS EQUIPMENT THOUGH REDUCED BY THE DROP IN AUTO AND TRUCK PRODUCTION GREW POINT TWO PERCENT IN JULY AFTER REMAINING FLAT IN JUNE
4awc0418 THE FED ATTRIBUTED THE INCREASE TO STEPPED UP PRODUCTION OF COMMERCIAL AND FACTORY EQUIPMENT AS WELL AS AIRCRAFT
4awc0419 OUTPUT OF INDUSTRIAL MATERIALS ALSO REBOUNDED IN JULY AFTER DROPPING FOR TWO MONTHS
4awc041a ONE NEW DIRECTORATE MEMBER ISN'T LIKELY TO CHANGE BUNDESBANK POLICY
4awc041b <NOISE> BUT BUNDESBANK WATCHERS EXPECT MR. TIETMEYER TO SIDE WITH MR. POEHL'S MONETARY POLICIES WHICH EMPHASIZE INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION OVER UNILATERAL ACTIONS
4awc041c OTHER COUNCIL MEMBERS HAVE FREQUENTLY CLASHED WITH MR. POEHL OVER HIS EFFORTS TO COORDINATE WEST GERMAN CURRENCY AND INTEREST RATE MOVES WITH OTHER CENTRAL BANKS
4awc041d DOING EVERYTHING PEOPLE WANT THE F. D. A. TO DO WOULD REQUIRE AN F. D. A. THE SIZE OF THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT HE SAYS
4awc041e BUT OVER THE LAST DECADE THE AGENCY HAS INSTEAD SHRUNK TO SEVEN THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED EMPLOYEES FROM EIGHT THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED
4awc041f THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION IS SEEKING A BUDGET AUTHORIZATION OF FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR A FIVE PERCENT INCREASE
4axc0201 WHETHER AND TO WHAT EXTENT STATES MAY REGULATE TAKEOVERS HAS BEEN A HOTLY CONTESTED LEGAL ISSUE EVER SINCE VIRGINIA PASSED THE FIRST STATE TENDER OFFER LAW IN NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT
4axc0202 BY NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO THIRTY SEVEN STATES HAD ADOPTED TENDER OFFER LAWS
4axc0203 BUT THAT YEAR THE SUPREME COURT STRUCK DOWN ILLINOIS'S LAW AS UNCONSTITUTIONAL IN A RULING THAT CAST DOUBT ON THE VALIDITY OF THE LAWS OF ALL THIRTY SEVEN STATES
4axc0204 IN THE CAREFREE DAYS BEFORE DEREGULATION IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT FIVE BIG AIRLINES HANDLED MOST OF THE PASSENGER TRAFFIC IN AND OUT OF LAMBERT SAINT
4axc0205 LOUIS INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT
4axc0206 THEN CAME THE AIR WARS
4axc0207 AFTER DECONTROL NINE OR MORE AIRLINES INVADED THE MARKET ALL TRYING TO LURE A SHARE OF THE TWENTY MILLION TRAVELERS WHO USE THIS AIRPORT EACH YEAR
4axc0208 THE RIVALS HAVE DISPUTED EACH OTHER'S CIRCULATION CLAIMS FOR YEARS
4axc0209 ACCORDING TO RECENT INDUSTRY STATISTICS THE POST'S DAILY CIRCULATION IS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND THE CHRONICLE'S APPROXIMATES FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND
4axc020a THE POST CLAIMS TO HAVE ROUGHLY FORTY PERCENT OF THE HOUSTON ADVERTISING MARKET
4axc020b THE COMPLEX PLAN GRADUALLY GIVES THE COMPANY TO THE DEBT HOLDERS SAID CHARLES E. BAYLESS FINANCIAL VICE PRESIDENT
4axc020c IN CONTRAST IF THE UTILITY BEGAN BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS THEY THE DEBT HOLDERS WOULD GET IT RIGHT NOW HE SAID
4axc020d IN EITHER CASE THE INTERESTS OF THE UTILITY'S COMMON SHAREHOLDERS WOULD BE SUBSTANTIALLY DILUTED HE SAID
4axc020e NOR IS THE NEW CHAIN'S ETHNIC MOTIF MEANT TO IMPLY CULINARY ADVENTURE
4axc020f RESEARCH SHOWS THAT MANY CONSUMERS THINK ITALIAN FOOD HAS TOO MUCH BASIL AND GARLIC SO SUCH INGREDIENTS ARE USED SPARINGLY
4axc020g OLD WORLD CREATIVITY IN THE KITCHEN GIVES WAY TO LASER BEAM PRECISION LOCAL CHEFS AREN'T ALLOWED TO IMPULSIVELY ADD A DASH OF ANYTHING
4axc020h DINERS AREN'T LIKELY TO CONSIDER THEIR MEALS MEMORABLE THE COMPANY CONCEDES
4axc020i BUT AT LEAST THEY WON'T BE ASKING WHAT'S THIS WEIRD S- TASTING STUFF SAYS MR. THOMPSON
4axc020j A NEW CONFERENCE BOARD SURVEY OF ONE THOUSAND SENIOR EXECUTIVES SHOWS CONFIDENCE UP SHARPLY
4axc020k THIS IS THE BIGGEST RISE IN CONFIDENCE SENTIMENT IN OVER A YEAR SAYS STEVEN MALIN SENIOR ECONOMIST
4axc020l OTHERS REPORT SIMILAR FINDINGS
4axc020m A RECENT DUN AND BRADSTREET CORPORATION SURVEY SHOWS SALES EXPECTATIONS FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL IN THREE YEARS
4axc020n THE NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT BUSINESS SAYS TWENTY THREE PERCENT OF SMALL BUSINESSES SURVEYED EXPECT CONDITIONS TO IMPROVE IN THE NEXT SIX MONTHS ONLY FOURTEEN PERCENT EXPECT A DECLINE
4axc020o <NOISE> TAX TALK BY JAMES BAKER AND HOWARD BAKER RILES ADMINISTRATION CONSERVATIVES
4axc020p IF THE PRESIDENT SIGNS OFF ON SIGNIFICANT TAXES THERE'LL BE A LOT OF SCREAMING AND SHOUTING SAYS A WHITE HOUSE AIDE
4axc020q BUT DESPITE THE RHETORIC ANY TAX BILL ACCEPTED BY THE WHITE HOUSE IS LIKELY TO DO LITTLE TO REDUCE THE RED INK
4axc020r SEVERE NEW TAXES PROPOSED BY THE HOUSE ON TAKEOVERS ALSO APPEAR DOOMED
4axc020s LINCOLN HAS ABOUT TWO MILLION COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING
4axc020t YESTERDAY IN COMPOSITE *TRADING* ON THE AMERICAN S- STOCK EXCHANGE LINCOLN CLOSED AT ELEVEN DOLLARS ONE TWENTY FIVE A SHARE UP TWELVE POINT FIVE CENTS
4axc020u BASED ON THAT PRICE LINCOLN'S COMMON SHARES HAVE A TOTAL MARKET VALUE OF ABOUT TWENTY TWO POINT TWO MILLION
4axc020v BUT WITH THE IMPORTED DOGS CAME PROBLEMS
4axc020w ONE WAS COST
4axc020x WHENEVER THEY STRAY FROM THE COUNTRY'S COOL CAPITAL THE NORTHERN BRED DOGS NEED AIR CONDITIONED ACCOMMODATION
4axc020y SPECIAL VEHICLES HAVE BEEN BUILT TO SQUIRE THEM AROUND
4axc020z EACH DOG NEEDS A TRAINER
4axc0210 <NOISE> A COOK PREPARES THE DOG CHOW
4axc0211 UPKEEP RUNS TO ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS A MONTH PER CANINE TRIPLE THE SALARIES OF THE TRAINERS
4axc0212 LAWRENCE KUDLOW OF BEAR STEARNS AND COMPANY DISAGREES WITH THE NOTION THAT THE ECONOMY HAS ENTERED A RECESSION
4axc0213 BUT HE EQUALLY DISAGREES WITH THE IDEA THAT INFLATION PRESSURES WILL SURGE
4axc0214 ALL THIS TALK ABOUT THE ECONOMY OVERHEATING AND HIGHER INFLATION IS COMPLETELY MISPLACED HE SAID
4axc0215 IT'S A SNARE AND A DELUSION
4axc0216 <NOISE> THE TOKYO FOREIGN STOCK EXCHANGE MARKET IS CLOSED ON SATURDAYS
4axc0217 <NOISE> EUROPEAN STOCK MARKETS WERE CLOSED FRIDAY AND SATURDAY EXCEPT MILAN WHERE PRICES EDGED UP IN FRIDAY'S SESSION
4axc0218 THE MILAN STOCK INDEX CLOSED UP SEVEN LIRE AT TEN SIXTY SIX
4axc0219 THE FED'S POSTURE THROUGH ALL OF THIS IS REMARKABLY SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE WILLIAM MCCHESNEY MARTIN FED OF THE MID NINETEEN FIFTIES
4axc021a THERE WAS NEVER ANY QUESTION ABOUT <*MR.*> MR. MARTIN'S PRIORITIES HE WAS FIRST OF ALL AN INFLATION FIGHTER AND THAT WAS CERTAINLY TO THE GOOD
4axc021b BUT NO ONE WAS EVER SURE JUST HOW THE FED WOULD WAGE ITS INFLATION BATTLES
4axc021c MR. MARTIN INDICATED THAT HE WOULD LEAN AGAINST THE WIND WHEN HE SENSED INFLATION COMING AND HE DID
4axc021d HE GOT RID OF THE INFLATION SURGE THAT BEGAN IN NINETEEN FIFTY SIX BUT IT TOOK THE DEEP NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN FIFTY EIGHT RECESSION TO DO SO
4axc021e WITH THE U. S. GOVERNMENT AS ITS PRIME CUSTOMER TRACOR WAS HELPLESS WHEN DEFENSE SPENDING SLOWED
4axc021f INTERNALLY MR. INMAN SAYS HE DISCOVERED THAT EXPENSES COULDN'T BE CUT AS EASILY AS HAD BANKERS HAD FORECAST
4axc021g AND FEES WERE HIGHER THAN EXPECTED
4axc021h MR. INMAN CALLS IT ALL PART OF MY EDUCATION
4axc0301 AT THIS POINT COMPETING DEVELOPERS WERE EYEING THE PROJECT
4axc0302 UNDER ITS GROUND LEASE WITH THE CITY AND STATE THE PARTNERSHIP MIGHT BE FOUND IN DEFAULT ON ITS CONTRACT ENABLING A COMPETING DEVELOPER TO TAKE OVER
4axc0303 TO STAVE OFF AN ATTACK MR. HARRISON SAYS OUR POSITION WAS THAT WE WERE NEVER IN DEFAULT ON OUR LEASE
4axc0304 WE MAINTAIN THAT THE BANK STOPPED FUNDING
4axc0305 STAN WEINSTEIN THE EDITOR OF THE PROFESSIONAL TAPE READER WHICH ALSO RANKED NEAR THE BOTTOM IN THE SURVEY DISAGREES WITH SEVERAL ASSUMPTIONS IN MR. HULBERT'S RANKING METHOD
4axc0306 FOR EXAMPLE MR. WEINSTEIN DISLIKES THE WAY MR. HULBERT CALCULATES ENTRY AND EXIT PRICES
4axc0307 HE SAYS MR. HULBERT SHOULD USE PRICES MIDWAY IN MR. WEINSTEIN'S RECOMMENDED RANGES FOR STOCK PURCHASES OR SALES
4axc0308 MR. HULBERT CUSTOMARILY USES MARKET PRICES EITHER THE OPENING PRICE OR THE AVERAGE PRICE FOR THE DAY SHORTLY AFTER THE RECOMMENDATION WAS MADE
4axc0309 BY CONTRAST THE INDUSTRIAL COMMUNIST NATIONS HAVE FERTILITY MODESTLY ABOVE REPLACEMENT
4axc030a THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES HAVE A T. F. R. OF FOUR POINT ONE
4axc030b THE U. S. HAD A T. F. R. OF THREE POINT EIGHT IN NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN AT THE PEAK OF THE BABY BOOM
4axc030c IN ADDITION TO THE STOCK MARKET FACTORS HURTING THE OFFERING THE DECLINING PRICE OF OIL TOOK ITS TOLL
4axc030d AS THE OFFERING WAS IN ITS PLANNING STAGES IN LATE JULY SPOT CRUDE PRICES APPROACHED TWENTY THREE DOLLARS A BARREL
4axc030e BUT THEY HAD FALLEN TO ABOUT TWENTY DOLLARS WHEN THE PRELIMINARY PROSPECTUS WAS PUBLISHED IN EARLY AUGUST AND HAVE MOSTLY HOVERED BETWEEN NINETEEN AND TWENTY DOLLARS SINCE THEN
4axc030f SPOT PRICES HAVE BEEN SHAKY AT BEST SAID TERRY H. SMITH AN ANALYST AT HOWARD WEIL LABOUISSE FRIEDRICHS INCORPORATED IN NEW ORLEANS
4axc030g A FRENCH PRESS REPORT SAID THE EXPORTS INCLUDE SOPHISTICATED EQUIPMENT FOR MAKING SEMICONDUCTORS
4axc030h IT SAID THE MACHINERY MAY HAVE HELPED THE SOVIETS BUILD ADVANCED COMPUTER MEMORIES FOR SUCH MILITARY PURPOSES AS MISSILE GUIDANCE
4axc030i WESTERN NATIONS HAVE REACHED AGREEMENTS INTENDED TO FORBID EXPORTS OF SUCH EQUIPMENT TO THE SOVIETS
4axc030j A FACTORY WORKER LOUNGES IN A STEAMING HOT TUB INSTALLED IN THE BACK OF A CAR
4axc030k ANOTHER MAN DISPLAYS MUSICAL BATH SLIPPERS
4axc030l A CROWD GATHERS AROUND AN AUTOMOTIVE ENGINEER WHO IS MAKING A FIG TREE DANCE TO THE MUSIC OF KAREN CARPENTER
4axc030m ONE STICKING POINT WAS THE MILITARY SPENDING FIGURE
4axc030n A HESITANCY EXPRESSED BY DEFENSE SECRETARY DESIGNATE FRANK CARLUCCI ABOUT THAT FIGURE PROVED TO BE A STUMBLING BLOCK PARTICIPANTS SAID
4axc030o ONCE YOU PULL OUT ONE OF THE MAJOR BUILDING BLOCKS REPRESENTATIVE WILLIAMS SAID THE WHOLE HOUSE COMES DOWN
4axc030p THE ANNOUNCEMENT WOULD CAP A HIGHLY PUBLICIZED SEARCH FOR A POSSIBLE NEW HOME
4axc030q IT ALSO WOULD REPRESENT A MAJOR VICTORY FOR NEW YORK CITY WHICH HAS BEEN FIGHTING TO KEEP COMPANIES FROM FLEEING THE CITY
4axc030r N. B. C. HAD BEEN CONSIDERING MOVING SOME OR ALL OF ITS FACILITIES TO NEW JERSEY
4axc030s EVENTUALLY THOUGH SHE BURNED OUT ON BODY BUILDING
4axc030t IT WAS OBSESSIVE IT WAS UNHEALTHY SHE RECALLS
4axc030u I LEARNED THAT IT'S NOT NECESSARY TO BE SO COMPULSIVE
4axc030v YOU CAN DO IT IN SMALL SESSIONS
4axc030w <NOISE> NOW I ONLY GO INTO THE GYM TWICE A WEEK AND IT'S LIKE RECESS THE FAVORITE PART OF MY DAY NOT AN INTRUSION ON MY LIFE
4axc030x ANOTHER LESSON SHE CAME AWAY WITH IS THAT THE AMOUNT OF WEIGHT IS IRRELEVANT IN TERMS OF EXERCISING
4axc030y GOOD TECHNIQUE HOLDING THE CONTRACTION THAT'S THE PUREST DEFINITION OF EXERCISE HOW MANY MUSCLE FIBERS CAN YOU EXPLODE
4axc030z ADMINISTRATORS BLAME THE HIGH COST OF CARE ON SUCH FACTORS AS RISING SALARIES WHICH THEY SAY ACCOUNT FOR AS MUCH AS SIXTY PERCENT OF EXPENSES
4axc0310 THEY SAY A NATIONWIDE NURSING SHORTAGE FORCES THEM TO PAY BONUSES FOR QUALIFIED HELP
4axc0311 BUT EVEN AT THIS PRICE THERE ARE SHORTCOMINGS
4axc0312 PORTUGAL'S PRIME MINISTER SAID HIS NATION WANTS TO REVIEW A NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE DEFENSE PACT BUT ISN'T SEEKING A CUT IN U. S. MILITARY FORCES IN THE COUNTRY
4axc0313 CAVACO SILVA WHO MET AT THE WHITE HOUSE WITH REAGAN URGED INCREASED AID
4axc0314 BUT REAGAN SAID ALL NATIONS HOSTING AMERICAN MILITARY BASES MUST SHARE THE PAIN FROM U. S. BUDGET CUTS
4axc0315 IN MY ORIGINAL SQUAD I'M THE ONLY ONE LEFT UNHARMED
4axc0316 IN MY PLATOON THERE'S ONLY THIRTEEN OF US
4axc0317 IT SEEMS EVERYDAY ANOTHER YOUNG GUY EIGHTEEN TO NINETEEN YEARS OLD LIKE MYSELF IS KILLED IN ACTION
4axc0318 TALKS OF BIG BUSINESS INVENTORY TURNS MIGHT HAVE SOUNDED STRANGE IN HIS PARENTS' HOME
4axc0319 MR. KAVNER WAS BORN IN FRANKLIN SQUARE NEW YORK A LONG ISLAND SUBURB OF NEW YORK CITY
4axc031a HIS LATE FATHER WAS A FACTORY WORKER MAKING CHEAP METAL PLATED TROPHIES HIS MOTHER WAS A HOUSEWIFE
4axc031b THE MICRO CHANNEL IS OUR STRATEGY SAID BILL LOWE THE HEAD OF I. B. M.'S P. C. DIVISION
4axc031c WE'VE BEEN CONSISTENTLY SAYING THAT SINCE APRIL NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN WHEN THE P. S. TWO LINE WAS INTRODUCED
4axc031d IF WE KEPT CHANGING DIRECTIONS I COULD SEE PEOPLE QUESTIONING THAT
4axc0401 MACHO NONSENSE OF THIS TYPE ABOUT WORLD TRADE IN THE NATION'S HIGHEST DELIBERATIVE BODY HELPS EXPLAIN WHY CONFIDENCE IN THE U. S. DOLLAR HAS NOT BEEN ROCK SOLID OF LATE
4axc0402 A WHITE HOUSE GAME OF CHICKEN WITH GERMANY AND JAPAN PLAYED BY TALKING DOWN THE DOLLAR HASN'T HELPED EITHER
4axc0403 IT'S TIME TO GET A FEW THINGS STRAIGHT
4axc0404 STOCK EXCHANGES COMMODITY MARKETS MANY BANKS AND SOME BUSINESSES WILL BE CLOSED IN THE U. S. MONDAY IN OBSERVANCE OF WASHINGTON'S BIRTHDAY
4axc0405 FEDERAL OFFICES WILL BE CLOSED AND THERE WON'T BE ANY REGULAR MAIL DELIVERIES
4axc0406 MANY STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICES ALSO WILL BE CLOSED
4axc0407 SODA ASH IS YET ANOTHER TEST
4axc0408 THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION IS PUTTING CONSIDERABLE CLOUT BEHIND INCREASING EXPORTS OF THIS UNSUNG MINERAL USED FOR MAKING GLASS AND OTHER INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS
4axc0409 NO JAPANESE TRADE BARRIERS EXIST JAPANESE MANUFACTURERS CONCERNED WITH PROTECTING DOMESTIC PRODUCERS OF THE CHEMICAL SIMPLY DON'T WANT TO BUY MORE FROM THE U. S.
4axc040a AND M. I. T. I. OFFICIALS AREN'T SURE THEY WANT TO KILL OFF EC- DOMESTIC EX- SUPPLIERS TO MAKE U. S. PRODUCERS HAPPY
4axc040b THE S. E. C. SANCTIONS AGAINST THE FIRM AND MR. BLINDER WERE HANDED DOWN IN DECEMBER
4axc040c THE RULINGS STEM FROM A NINETEEN EIGHTY UNDERWRITING BY MR. BLINDER AND HIS FIRM OF AMERICAN LEISURE CORPORATION A CASINO COMPANY IN NEW YORK
4axc040d THE S. E. C. ACCUSED THE BROKERAGE OF FRAUD IN THE DEAL
4axc040e U. S. LAWMAKERS WHO ARE SYMPATHETIC TO ISRAEL ARE EXPECTED TO REACT TO THE REPORT BY PUBLICLY PRAISING ISRAEL FOR ITS RECENT STEPS
4axc040f <NOISE> HOWEVER THESE LEGISLATORS ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE DETAILS THAT MIGHT BE INCLUDED IN THE REPORT
4axc040g ALSO SINCE MILITARY CONTRACTS BETWEEN JERUSALEM AND PRETORIA ARE SECRET AND IT ISN'T KNOWN WHETHER THE PACTS CONTAIN RENEWAL CLAUSES IT WILL BE DIFFICULT TO MONITOR ISRAELI COMPLIANCE
4axc040h IF NOT MONEY WHAT THEN

4azc020m BUT HE ADDED THAT THE NUMBER THREE U. S. AUTO MAKER MADE A CONSCIOUS DECISION TO SACRIFICE PROFIT FOR A HIGHER MARKET SHARE
4azc020n THAT MOVE IS BEHIND CHRYSLER'S RECENT DECISIONS TO INCREASE PRODUCTION WHICH IN TURN WILL BOOST PROFIT FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR
4azc020o THE CUOMO PLAN DOESN'T STOP AT GOUGING NEW YORK TAXPAYERS AND LONG ISLAND RATEPAYERS
4azc020p FEDERAL TAXPAYERS ALSO WILL CONTRIBUTE
4azc020q THE KEY TO THE DEAL IS THAT LILCO ALSO WOULD GET A TWO POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLAR TAX WRITE OFF FOR SHOREHAM
4azc020r THIS WOULD GUARANTEE THAT THE UTILITY WON'T HAVE TO PAY ANY FEDERAL TAXES FOR AT LEAST A DECADE
4azc020s NEW YORK ALSO WOULD HELP LILCO FLOAT ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN TAX EXEMPT INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT BONDS TO HELP PAY FOR THE CLEANUP

4azc0212 I KNOW BUT IT'S CLOSE
4azc0213 ANOTHER IMPORTANT THING IS THIS
4azc0214 BEING A LIBERAL IS NOT LIKE BEING A DEMOCRAT
4azc0215 BEING A DEMOCRAT OR A REPUBLICAN IS LIKE HAVING THE RED PIECES OR THE BLACK PIECES IN A CHECKERS GAME
4azc0216 IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY MORAL IMPLICATIONS
4azc0217 BUT BEING A LIBERAL IS BA:D

4azc0303 THE FIRST DIVIDEND IS PAYABLE IN JULY TO STOCK OF RECORD JULY FIFTH
4azc0304 COMPUTRAC WILL PAY NINE CENTS IN JANUARY NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT TO STOCK OF RECORD JANUARY FIFTH NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT
4azc0305 THAT MAY BE BUT THERE ARE TOUGH CALLS
4azc0306 EMOTIONAL UPSET HEADACHES BACKACHES AND OTHER SUBJECTIVE *SYMPTOMS* ARE HARD TO QUANTIFY
4azc0307 BESIDES SOMEONE WHO TRULY FEELS DISABLED MAY AS A RESULT ACTUALLY BE DISABLED
4azc0308 A WELL TIMED PERIOD OF TIME OFF WITH STRESS REDUCTION AND AN EFFORT AT BETTER UNDERSTANDING MAY PREVENT A MUCH WORSE DISABILITY LATER
4azc0309 IT MAY ALSO UNCOVER FACTORS AT THE WORKPLACE THAT CAN BE IMPROVED
4azc030a I TRY TO GIVE THE PATIENT THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT WITHIN REASON

4azc030i EVEN MORE EIGHTY TWO PERCENT REGARD U. S. REACTORS AS SAFER THAN THE CHERNOBYL PLANT

4azc030t YOU HAVE TO LEARN TO TOLERATE FOOLS
4azc030u THE RIGHT WING UNDERWORLD ISN'T ALWAYS ON THE SIDE OF THE LANDOWNER AS THE ATTACKS ON THE SUMITOMO COMPANIES SUGGEST
4azc030v A YEAR AGO SUMITOMO REALTY RECEIVED A BOMB THREAT AT ITS TOKYO HEADQUARTERS AND MR. ANDO THE CHAIRMAN FOUND A CARDBOARD BOX BURNING ON HIS DOORSTEP
4azc030w THIS OCCURRED WHEN ALLEGATIONS SURFACED LINKING FORMER SUMITOMO EXECUTIVES WITH A LOAN SCANDAL INVOLVING A LAND SHARK COMPANY
4azc030x MR. LI'S CAUTION MAY BE PARTICULARLY APPROPRIATE FOR CHINA AT PRESENT DIPLOMATS IN BEIJING SAID
4azc030y AFTER SEVERAL YEARS OF SPECTACULAR GROWTH CHINA'S ECONOMY IS STRUGGLING
4azc030z PRICES ARE SKYROCKETING CORRUPTION IS RAMPANT AND GRAIN PRODUCTION IS STAGNANT
4azc0310 EVEN THE MOST LIBERAL REFORMERS BELIEVE CHINA'S ECONOMIC PLANNERS SHOULD MOVE IN THE COMING YEAR TO SOLVE SUCH PROBLEMS BEFORE FURTHER REFORMS CAN BE INTRODUCED
4azc0311 SOME CRITICS SEE THE GROWTH CONTROL MOVEMENT AS THE INDULGENCE OF A SELF SATISFIED MIDDLE CLASS

4azc0317 MR. FORBES SAID HE'D HAD NO COMMUNICATION WITH ANYONE FROM THE I. R. S. TRYING TO DISSUADE HIM FROM PUBLISHING SUCH A STORY
4azc0318 I ASSURE YOU THAT FORBES DOESN'T KILL STORIES AT THE REQUEST OF THE I. R. S. OR ANYONE ELSE HE SAID
4azc0319 INDEED HE ADDED SUCH A CALL WOULD ALMOST ENSURE THE APPEARANCE OF SUCH A STORY
4azc031a MR. FORBES ALSO SAID HE WOULD BE HARD PUT TO THINK OF THE COMMISSIONER'S NAME <NOISE>
4azc031b <NOISE> I JUST WANTED TO TAKE A MINUTE TO THANK YOU FOR RUNNING ALEXANDER COCKBURN'S VIEWPOINT COLUMN
4azc031c HIS COLUMNS OFTEN PROVIDE A FRESH SLANT ON THE MAJOR ISSUES OF THE DAY
4azc031d <NOISE> HIS IDEAS ARE OFTEN CONTRARY TO POPULAR OPINION BUT THEY PROVIDE NEW IDEAS TO BROADEN THE READER'S OWN PERSPECTIVE

4azc0405 FOR NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX WESTINGHOUSE HAD SALES OF TEN POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS
4azc0406 WESTINGHOUSE HAS NO OTHER CONTRACTS WITH AGENCIES IN SOUTH AFRICA
4azc0407 THE LEFT SAYS IT WILL STOP ITS DESTRUCTION WHEN PRESIDENT DUARTE BRINGS THE REBELS INTO THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMY IN AN OFFICIAL POWER SHARING ARRANGEMENT
4azc0408 THAT WON'T HAPPEN SOON IF EVER
4azc0409 BUT IN CONTESTED ZONES THE GUERRILLAS ARE ALREADY INVOLVED IN A DE FACTO POWER SHARING REL:ATIONSHIP WITH SAN SALVADOR
4azc040a <NOISE> THE RULING MEANS RAILROAD UNIONS MAY CONTINUE FOR NOW TO USE THE POTENT WEAPON OF SECONDARY PICKETING
4azc040b BUT THE RULING ALSO WILL INCREASE PRESSURE ON CONGRESS FROM THE RAILROAD INDUSTRY AND POSSIBLY THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION TO PASS LEGISLATION PROHIBITING SECONDARY PICKETING OF RAILROADS
4azc040c CONGRESS TOOK NO ACTION ON A SIMILAR PROPOSAL LAST YEAR
4azc040d BUT EVEN INVESTORS WHO DO ALL THE HOMEWORK AND REQUEST ALL THE DOCUMENTS SHOULDN'T FEEL TOO COMPLACENT
4azc040e <NOISE> THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MUST BE UPDATED EVERY YEAR SO NEW PROSPECTUSES ARE ISSUED ANNUALLY

4azc040k HE ASKED FOR THIRTY MILLION DOLLAR LOAN EVEN THOUGH HENDERSON IS ONE OF WALL STREET'S BEST CAPITALIZED SPECIALIST FIRMS

4azc040m THEY STATED THEY WERE IN NO POSITION TO MAKE COMMITMENTS MR. MAGUIRE SAYS
4azc040n CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN INHERITED FROM HIS PREDECESSOR PAUL VOLCKER A MONETARY POLICY THAT HAD BEEN QUITE ERRATIC
4azc040o <NOISE> THE FED ALLOWED THE MONEY SUPPLY TO GROW VERY RAPIDLY THROUGH NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
4azc040p THEN IN EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN THE CENTRAL BANK TIGHTENED UP SHARPLY
4azc040q FOR THE FIRST FEW MONTHS OF THIS YEAR I THOUGHT POLICY MIGHT BE ALL RIGHT SAYS MILTON FRIEDMAN OF THE HOOVER INSTITUTION
4azc040r <NOISE> YOU COULD SAY THAT IT WAS OFFSETTING THE EXCESSIVELY EASY POLICY OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
4azc040s BUT THE RESTRAINT CONTINUED AND IN EARLY OCTOBER BEFORE THE MARKET CRASH MR. FRIEDMAN PREDICTED A RECESSION WOULD START IN SIX TO NINE MONTHS
4azc040t WEST GERMANY IS PLAYING FOR THE LONG TERM SAYS PIERRE LELLOUCHE OF THE FRENCH INSTITUTE FOR FOREIGN RELATIONS
4azc040u IT BELIEVES IT CAN GET EAST GERMANY BACK WITHOUT FALLING UNDER SOVIET DOMINATION ITSELF
4azc040v MR. LELLOUCHE AND MOST OTHER FRENCHMEN DON'T THINK THIS IS POSSIBLE
4azc040w THE TEAM SAYS THIS KIND OF ACTION PROTECTS ITS VALUABLE PLAYERS FROM ABUSE
4azc040x JOEY KNOWS HIS ROLE SAYS COACH DEMERS
4azc040y HE CITES THE TIME A SAINT LOUIS PLAYER SWUNG HIS STICK AT A RED WING NOT KNOWN FOR HIS FIGHTING SKILLS
4azc040z I TOLD JOEY TO GO OUT THERE AND TELL HIM NOT TO DO IT AGAIN SAYS THE COACH
4azc0410 THE MESSAGE GOT THROUGH IF NOT NECESSARILY IN WORDS
4azc0411 SUBSEQUENT GOVERNMENT REPORTS HOWEVER SHOW THAT EMPLOYMENT GROWTH WAS RELATIVELY STRONG IN THE FIRST QUARTER
4azc0412 MOREOVER THE FOURTH QUARTER BUILD UP IN BUSINESS INVENTORIES HAS BEEN REVISED DOWN SOMEWHAT BY THE COMMERCE DEPARTMENT
4azc0413 AS A RESULT THE CENTRAL BANK APPARENTLY IS REVERSING ITS JANUARY MOVE
4azc0414 GIVEN THE NATURE OF OUR OWNERSHIP IT'S OBVIOUSLY A VERY COMPLEX ISSUE MR. ELISH SAID
4azc0415 THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS TO CONSIDER AND WE'RE LOOKING AT IT
4azc0416 BUT NOTHING IS IMMINENT
4azc0417 <NOISE> NOW HE SAID THINGS HAVE BEEN TURNED AROUND
4azc0418 WE HEAR TALK HE SAID THAT IT'S TIME FOR A CHANGE

4b0c0201 WHEN HU *YAOBANG* WAS DUMPED IN JANUARY AS THE COMMUNIST PARTY'S SECRETARY GENERAL MR. ZHAO WAS ELEVATED TO THAT POST ON AN ACTING BASIS
4b0c0202 THAT MADE MR. ZHAO A PROTEGE OF DENG XIAOPING THE DE FACTO HEAD OF THE PARTY AS WELL AS THE GOVERNMENT
4b0c0203 IT IS A DELICATE POSITION REQUIRING HIM TO MANEUVER AMONG VARIOUS INTEREST GROUPS AND PERSONAL CLIQUES THAT MAKE UP CHINA'S TOP LEADERSHIP
4b0c0204 IN THE CAREFREE DAYS BEFORE DEREGULATION IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT FIVE BIG AIRLINES HANDLED MOST OF THE PASSENGER TRAFFIC IN AND OUT OF LAMBERT SAINT

4b0c0209 WEDNESDAY'S DECLINE TRIGGERED BUY ORDERS AND SOME TRADERS BOUGHT DOLLARS TO COVER SHORT OR OVERSOLD POSITIONS

4b0c020d SOUTHLAND EXPECTS PROCEEDS FROM ASSET SALES TO TOTAL EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS BY THE END OF NEXT YEAR

4b0c020i IT FORECASTS A THREE POINT FIVE PERCENT GROWTH FOR NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE AND NINETEEN NINETY AND STEADILY FALLING INTEREST RATES AND INFLATION RATES
4b0c020j BUT FORECASTERS INSIDE GOVERNMENT AND OUT HAVE A POOR RECORD IN PREDICTING ECONOMIC TRENDS THAT FAR IN THE FUTURE
4b0c020k FOR A SHIP OR MISSILE GUIDED BY THE WRONG TIME SIGNAL THAT LITTLE GAP COULD MEAN ARRIVING AT THE WRONG DESTINATION
4b0c020l IF WE LET THE DIFFERENCE GROW SAYS MR. MCCARTHY WE COULD RUN INTO PROBLEMS OVER THOUSANDS OF YEARS
4b0c020m IT MIGHT BE NOON BY ATOMIC TIME BUT DARK OUTSIDE
4b0c020n MOREOVER SOME HOUSING SPECIALISTS SAY PERMIT ACTIVITY IS A POOR INDICATOR OF FUTURE STARTS ARGUING THAT IT REFLECTS CURRENT HOUSING ACTIVITY RATHER THAN PREDICTING FUTURE ACTIVITY
4b0c020o THEY PREDICT THAT INSTEAD OF FALLING HOUSING STARTS WILL IMPROVE IN COMING MONTHS IN REACTION TO INCREASING NEW <NOISE> AND EXISTING HOME SALES
4b0c020p ONE NOTABLE EXCEPTION TO THIS TREND WILL BE THE SOUTHWEST WHICH HAS BEEN BATTERED BY RECESSION AND A HOUSING GLUT

4b1c0419 TO THE EXTENT THE EXPORT GROWTH CONTINUES IT WILL KEEP THE U. S. ECONOMY FROM SLIPPING ADDED MR. WITTEN

4b2c030g THE COMPLEX PLAN GRADUALLY GIVES THE COMPANY TO THE DEBT HOLDERS SAID CHARLES E. BAYLESS FINANCIAL VICE PRESIDENT
4b2c030h IN CONTRAST IF THE UTILITY BEGAN BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS THEY THE DEBT HOLDERS WOULD GET IT RIGHT NOW HE SAID
4b2c030i IN EITHER CASE THE INTERESTS OF THE UTILITY'S COMMON SHAREHOLDERS WOULD BE SUBSTANTIALLY DILUTED HE SAID
4b2c030j <NOISE> ANOTHER REASON MR. SOIFER IS AVOIDING MORGAN AND CITICORP IS THAT THEIR STOCK PRICES AT TIMES HAVE TENDED TO GYRATE MORE VIOLENTLY THAN OTHER BANK ISSUES
4b2c030k CITICORP AND MORGAN TEND TO HAVE MORE VOLATILITY ON DAYS WHEN PROGRAM TRADING IS KNOWN TO OCCUR MR. SOIFER SAYS
4b2c030l THEY'RE MORE OF A BET ON WHICH WAY THE MARKET IS HEADED
4b2c030m MR. REICHLER RECENTLY STUNNED SOME LIBERALS WHEN HE AGREED TO REPRESENT THE GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT IN ITS QUEST TO WIN U. S. AID FOR ITS POLICE FORCE AND MILITARY
4b2c030n SOME HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS STRONGLY OPPOSED THE REQUEST CITING GUATEMALAN AUTHORITIES' HISTORY OF ABUSES
4b2c030o <NOISE> MR. REICHLER LAUNCHED A LOBBYING BLITZ AMONG U. S. LIBERALS ARGUING THAT THE AID WOULD HELP STEM VIOLATIONS
4b2c030p THE POLICE GOT TWO MILLION DOLLARS FOR TRAINING AND GUATEMALA ALSO GOT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN MILITARY ASSISTANCE
4b2c030q ADMINISTRATORS BLAME THE HIGH COST OF CARE ON SUCH FACTORS AS RISING SALARIES WHICH THEY SAY ACCOUNT FOR AS MUCH AS SIXTY PERCENT OF EXPENSES
4b2c030r THEY SAY A NATIONWIDE NURSING SHORTAGE FORCES THEM TO PAY BONUSES FOR QUALIFIED HELP
4b2c030s BUT EVEN AT THIS PRICE THERE ARE SHORTCOMINGS
4b2c030t SCIENTIFIC STUDIES HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THE DEVICE CAUSED INFECTIONS THAT LED TO SEVERE COMPLICATIONS
4b2c030u <NOISE> ROBINS STILL CONTENDS OTHER FACTORS INCLUDING SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASE CONTRIBUTED TO THE INJURIES
4b2c030v THE COMPANY ALSO INSISTS THE SHIELD ISN'T ANY MORE DANGEROUS THAN OTHER I. U. D.S
4b2c030w NE WIN'S SINGLE PARTY POLITICAL SYSTEM LONG HAS BEEN UNPOPULAR BUT IT HAS REMAINED IN POWER LARGELY BECAUSE OF MILITARY SUPPORT
4b2c030x IN HIS TWENTY SIX YEAR RULE NE WIN TRANSFORMED BURMA FROM ONE OF SOUTHEAST ASIA'S RICHEST SOCIETIES TO ONE OF THE WORLD'S POOREST COUNTRIES
4b2c030y UNDER HIS BURMESE WAY TO SOCIALISM THE STATE TOOK CONTROL OF ALMOST ALL ASPECTS OF ECONOMIC POLITICAL AND SOCIAL LIFE
4b2c030z THE PUBLIC FILINGS SHOW THAT A FIRM CALLED CAMRO ASSOCIATES ACQUIRED A ONE PERCENT NONVOTING STAKE IN SEEMALA IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR
4b2c0310 SEEMALA DISCLOSED THE CAMRO STAKE IN A PUBLIC S. E. C. FILING THAT YEAR SEEMALA DIDN'T IDENTIFY THE INVESTORS IN CAMRO
4b2c0311 BUT A SEPARATE NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR FILING BY CAMRO IN CALIFORNIA IDENTIFIES CAMRO AS A GENERAL PARTNERSHIP MADE UP OF MR. MILKEN AND TWENTY SIX OTHER DREXEL EMPLOYEES
4b2c0312 IN THE CURRENT DEBATE MR. BUSH IS USING THE A. C. L. U. TO PIN A LIBERAL LABEL ON HIS DEMOCRATIC CHALLENGER
4b2c0313 BUT THE A. C. L. U. HAS RELIED THROUGHOUT MUCH OF ITS HISTORY ON REPUBLICAN SUPPORT AND HAS ALLIED ITSELF WITH REPUBLICANS ON NUMEROUS ISSUES
4b2c0314 IN THE CURRENT CONTROVERSY SOME REPUBLICANS ARE TRYING TO MINIMIZE THEIR PAST INVOLVEMENT
4b2c0315 TO BE SURE THE DEFICIT HAS DECLINED IN THE PAST FEW YEARS
4b2c0316 BUT THAT DECLINE IS ENTIRELY THE RESULT OF THE RISING SURPLUS IN THE SOCIAL SECURITY TRUST FUND
4b2c0317 THAT MONEY SHOULD BE INVESTED TO HELP DEFRAY THE FUTURE RETIREMENT COSTS OF THE BABY BOOMERS INSTEAD IT IS BEING USED TO PAPER OVER THE DEFICIT
4b2c0318 <NOISE> THAT'S YET ANOTHER SYMPTOM OF MR. DARMAN'S NATIONAL NOW NOW ISM
4b2c0319 OUR PROBLEM IS GETTING THIS VERY VERY ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY TO ACTUALLY WORK SAYS ANTHONY SIMONDS GOODING BRITISH SATELLITE'S CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
4b2c031a OUR CREDIBILITY IS CLOSE TO ZERO UNTIL THEN
4b2c031b SOME ANALYSTS TAKE A HARSHER VIEW
4b2c031c THERE IS A SERIOUS QUESTION MARK OVER B. S. B. MANAGEMENT SAYS MARK ASTAIRE A MEDIA ANALYST AT U. K. BROKERS HOARE GOVETT LIMITED
4b2c031d SO FAR EVERYTHING HAS GONE WRONG
4b2c0401 THAT HARDLY MATTERS SAYS SIR GEOFFREY NOTING THAT WITH ALL THE TRAITOR SPIES THAT PRECEDED HIM THERE WASN'T MUCH LEFT TO TELL
4b2c0402 THE POINT IS HE WAS ONE OF US
4b2c0403 HE JOINED M. I. FIVE STRAIGHT OUT OF OXFORD
4b2c0404 BEEN IN THE CIVIL SERVICE ALL HIS LIFE
4b2c0405 THE SALE ALSO PROVIDES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WITH CASH AS IT TRIES TO NARROW THE BUDGET DEFICIT
4b2c0406 AFTER SUBTRACTING UNDERWRITERS' FEES OF ABOUT SEVENTY MILLION THE GOVERNMENT'S NET PROCEEDS FROM THE OFFERING ARE ONE POINT FIVE EIGHT BILLION
4b2c0407 IN ADDITION THE GOVERNMENT HAS ALREADY BEEN PAID THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FROM CONRAIL'S CASH RESERVES UNDER PROVISIONS OF THE PUBLIC OFFERING
4b2c0408 A SOURCE CLOSE TO TEXACO SAID THAT WHILE TEXACO IS ANXIOUS TO EMERGE FROM CHAPTER ELEVEN IT ISN'T IN THE COMPANY'S OR SHAREHOLDERS' INTEREST TO RUSH INTO A SETTLEMENT
4b2c0409 IT'S NORMAL FOR CREDITORS TO WANT A QUICK SETTLEMENT
4b2c040a BUT TEXACO'S SHAREHOLDERS HAVE A BIG SAY IN THIS CASE AND THEY AREN'T PUSHING FOR A SETTLEMENT FOR SETTLEMENT'S SAKE THE SOURCE SAID
4b2c040b BUT ON TUESDAY KIDDER PEABODY'S JACK KIRNAN DROPPED CHRYSLER TO A HOLD RATING
4b2c040c VANS AND TRUCKS ARE SELLING WELL HE CONCEDES BUT CHRYSLER'S CAR SALES HAVE BEEN VERY DISAPPOINTING
4b2c040d HE ALSO FIGURES CHRYSLER WILL TAKE LONGER THAN EXPECTED TO STRAIGHTEN OUT AMERICAN MOTORS WHICH IT ACQUIRED WEDNESDAY
4b2c040e BUT EVEN INVESTORS WHO DO ALL THE HOMEWORK AND REQUEST ALL THE DOCUMENTS SHOULDN'T FEEL TOO COMPLACENT
4b2c040f THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MUST BE UPDATED EVERY YEAR SO NEW PROSPECTUSES ARE ISSUED ANNUALLY
4b2c040g SOMETIMES ONLY THE PER SHARE DATA TABLE CHANGES BUT OFTEN OTHER REVISIONS ARE INCLUDED
4b2c040h THE MINISTERS NEXT WILL GO TO KUWAIT THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES AND IRAQ ALL SAID TO BE PRODUCING BEYOND THEIR QUOTAS
4b2c040i FINAL STOPS ON THIS LEG OF THE TOUR WILL BE QATAR AND IRAN
4b2c040j A SECOND TRIP TO OTHER OPEC COUNTRIES IS SET FOR NOVEMBER
4b2c040k THE WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY FOR THE CREATION OF SUPERREGIONAL BANKS MIGHT NOT BE OPEN LONG
4b2c040l THEN WE WILL FACE THE CHALLENGE OF CONSOLIDATING OUR POSITIONS
4b2c040m IT'S GOING TO BE TOUGH
4b2c040n WHAT HAS DISTINGUISHED US IS THAT OUR RETURNS ON ASSETS AND EQUITY ARE FAR ABOVE AVERAGE
4b2c040o MAINTAINING THOSE LEVELS THAT'S GOING TO BE THE CHALLENGE
4b2c040p YET HE STRIVES TO REASSURE CANADA'S MIDDLE CLASS CALLING HIMSELF A SCANDINAVIAN STYLE SOCIAL DEMOCRAT WHO APPRECIATES THE BENEFITS OF CAPITALISM
4b2c040q THERE'S NO MINDLESS ATTEMPT TO SAY WE'RE GOING TO TAX PRIVATE CORPORATIONS OUT OF EXISTENCE HE SAYS
4b2c040r THAT'S SILLY YOU DON'T DO THAT
4b2c040s YOU WANT THEM TO DO WELL
4b2c040t BUT SCALI MCCABE WON'T BE EARNING COMMISSIONS FROM THE PURCHASE OF MEDIA SPOTS FOR KIDS *R.* US
4b2c040u MEDIA PLACEMENT FOR THE UNIT LIKE ITS PARENT IS DONE BY OTHER FIRMS
4b2c040v SCALI MCCABE WILL INSTEAD BE PAID ON A NEGOTIATED FEE BASIS FOR CREATING THE ADS
4b2c040w THE FEES WEREN'T DISCLOSED
4b2c040x BUT CRITICS CHARGED THAT THE COLLAR ACTUALLY ADDED TO VOLATILITY BY MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR INDEX ARBITRAGERS TO DO THEIR BUSINESS
4b2c040y MANY TRADERS ARGUE THAT SUCH ARBITRAGE HAS THE EFFECT OF SMOOTHING OUT VOLATILITY IN THE MARKETS
4b2c040z INDEX ARBITRAGERS BUY AND SELL LARGE AMOUNTS OF STOCKS AND STOCK INDEX FUTURES TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF BRIEF PRICE DISPARITIES BETWEEN THE TWO RELATED INSTRUMENTS
4b2c0410 BANKERS TRUST'S QUARTERLY PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES TOTALED FIVE MILLION DOLLARS COMPARED WITH TWENTY MILLION A YEAR EARLIER
4b2c0411 BUT THE BANK HAD NET RECOVERIES OF THREE POINT ONE MILLION COMPARED WITH NINETEEN MILLION OF NET CHARGE OFFS IN THE YEAR EARLIER QUARTER
4b2c0412 AND THE TOTAL ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES REMAINED UNCHANGED AT ONE POINT THREE BILLION
4b2c0413 JOINT VENTURE PROJECTS THAT ARE STILL UNDER NEGOTIATION ARE TO BE SCRUTINIZED CHINESE OFFICIALS SAY
4b2c0414 THOSE INVOLVING CONSTRUCTION OF HOTELS OR OFFICE BUILDINGS AREN'T LIKELY TO WIN GOVERNMENT APPROVAL
4b2c0415 CHINA IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO APPROVE MOST INVESTMENTS IN EXPORT RELATED INDUSTRIES AND IN PROJECTS COVERING ENERGY TRANSPORT COMMUNICATIONS RAW MATERIALS AND CHEMICALS
4b2c0416 A SHORTAGE OF ENERGY AND RAW MATERIALS IS ALREADY WREAKING HAVOC IN MANY OF CHINA'S MAJOR INDUSTRIES
4b2c0417 A FACTORY THAT MAKES NIKE SHOES IN GUANGDONG PROVINCE HAS TO RUN A GENERATOR THREE DAYS A WEEK TO STAY IN OPERATION
4b2c0418 THE PLANT'S TAIWANESE JOINT VENTURE PARTNERS ARE STOCKPILING COAL AND OIL FOR POWER IN CASE THEIR SUPPLIES GET CUT OFF
4b2c0419 MANY NEARBY CHINESE FACTORIES SIMPLY SHUT DOWN TWO OR THREE DAYS A WEEK FOR WANT OF ENERGY
4b2c041a MOREOVER TWO THOUSAND WORKERS AT THE TIANJIN ALUMINUM PRODUCTS FACTORY RECENTLY WERE ORDERED HOME BECAUSE THE COMPANY COULDN'T GET ENOUGH RAW MATERIALS
4b2c041b AT ONE POINT THIS YEAR SUPPLY SHORTAGES FORCED A THIRD OF THE NATION'S ALUMINUM FACTORIES TO CLOSE
4b2c041c MEANWHILE CIVIL RICO CONTINUES TO ATTRACT PLAINTIFFS WHO WANT TO TURN GENERAL BUSINESS DISPUTES THAT BELONG IN STATE COURTS INTO FEDERAL OFFENSES
4b2c041d FOR EXAMPLE A SMALL CONSORTIUM OF CONTRACTORS WHO CONSULTED ME HAD SUBMITTED THE LOW BID FOR A LARGE MARINA TO BE CONSTRUCTED ON LAKE MICHIGAN
4b2c041e THE SECOND LOWEST BIDDER RECENTLY FILED A CIVIL RICO ACTION CLAIMING THAT MISREPRESENTATIONS WERE MADE BY THE SUCCESSFUL BIDDERS USING THE TELEPHONE THEREBY COMMITTING FEDERAL WIRE FRAUD
4b2c041f NO MATTER WHAT THE DETERMINATION OF THE SUIT THE LOW BIDDERS ALREADY HAVE FELT THE STING OF SUCH POISONOUS WORDS AS RACKETEER
4b3c0201 SUCH RESULTS ARE CAUSING SOME WALL STREET PROFESSIONALS TO TAKE THE JANUARY INDICATOR LESS SERIOUSLY THAN THEY USED TO
4b3c0202 I'M PUTTING LESS EMPHASIS ON SOME OF THESE TRADITIONAL BAROMETERS SAYS EUGENE PERONI DIRECTOR OF TECHNICAL RESEARCH FOR JANNEY MONTGOMERY SCOTT INCORPORATED IN PHILADELPHIA
4b3c0203 THEY ARE NOT THE MOST SCIENTIFIC THINGS AROUND
4b3c0204 MR. WALTER WOULD BE RICH IF NOT FOR HIS AWFUL BUSINESS SENSE SAYS HIS BROTHER DANIEL A MARKETING EXECUTIVE
4b3c0205 MY MOTHER SAYS GO HELP YOUR BROTHER
4b3c0206 I SAY THE ONLY WAY I COULD HELP HIM IS WITH A GARBAGE TRUCK TO HAUL AWAY THE OLD COMPUTER MANUALS THAT LITTER HIS APARTMENT
4b3c0207 LIKE THEIR ECONOMIES THE CURRENCIES OF THE U. S. AND CANADA ARE CLOSELY RELATED
4b3c0208 <NOISE> BUT AS INTEREST RATES RISE IN CANADA THE CANADIAN DOLLAR IS GAINING ON ITS U. S. COUNTERPART TRADERS AND ANALYSTS SAY
4b3c0209 AND AS THE CANADIAN UNIT RISES IT LURES MORE FOREIGN INVESTMENT PARTICULARLY FROM JAPAN WHICH ADDS TO ITS STRENGTH <NOISE>
4b3c020a IN VIEDMA MEANWHILE DEPUTY GOVERNOR OSCAR MACHADO EXUDES PROVINCIAL CONFIDENCE
4b3c020b HE HAS PUT UP A SIGN IN THE MAIN SQUARE WELCOMING VISITORS TO THE NEW FEDERAL CAPITAL
4b3c020c HE ACTUALLY BELIEVES HIS CORNER OF PATAGONIA WILL SOON BE ADORNED WITH NEW ROADS TELEPHONES EMBASSIES AND HOTELS
4b3c020d HE SAYS HE EXPECTS PRESIDENT ALFONSIN TO START COMING REGULARLY NEXT YEAR
4b3c020e IN MORE INNOCENT TIMES THE LEGAL PROFESSION WAS AN EXCLUSIVE CLUB THAT LOOKED AFTER ITS OWN
4b3c020f SQUABBLES WERE SETTLED BEHIND THE COURTHOUSE
4b3c020g LAWYERLY MISDEEDS WERE HUSHED UP OR HURRIEDLY RESOLVED
4b3c020h CLIENTS WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT SCANDALOUS TO SUE THE FAMILY OR COMPANY LAWYER
4b3c020i GENERAL RAMOS ALSO CONFIRMED FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT PHILIPPINE AUTHORITIES WERE LOOKING INTO POSSIBLE FOREIGN INVOLVEMENT IN THE COUP ATTEMPT THE ASSOCIATED PRESS REPORTED
4b3c020j GENERAL RAMOS SAID THE MILITARY WAS INVESTIGATING THE PRESENCE OF SOME FOREIGN PERSONNEL NEAR ARMED FORCES HEADQUARTERS DURING THE UPRISING
4b3c020k HE DECLINED TO ELABORATE
4b3c020l THE *BLACKSTONE* FUND BLACKSTONE CAPITAL PARTNERS L. P. IS SEEKING TO RAISE ONE BILLION DOLLARS
4b3c020m IT HAS ALREADY GATHERED SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FUND OFFICIALS SAID
4b3c020n THE FUND'S LIMITED PARTNERS INCLUDE SOME OF THE LARGEST MOST POWERFUL CORPORATIONS IN THE WORLD SAID PETER G. PETERSON BLACKSTONE GROUP'S CHAIRMAN
4b3c020o DISCUSSING THE PROPOSED AGREEMENT NORMAN BAILEY A WASHINGTON BASED CONSULTANT AND FORMER MEMBER OF THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL SAID IT'S RIDICULOUS
4b3c020p IT'S WORSE THAN A JERRY BUILT HOUSE
4b3c020q FROM THE BANKS' STANDPOINT HE CHARACTERIZED THE PROPOSED AGREEMENT AS ALMOST WORSE THAN LENDING THEMSELVES THE MONEY
4b3c020r HE HELPED US TO LOOK AT THE DIFFERENT OPTIONS SAYS ALFRED S. WARREN THE G. M. VICE PRESIDENT LEADING THE NEGOTIATIONS UNDER MR. JOHNSON
4b3c020s HE WAS VERY REFRESHING IN SOME OF HIS THOUGHTS AND IDEAS
4b3c020t BUT THE IDEAS NEVER BECAME REALITY
4b3c020u G. M. EVENTUALLY SIGNED A TRADITIONAL PACT PATTERNED CLOSELY AFTER FORD'S
4b3c020v FINALLY THOUGH THE CONSIDERABLE SUCCESS OF THE COLOR OF BLOOD RESTS IN THE CREATION OF BEM AND HIS STUMBLING JOURNEY OF DISCOVERY
4b3c020w AT LAST HE FINDS A MOMENT OF INNER PEACE AND JOY
4b3c020x YET IT IS A MOMENT QUICKLY ENDED
4b3c020y IN THIS BLEAK WORLD THE FUTURE WOULD SEEM TO BELONG TO THE TYRANTS AND TERRORISTS
4b3c020z FOR OVER HALF A CENTURY FEDERAL POLICY HAS SAPPED THE PRODUCTIVITY OF THE WORLD'S STRONGEST AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY
4b3c0210 THE REAL ISSUE IS NOT THE DOLLAR AMOUNT OF U. S. FOOD EXPORTS BUT WHETHER THOSE EXPORTS ARE SOLD AT A PROFIT OR A LOSS
4b3c0211 THE SOONER POLITICIANS STOP TRYING TO HELP FARMERS THE BETTER OFF THE MOST EFFICIENT PRODUCTIVE FARMERS WILL BE
4b3c0212 ESPRIT IS NOW A LEANER COMPANY THAT OPERATES MORE CONVENTIONALLY
4b3c0213 ACCORDING TO MR. FEDERICO THE OPERATIONS CHIEF EACH DIVISION NOW HAS A BUDGET TO FOLLOW FOR THE FIRST TIME
4b3c0214 THE NEW EXECUTIVES IN ESPRIT'S SENIOR MANAGEMENT INCLUDING VETERANS FROM CALVIN KLEIN AND IZOD LACOSTE HAVE TIGHTENED MARKETING AND QUALITY CONTROLS
4b3c0215 OFFICERS FOR MAJOR DEPARTMENT STORES SAY ESPRIT IS KEEPING CLOSER TRACK OF SALES AND OFFERING CLOTHES MORE IN TUNE WITH TODAY'S TASTES
4b3c0216 THINGS ARE A BIT DULLER THIS YEAR
4b3c0217 MR. BILZERIAN HAS SENT HIS BOY TO A LITTLE LEAGUE TEAM IN FARAWAY MINNESOTA WHERE THE FAMILY SPENDS ITS SUMMERS AND ISN'T COACHING A TEAM THIS YEAR
4b3c0218 ALL THE ACTION APPARENTLY WILL BE IN THE COURTROOM
4b3c0219 UNTIL NOW SANCTIONS BACKERS IN CONGRESS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO USE SOUTH AFRICA FOR THEIR OWN DOMESTIC POLITICAL PURPOSES WITHOUT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE FULL COSTS
4b3c021a THE SUFFERING THAT SANCTIONS HAVE INFLICTED ON BLACKS AND THE LOSS OF U. S. INFLUENCE IN THE REGION HAVE NOT IMPRESSED THEM MUCH
4b3c021b BUT THE NEXT ROUND WILL DO MORE SEVERE DAMAGE ON THEIR OWN CONSTITUENTS
4b3c021c THAT WILL BE SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT AS THE SENATE DEBATES WHETHER TO SECOND THE SCORCHED EARTH POLICY THE HOUSE HAS ADOPTED
4b3c021d BROKERAGE FIRMS WHICH NEGOTIATE RATES WITH THE BANKS AND THRIFTS WHOSE C. D.S THEY SELL OFFER SOME OF THE BEST YIELDS
4b3c021e THE AVERAGE YIELD ON A BROKER SOLD THREE MONTH C. D. FOR EXAMPLE WAS EIGHT POINT SIX SIX PERCENT
4b3c021f THE AVERAGE YIELD ON TWO YEAR C. D.S SOLD BY BROKERS ROSE NEARLY A FIFTH OF A PERCENTAGE POINT TO EIGHT POINT FOUR THREE PERCENT

4b3c030d SENATE LEADERS PLAN TO BEGIN DEBATE ON THE NOMINATION AS EARLY AS TODAY
4b3c030e THERE IS ALSO A SECURITIES LAW ISSUE WHICH HAD LED THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION TO FILE AN AMICUS BRIEF ON BEHALF OF TEXACO'S APPEAL
4b3c030f RULE TEN B. THIRTEEN SAYS ONCE A TENDER OFFER BEGINS THE BIDDER MUST TREAT ALL SHAREHOLDERS ALIKE
4b3c030g BUT PENNZOIL OFFERED TO PAY THE GETTY MUSEUM MORE FOR ITS SHARES SOONER THAN IT WOULD PAY OTHER SHAREHOLDERS EVEN IF THE MERGER FAILED
4b3c030h THE S. E. C. SAID THAT THIS PLAINLY VIOLATED RULE TEN B. THIRTEEN
4b3c030i EVEN IF THERE WAS A CONTRACT IT WAS VOID
4b3c030j TEXACO CAN'T BE GUILTY OF INTERFERING WITH A NONEXISTENT CONTRACT

4b3c030o U. S. COMPANIES COULD STAND TO LOSE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN SALES
4b3c030p SOME U. S. CORPORATIONS COMPLAIN THAT THE MOVE HAS EVEN CAUSED CHINESE BUYERS TO RETHINK PURCHASES OF PRODUCTS THAT AREN'T AFFECTED BY THE POLICY SHIFT
4b3c030q MEANWHILE THE SECURITIES FIRM'S PARENT COMPANY PRUDENTIAL INSURANCE COMPANY OF AMERICA REPORTED MODEST GAINS IN MOST FINANCIAL CATEGORIES

4b3c0402 LEAFLETS THAT ARE BEING DELIVERED TO TWENTY THREE MILLION HOUSEHOLDS WARN THAT AIDS ISN'T LIMITED TO HOMOSEXUALS
4b3c0403 OFFICIALS SAY TELEVISION WARNINGS WILL FOLLOW
4b3c0404 HOWEVER THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION HAS ITS OWN PRIORITIES
4b3c0405 IT HAS BEEN PRESSURING GERMANY TO CUT ITS INTEREST RATES TO STIMULATE ECONOMIC GROWTH AND BY IMPLICATION CREATE A BIGGER MARKET FOR U. S. EXPORTS
4b3c0406 THIS EXPLAINS THE WAR OF WORDS OVER GERMANY'S REFUSAL TO CUT INTEREST RATES FOR MUCH OF LAST YEAR
4b3c0407 THE DISPUTE CAN BE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE AFTER THE PRESENT CENTER RIGHT COALITION GOVERNMENT OF CHANCELLOR HELMUT KOHL RECORDS ITS EXPECTED ELECTION VICTORY NEXT WEEK

4b3c0409 HAVE YOU GIVEN ANY SERIOUS THOUGHT TO DIVERSIFYING
4b3c040a MAYBE YOU SHOULD HAVE A VARIETY OF HOLDINGS IN YOUR PORTFOLIO
4b3c040b OR PERHAPS YOU SHOULD LIMIT YOUR EXPOSURE BY HEDGING
4b3c040c YOU COULD MAKE A PLAY ON BOTH SIDES OF THIS DEAL I SUGGESTED EARNESTLY
4b3c040d THE DIET IS A ONE HOUSE LEGISLATURE APPORTIONED BY DISTRICT RATHER THAN POPULATION LIKE THE SENATE AS OPPOSED TO THE HOUSE
4b3c040e THIS MEANS THAT JAPANESE FARMERS HAVE TREMENDOUS CONTROL OVER JAPANESE POLITICS
4b3c040f FOOD PRICES IN JAPAN TAKE FORTY PERCENT OR MORE OF THE AVERAGE PERSON'S WAGE
4b3c040g WITH HOUSING TAKING ANOTHER FORTY PERCENT AND THE FACT THAT THE JAPANESE ARE GREAT SAVERS THEY ARE LEFT WITH ALMOST NO DISCRETIONARY INCOME
4b3c040h THIS IS WHY THEY CANNOT DEVELOP A DOMESTIC MARKET
4b3c040i THEY DON'T HAVE MONEY TO SPEND EXCEPT A SMALL AMOUNT OF SAVINGS THAT THEY SPEND ONLY ON SPECIAL OCCASIONS OR FOR UNUSUAL BARGAINS
4b3c040j BUT MANY TIBETANS CONSIDER THE DALAI LAMA TO BE THEIR RIGHTFUL POLITICAL LEADER AS WELL SOMETHING THE CHINESE CAN'T ACCEPT
4b3c040k TRAVELERS KEPT TIBETANS WELL INFORMED OF THE DALAI LAMA'S RECENT VISIT TO THE U. S. AND HIS CALLS FOR TIBETAN INDEPENDENCE

4b3c040w THEY REFUSE TO REST AND DEMAND TREATMENT WITH ANTIBIOTICS
4b3c040x BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE FLU ANTIBIOTICS ARE USELESS

4b3c040z AS FOR PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS WALL STREET'S EUPHEMISM FOR TRIGGER HAPPY TRADING IT'S A BIT HARDER TO GAUGE THE RISKS

4b3c041h MANY TRADERS BOUGHT CONTRACTS TO COVER SHORT OR SELLING POSITIONS
4b3c041i *ANALYSTS* SAID TECHNICAL FACTORS ALSO PLAYED A PART AS PRICES BACKED AND FILLED THE GAPS LEFT ON PRICE CHARTS BY MONDAY'S STEEP DROP
4b4c0201 MR. HENKEL A FORMER ATLANTA ATTORNEY WAS APPOINTED TO THE THREE MEMBER BANK BOARD BY PRESIDENT REAGAN NOVEMBER SEVENTH

4b4c020a WHAT REMAINS FOR HISTORY TO JUDGE IS FIRST HOW WELL HE SUCCEEDED
4b4c020b HERE THE JUDGMENT MAY BE MIXED
4b4c020c WE DO HAVE LESS TAXES AND LESS INFLATION BUT BIGGER SPENDING AND AS MUCH GOVERNMENT AS BEFORE
4b4c020d HISTORY'S SECOND JUDGMENT WILL BE WHETHER HIS YEARS REPRESENT A MERE PASSING CHANGE OR WHETHER THE CHANGE WILL ENDURE
4b4c020e WE CANNOT SAY TODAY BECAUSE WE CANNOT KNOW WHAT COMES HEREAFTER AND WHAT COMES HEREAFTER WILL DECIDE MR. REAGAN'S PLACE AMONG OUR PRESIDENTS
4b4c020f SABOTEURS ARE OUR BIGGEST PROBLEM SAYS MR. CAIRO REFERRING TO THE BEVY OF PEOPLE WHO SHIELD THE DEBTOR
4b4c020g AT THE OFFICE THE COLLECTOR'S NATURAL ENEMIES ARE SWITCHBOARD OPERATORS AND SECRETARIES SO MR. CAIRO ADVISES CALLING THE DEBTOR BEFORE NINE AFTER FIVE AND DURING LUNCH
4b4c020h AT THAT TIME THE PREY HIMSELF MAY ANSWER
4b4c020i <NOISE> MR. WASHINGTON GREW UP IN CHICAGO POLITICS
4b4c020j AS A TEEN AGER HE DISTRIBUTED LEAFLETS FOR HIS FATHER ROY A PRECINCT WORKER ON THE SOUTH SIDE
4b4c020k AFTER SERVING AS AN ARMY SERGEANT ON GUAM DURING WORLD WAR TWO HE EARNED A LAW DEGREE FROM NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY
4b4c020l HIS MARRIAGE TO HIS HIGH SCHOOL SWEETHEART ENDED IN DIVORCE IN NINETEEN FIFTY ONE
4b4c020m BUT HE ADVANCED THROUGH A SERIES OF DEMOCRATIC PATRONAGE JOBS TO ELECTION TO THE STATE LEGISLATURE AND FINALLY TO CONGRESS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY
4b4c020n THE MOST ACTIVE ISSUE WAS INTEL THE BIG SEMICONDUCTOR COMPANY WHICH ROSE ONE QUARTER TO TWENTY EIGHT AND A QUARTER
4b4c020o BUT SOME OTHER BIG ELECTRONICS SHARES SURGED LATE IN THE DAY
4b4c020p S. C. I. SYSTEMS CLIMBED THREE QUARTERS TO FOURTEEN AND THREE EIGHTHS ON TWO HUNDRED AND NINE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED SHARES
4b4c020q <NOISE> THE TEXSTYRENE CASE ALSO ILLUSTRATES THE SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DREXEL AND EXECUTIVE LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY A SUBSIDIARY OF FIRST EXECUTIVE CORPORATION IN LOS ANGELES
4b4c020r DREXEL KEPT NINE MILLION DOLLARS OF THE TEXSTYRENE BONDS IT HAD BOUGHT BACK FROM ITS EMPLOYEE ACCOUNTS FOR A HUNDRED AND SIX AND A HALF FOR ONLY TWO TRADING DAYS
4b4c020s IT THEN SOLD TEN MILLION DOLLARS OF TEXSTYRENE BONDS FOR A HUNDRED AND EIGHT POINT TWO TO EXECUTIVE LIFE
4b4c020t WHEN THE FEDERAL RESERVE EARLIER THIS MONTH RAISED THE DISCOUNT RATE IT DIDN'T INCREASE ITS POPULARITY
4b4c020u G. O. P. POLITICIANS PUBLICLY DAMNED THE MOVE WITH FAINT PRAISE AND PRIVATELY WORRIED THAT THE FED WAS CREATING A RECESSION THAT WOULD WIPE OUT GEORGE BUSH
4b4c020v DEMOCRAT MICHAEL DUKAKIS WAS A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE BUT ALLOWED AS HOW HE COULD SEE THE NEED FOR THE MOVE
4b4c020w MR. BRIGHT IS A QUINTESSENTIAL TEXAS BUSINESSMAN WHOSE FORTUNES HAVE PLUNGED IN RECENT YEARS ALONG WITH THE STATE'S
4b4c020x WITH INTERESTS IN ENERGY REAL ESTATE AND BANKING MR. BRIGHT HAS HAD AN UNLUCKY HAND IN EACH OF TEXAS' MOST TROUBLED INDUSTRIES
4b4c020y <NOISE> FORBES MAGAZINE ESTIMATES THAT MR. BRIGHT'S FORTUNE HAS BEEN HALVED TO THREE HUNDRED MILLION FROM SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A FEW YEARS AGO
4b4c020z THE TROUBLED MAKER OF PRODUCTION EQUIPMENT FOR THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY DIDN'T GIVE ANY ESTIMATES OF ITS EXPECTED LOSSES AND COMPANY OFFICIALS COULDN'T BE REACHED FOR COMMENT
4b4c0210 IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN SOLITEC EARNED TWO HUNDRED AND TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS OR SIX CENTS A SHARE ON REVENUE OF THIRTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS
4b4c0211 THE RESULTS INCLUDED A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS FROM TAX BENEFITS AND DEBT RESTRUCTURING

4b4c0213 THE RESULTS INCLUDED FORTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IN INCOME FROM TAX BENEFITS
4b4c0214 TO BE SURE ON A LOT OF SCORES THE SUMMIT WAS A SUCCESS
4b4c0215 ECONOMIC COOPERATION WAS ADVANCED WITH BUSINESSMEN SIGNING AGREEMENTS FOR ABOUT THIRTY CONTRACTS AND SEVERAL JOINT VENTURES
4b4c0216 HUMAN RIGHTS TOO MAY HAVE TAKEN A STEP FORWARD IF MR. GORBACHEV LIVES UP TO HIS PROMISE TO RELEASE ALL POLITICAL PRISONERS BY YEAR'S END
4b4c0217 IN WASHINGTON SOMEONE WHO GETS CUT OFF AT THE KNEES CAN NEVER COME BACK
4b4c0218 POOR JOHN TOWER CAN'T COME BACK

4b4c021a STANDARD AND POOR'S EVENT RISK COVENANT RANKINGS WHICH WERE STARTED LAST MONTH HAVE FIVE CATEGORIES
4b4c021b E. THREE STANDS MIDWAY
4b4c021c TRADERS HAVE SAID THE BOWATER BONDS WAS THE BEST RECEIVED DEAL IN THE PAST TWO SESSIONS BECAUSE OF STRONG INVESTOR DEMAND FOR EVENT RISK PROTECTION
4b4c021d MR. MARTENS SAID VITRO WASN'T PREPARED TO AGREE TO THAT CONDITION
4b4c021e <NOISE> HE SAID APPARENTLY ANCHOR IS CONCERNED THAT THE INFORMATION IT IS OFFERING TO PROVIDE WILL GIVE VITRO A BASIS FOR LOWERING THE PRICE

4b4c0303 <NOISE> EVEN AFTER SPARE ENGINES WERE INSTALLED THIRTEEN JETS WERE GROUNDED
4b4c0304 THE REMAINING OFFSETTING COLLECTIONS OF MORE THAN THREE BILLION DOLLARS COME FROM USER FEES WHICH ALSO CLEARLY ARE NOT TAXES
4b4c0305 A USER FEE IS A SPECIFIC CHARGE FOR A DIRECT BENEFIT RECEIVED
4b4c0306 LIKE AN ASSET SALE BUT UNLIKE A TAX A USER FEE DOES NOT INVOLVE COMPULSION
4b4c0307 ONE CHARACTERISTIC OF USER FEES IS THAT THEY REVEAL HOW MUCH GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS ARE REALLY WORTH TO DIRECT RECIPIENTS IN THE MOST DIRECT AND MEANINGFUL WAY POSSIBLE
4b4c0308 ONE OF THE STRONGEST ARGUMENTS THAT A GOVERNMENT PROGRAM IS WORTHWHILE OCCURS WHEN IT HAS A USER FEE AND THE FEE COVERS COSTS
4b4c0309 THE REVERSE IS ALSO TRUE AND THAT IS ONE REASON SOME BENEFICIARIES OPPOSE USER FEES
4b4c030a THE IMPROVED RESULTS STEM LARGELY FROM GOLD SALES AT THE COMPANY'S GOLD BAR OPERATIONS IN NEVADA WHERE PRODUCTION BEGAN IN JANUARY
4b4c030b WE THINK WE CAN SUSTAIN PRODUCTION OF FORTY FIVE THOUSAND TO FIFTY THOUSAND OUNCES ANNUALLY FOR AT LEAST TEN YEARS MR. WEAVER SAID IN AN INTERVIEW

4b4c030j SOME MONTHS BEFORE THE CRASH INTEREST RATES STARTED TO MOVE UP
4b4c030k HOME MORTGAGE RATES WENT UP ALMOST TEN TIMES AS FAST AS THEY CAME DOWN
4b4c030l THE MONEY SUPPLY GROWTH WAS MUDDLING AT OR BELOW THE LOWER END OF THE TARGET RANGE A PHENOMENON WE HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED FOR MANY YEARS
4b4c030m NOW THE PROJECT'S FOCUS IS PERFECTING A HUMAN ENGINE AN ATHLETE WHO CAN FLOAT LIKE A BUTTERFLY AND PEDAL LIKE A WORKER BEE
4b4c030n THE FLIGHT FROM CRETE WILL LAST FOUR TO SIX HOURS DEPENDING ON WINDS AND OTHER FACTORS
4b4c030o THAT IS COMPARABLE TO RUNNING TWO MARATHONS NONSTOP
4b4c030p SOME ATHLETIC EVENTS ARE LONGER BUT NONE ARE SO RELENTLESSLY DEMANDING
4b4c030q IF THE MODERN DAEDALUS LETS UP EVEN FOR A FEW SECONDS HE WILL PLUNGE INTO THE SEA
4b4c030r THE EGYPTIANS WERE UNHAPPY WITH MANY OF THE RESTRICTIONS ON THEIR PARTICIPATION BUT NEVERTHELESS OPTED FOR THE M. ONE OVER ALTERNATIVES FROM BRITAIN FRANCE AND BRAZIL
4b4c030s THE BOTTOM LINE WAS THAT THEY COULD USE OUR GRANTS TO BUY IN SAID AN ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL
4b4c030t IT'S NOT GOING TO COST THEM A THING
4b4c030u BOTH SIDES HAVE WORKED HARD AND SOME PROGRESS HAS BEEN REALIZED IN A NUMBER OF AREAS SAID MESSRS.

4b4c030x <NOISE> LORENZO THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT HAS CLEARLY IMPACTED OUR TRAFFIC LEVELS AT BOTH COMPANIES PARTICULARLY IN THE EAST WHERE OUR OPPONENTS HAVE GENERATED A LOUDER NOISE LEVEL
4b4c030y WE HAVE EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THIS WILL ONLY BE TEMPORARY
4b4c030z BUT NEVERTHELESS IT WILL HAVE A FINANCIAL IMPACT ON THE RESULTS OF THE COMPANY

4b4c0404 I'M NOT A BIG FIRM KIND OF GUY HE SAID
4b4c0405 I DON'T WANT TO LIVE BY CONSENSUS
4b4c0406 IN THE BEGINNING FAYROUZ SANG ABOUT ROMANTIC LOVE AND NOSTALGIA FOR VILLAGE LIFE
4b4c0407 NOW SHE SAYS I THINK I SING FOR ALL HUMAN FEELINGS AND EMOTIONS
4b4c0408 <NOISE> PEACE LOVE NOSTALGIA MAL DU PAYS AGAINST OPPRESSION
4b4c0409 <NOISE> HE TOOK THE TAG NUMBER OF THEIR CAR MR. CLIFTON RECALLED REFERRING TO MR. MCGEE
4b4c040a AND HE CAME AND GOT ME AND SAID HEY THIS IS THE REAL THING
4b4c040b IT'S NOT A FLUKE
4b4c040c IT APPEARS TO BE TRUE
4b4c040d BURLINGTON ALSO HAS BEEN MOVING AGGRESSIVELY IN COURT TO COUNTER THE HOSTILE BID
4b4c040e <NOISE> YESTERDAY IT FILED ITS SECOND LAWSUIT AGAINST THE GROUP AND DISCLOSED THAT IT MAY TURN THE TABLES AND SEEK TO ACQUIRE CONTROL OF MONTREAL BASED DOMINION
4b4c040f THE PAC MAN DEFENSE IS NAMED AFTER THE VIDEO GAME IN WHICH A PLAYER TRIES TO GOBBLE UP HIS FOE BEFORE THE PLAYER IS SWALLOWED
4b4c040g WHILE OTHER OPEC MEMBERS RECOGNIZE THE ADVANTAGE OF GOING DOWNSTREAM MOST LACK KUWAIT'S MONEY SMALL POPULATION AND ABILITY TO MOVE FAST
4b4c040h WE CAN'T ARGUE THAT STRONGLY FOR SPENDING BILLIONS ABROAD TO BUY DOWNSTREAM FACILITIES SAYS A VENEZUELAN OIL OFFICIAL
4b4c040i OUR PEOPLE ARE STILL HUNGRY AND OUR DOMESTIC ECONOMY NEEDS THE MONEY MORE
4b4c040j L. T. V. HAS SAID REPEATEDLY SINCE ITS FILING THAT IT WOULD FIGHT ANY CREDITOR MOVE TO EITHER REORGANIZE THE UNIT SEPARATELY OR FORCE ITS SALE
4b4c040k CREDITORS ON THE OTHER HAND HAVE DISCUSSED THE IDEA ALMOST SINCE THE DAY OF L. T. V.'S FILING
4b4c040l AND THE PENSION AGENCY THE BANKS AND THE COMMITTEE REPRESENTING UNSECURED CREDITORS HAVE RECENTLY BEEN HOLDING SERIOUS DISCUSSIONS ON THE ISSUE
4b4c040m SENATOR EXON HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MOST OUTSPOKEN PROPONENTS OF BLOCKING CERTAIN FOREIGN INVESTMENT
4b4c040n WHEN FUJITSU ANNOUNCED ITS PLANS TO TAKE OVER FAIRCHILD SEMICONDUCTOR CORPORATION LAST YEAR HE WAS QUICK TO COMPLAIN
4b4c040o FAIRCHILD ACCOUNTS FOR ONLY A SMALL FRACTION OF U. S. SEMICONDUCTOR PRODUCTION AND WAS ALREADY CONTROLLED BY SCHLUMBERGER CORPORATION A LARGELY FRENCH OWNED FIRM
4b4c040p NEVERTHELESS SENATOR EXON SAID THAT THE MERGER WOULD BE DETRIMENTAL TO THE NATIONAL SECURITY
4b4c040q <NOISE> HE ALSO QUESTIONED WHETHER OPEC PRODUCTION IS AS HIGH AS IT IS THOUGHT BY MANY TO BE
4b4c040r THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF SPECULATION AS TO WHAT THE ACTUAL LEVEL IS HE SAID
4b4c040s BUT HE ADDED I HOPE THAT THIS OVERPRODUCTION IS AN ABERRATION AND NOT A TREND
4b4c040t IN THE MILITARY OR IN ANY APPOINTED LEADERSHIP POSITION YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY BY THE JOB YOU HOLD HE SAYS
4b4c040u IN POLITICS WHETHER YOU'RE RUNNING FOR OFFICE SEEKING A CLAIM OR APPROBATION YOU'VE GOT TO DEAL WITH PEOPLE WHOM YOU WOULDN'T TOLERATE FOR THIRTY SECONDS
4b4c040v YOU HAVE TO LEARN TO TOLERATE FOOLS

4b4c0410 THE PENTAGON PROPOSED INCREASING OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE ACCOUNTS BY TWO POINT FOUR PERCENT IN THE COMING FISCAL YEAR
4b4c0411 THESE PAY FOR TRAINING SHIP STEAMING HOURS AND THE COSTS OF KEEPING WEAPONS IN GOOD REPAIR
4b4c0412 <NOISE> MR. CARLUCCI EMPHASIZED THAT IT IS PREFERABLE TO KEEP A SMALLER FORCE THAT IS ADEQUATELY PAID AND READY TO FIGHT THAN TO HAVE A LARGER FORCE THAT ISN'T
4b4c0413 IT WOULD BE A DISASTER IF WE REPEAT THE EXPERIENCE OF THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES WHERE YOU KEEP THE FRAMEWORK BUT HOLLOW IT OUT HE SAID
4b4c0414 IN AFGHANISTAN HE ADDS PEOPLE HAVE STAYED IN THE ARMY BECAUSE THEY NEED TO FEED THEIR CHILDREN AND BECAUSE THEY WORRY ABOUT THEIR FAMILIES
4b4c0415 THEY JOIN OFFENSIVES BECAUSE THE SOVIETS ARE AT THEIR BACKS WITH GUNS
4b4c0416 NOW THAT THEY KNOW THEY HAVEN'T ANYONE EITHER TO PROTECT THEM OR THREATEN THEM IT WILL HAVE AN EFFECT ON MORALE
4b4c0417 BUT THIS RELIANCE ALSO RAISES THE STAKES IN THE FARMERS RACE
4b4c0418 THE WHOLE GROUP STRATEGY GOES OUT THE DOOR IF B. A. T. LOSES FARMERS SAYS PAUL *BURKE* AN ANALYST AT LONDON STOCKBROKERS KLEINWORT GRIEVESON SECURITIES
4b4c0419 AND YOU'RE PERCEIVED AS A LOSER WHICH YOU DON'T WANT TO BE IN AMERICA
4b4c041a <NOISE> THAT NEWS SENT THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE ON A GIDDY RISE OF MORE THAN FIFTY POINTS
4b4c041b BUT INVESTORS MAY NEED TO BE SHOWN MORE
4b4c041c FRIDAY'S VOLUME AFTER SUBTRACTING A BIG DIVIDEND CAPTURE TRADE WAS ONLY MODERATE AT AROUND ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION SHARES
4b4c041d WHY THIS INCREDIBLE DIVERSION OF EFFORT TO CRIMES THAT OFTEN ARE NOT CLEARLY DEFINED BY STATUTE AND WHERE IDENTIFIABLE VICTIMS ARE SELDOM FOUND
4b4c041e MAYBE TOO MANY OF TODAY'S PROSECUTORS WERE INFLUENCED BY THE PREVAILING COUNTERCULTURE SUSPICIONS OF MIDDLE CLASS MORALITY DURING THEIR LAW SCHOOL DAYS
4b4c041f BUT ANOTHER ANSWER IS SIMPLER IT IS EASIER TO EXTRACT PLEA BARGAINS FROM TRADERS WITH A MERE MENTION OF RICO THAN FROM REAL FELONS
4b5c0201 <NOISE> THE SALE OF THE HOTELS IS PART OF HOLIDAY'S STRATEGY TO SELL OFF ASSETS AND CONCENTRATE ON PROPERTY MANAGEMENT
4b5c0202 THE HOTEL OPERATOR'S EMBASSY SUITES HOTELS INC. SUBSIDIARY WILL CONTINUE TO MANAGE THE PROPERTIES
4b5c0203 LONG TERM MANAGEMENT CONTRACTS ALLOW US TO GENERATE INCOME ON A SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER CAPITAL BASE SAID MICHAEL D. ROSE HOLIDAY'S CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
4b5c0204 BUT IT WILL TAKE A LOT OF ACQUISITIONS FOR SPECIALTY RETAILING TO HAVE MUCH EFFECT ON SEARS'S BOTTOM LINE
4b5c0205 SEARS'S MERCHANDISE GROUP ALONE GENERATED PROFIT OF SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE POINT SEVEN MILLION IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE
4b5c0206 INDEED ANALYSTS SAY THAT IN THE PAST SEARS MAY HAVE BEEN HESITANT TO BUY SPECIALTY STORES BECAUSE THEY WOULDN'T QUICKLY CONTRIBUTE TO PROFIT
4b5c0207 HOWEVER A SEARS SPOKESWOMAN SAID YESTERDAY THAT THE COMPANY DOESN'T HAVE ANY QUALIFICATIONS ABOUT HOW QUICKLY OR HOW MUCH SPECIALTY ACQUISITIONS WOULD HAVE TO CONTRIBUTE TO EARNINGS
4b5c0208 MR. ELLIOTT'S LIFE STYLE WAS LUXURIANT EVEN BY UPSCALE LOCAL STANDARDS

4b5c020q MR. SHORTELL AND DOCTOR HUGHES SAY PATIENT CARE MAY HAVE BEEN HURT BY COST CUTTING IN SEVERAL AREAS SUCH AS HOSPITAL'S SLASHING OF NURSING STAFFS
4b5c020r <NOISE> THAT VIEW IS SUPPORTED BY THE AMERICAN NURSING ASSOCIATION WHICH BLAMES COST CONTAINMENT FOR EXACERBATING THE CURRENT NURSING SHORTAGE
4b5c020s MANY HOSPITALS CUT BACK ON NURSES IN THE EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTIES AND HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO RAISE SALARIES ENOUGH TO LURE THEM BACK
4b5c020t INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS LOOKING FOR SOME EXCITEMENT IN THEIR LIVES AREN'T LIKELY TO BE ENTHRALLED BY MR. BERG'S ADVICE
4b5c020u HE SUGGESTS THAT THEY DROP THEIR HARD EARNED DOLLARS INTO THE MOST CONSERVATIVE OF INVESTMENTS T. BILLS AND SIT TIGHT

4b5c0302 A GOOD FISHING BOOK WILL NEVER MATCH A JACKIE COLLINS NOVEL IN TOTAL SALES
4b5c0303 <NOISE> BUT IT WILL OUTLIVE HER RACY FICTION WITH ITS FICKLE READERS

4b5c0308 THE LOAN IS PART OF A SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR PLAN TO EXPAND THE MINE'S RESERVES AND ALLOW IT TO KEEP OPERATING UNTIL NINETEEN NINETY FOUR
4b5c0309 WITHOUT THE EXPANSION THE MINE WAS THREATENED WITH CLOSURE NEXT YEAR

4b5c0403 TO THE CONTRARY THE SPENDING MAY ACTUALLY HAVE CONSEQUENCES SUCH AS FAMILY DISSOLUTION ILLEGITIMATE BIRTHS AND CHRONIC UNEMPLOYMENT

4b6c0207 MR. BERGER CLAIMS THE PROBLEM GOES BEYOND SIMPLY RECOVERING THE COST OF IMPROVEMENTS
4b6c0208 BECAUSE THE LOFT BOARD'S REIMBURSEMENT ALLOWANCES ARE SO LOW HE SAYS BANKS WON'T MAKE LOANS FOR THE WORK
4b6c0209 HE SAYS HE FINANCED HIS IMPROVEMENTS BY TAKING A SECOND MORTGAGE ON ANOTHER BUILDING THAT HE OWNS
4b6c020a THE BOTTOM LINE HE SAYS IS THAT THESE BUILDINGS CANNOT BE MADE SAFE UNDER THESE RULES
4b6c020b THE JOB WILL NOT GET DONE
4b6c020c BOND PRICES ARE STILL SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THEY WERE BEFORE PRESIDENT REAGAN'S SURPRISE ANNOUNCEMENT TUESDAY MORNING THAT ALAN GREENSPAN WILL REPLACE PAUL VOLCKER AS CHAIRMAN OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD
4b6c020d FOR EXAMPLE THE SHEARSON LEHMAN INDEX PLUMMETED ABOUT FORTY POINTS TUESDAY AND REGAINED ABOUT TWENTY FIVE POINTS SINCE THEN

4b6c020q THE NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR RULES GOVERNING THE OPERATION OF C. R. S. SYSTEMS LED TO PUBLICATION OF UNREALISTIC SCHEDULES BY THE AIRLINES TO GET BETTER SCREEN POSITIONS
4b6c020r THIS RESULTED IN MORE DELAYS AND A LOT OF PASSENGER FRUSTRATION
4b6c020s IN RETROSPECT IT IS CLEAR THAT SUCH GOVERNMENT INTERFERENCE IN C. R. S. SYSTEMS WAS COUNTERPRODUCTIVE
4b6c020t THE CONTINUING PROSPECT OF LOWER INTEREST RATES SENT STOCK PRICES UP SHARPLY
4b6c020u THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE CLOSED UP TWENTY EIGHT POINT ONE EIGHT POINTS AT NINETEEN FIFTY EIGHT POINT TWO TWO
4b6c020v VOLUME ON THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE TOTALED TWO HUNDRED AND ELEVEN POINT NINE MILLION SHARES UP FROM THE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SIX POINT FOUR MILLION SHARES TRADED THURSDAY

4b6c020y ASKED WHETHER *MONETARY* POLICY HAS BEEN APPROPRIATE HE SAID I AM IN FUNDAMENTAL AGREEMENT WITH THE MONETARY POLICY BEING PURSUED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE
4b6c020z THE UNEMPLOYMENT NUMBERS CONFIRM THAT POLICY

4b6c0211 THE MARKETS ARE FULL OF POOR QUALITY PASTRIES MR. LI PROCLAIMED

4b6c021a THE COMPANY IS INCREASING ITS EMPHASIS ON TRUCKS WHERE ITS JEEPS AND MINIVANS ARE AMONG THE INDUSTRY'S STRONGEST SELLING VEHICLES
4b6c021b IN JUNE CHRYSLER SOLD MORE TRUCKS THAN CARS FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER AND THAT PATTERN MAY CONTINUE
4b6c021c BUT THE RIDE COULD BE BUMPY
4b6c021d SOUTH KOREAN POLITICAL UNREST COULD CURB MARKET GAINS FOR ONE THING
4b6c021e ANY SEVERE SLUMP IN THE U. S. MARKET COULD DRAG DOWN THE KOREA FUND TOO
4b6c021f CURRENCY LOSSES ALSO COULD EAT INTO RETURNS THOUGH ECONOMISTS EXPECT THE SOUTH KOREAN WON WILL RISE IN VALUE AGAINST THE U. S. DOLLAR
4b6c021g AND BUYING A FUND FOR MORE THAN ITS PORTFOLIO VALUE CAN BE TREACHEROUS SOME *ANALYSTS* SAY
4b6c0301 IN NEW YORK *STOCK* EXCHANGE COMPOSITE TRADING YESTERDAY LEAR SIEGLER SHARES ROSE A DOLLAR TWENTY FIVE TO EIGHTY THREE DOLLARS
4b6c0302 A. F. G. INDUSTRIES SHARES CLOSED AT TWENTY EIGHT POINT THREE SEVEN FIVE DOLLARS UP THIRTY SEVEN POINT FIVE CENTS
4b6c0303 WICKES SHARES FELL TWELVE POINT FIVE CENTS IN AMERICAN *STOCK* EXCHANGE COMPOSITE TRADING TO THREE POINT EIGHT SEVEN FIVE DOLLARS
4b6c0304 THE COURT BASED ITS RULING ON A SECTION OF THE LAW STATING THAT THE PROVISION WHICH COULD RESULT IN THE HIGHEST PRICE SHALL BE APPLICABLE
4b6c0305 THE PANEL NOTED THAT SINCE MARKET PRICES WERE FAIRLY HIGH WHEN THE LAW WAS PASSED THIS PROVISION SET A CEILING ABOVE WHICH REGULATED PRICES COULDN'T RISE
4b6c0306 NOW WITH MARKET PRICES LOW IT SERVES AS A PRICE FLOOR BELOW WHICH REGULATED PRICES CAN'T DROP IT SAID
4b6c0307 BUT ON TUESDAY KIDDER PEABODY'S JACK KIRNAN DROPPED CHRYSLER TO A HOLD RATING
4b6c0308 VANS AND TRUCKS ARE SELLING WELL HE CONCEDES BUT CHRYSLER'S CAR SALES HAVE BEEN VERY DISAPPOINTING

4b6c030h OTHER REPRESENTATIVES OF PUBLIC INTEREST GROUPS SAY ONE OF THE BIGGEST DRAWBACKS OF REG NEGS IS THE AMOUNT OF WORK REQUIRED USUALLY SEVERAL MONTHS

4b6c030j PENDING LEGISLATION IN CONGRESS WOULD GIVE PUBLIC INTEREST GROUPS SOME COMPENSATION FOR JOINING REG NEGS
4b6c030k AFTER DEDUCTING NONRECURRING ITEMS THE U. S. X. STEEL UNIT NONETHELESS APPEARED TO TURN IN ONE OF ITS MOST PROFITABLE QUARTERS SINCE THE NINETEEN SIXTIES

4b6c030m HOWEVER THE PERFORMANCE FELL FAR SHORT OF U. S. X. CHAIRMAN DAVID RODERICK'S PREDICTION OF A FIFTY DOLLAR PLUS PER TON PROFIT
4b6c030n <NOISE> IT'S GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT TO MANAGE SAYS A KEY PLAYER IN THE BATTLE
4b6c030o IT'S NOT A QUESTION OF MONEY BECAUSE GENERALE DE BELGIQUE IS RICH NOW
4b6c030p IT'S A PROBLEM OF CULTURE AND STYLE OF MANAGEMENT
4b6c030q NEW CAMPAIGN CO CHAIRMAN LAXALT MAY SERVE AS INTERMEDIARY WITH THE REAGANS EVEN AFTER EIGHT YEARS BUSH STILL FEELS AWKWARD TALKING TO THEM
4b6c030r SOME STRATEGISTS THINK REAGAN'S RECENT RASH OF PATENTLY PARTISAN MOVES HAS BEEN A MISTAKE
4b6c030s ONE EXPLANATION THE DESIRE OF CHIEF OF STAFF DUBERSTEIN EARLIER VIEWED AS A DOLE SUPPORTER TO INGRATIATE HIMSELF WITH BUSH
4b6c030t THE PUBLIC FILINGS SHOW THAT A FIRM CALLED CAMRO ASSOCIATES ACQUIRED A ONE PERCENT NONVOTING STAKE IN SEEMALA IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR
4b6c030u SEEMALA DISCLOSED THE CAMRO STAKE IN A PUBLIC S. E. C. FILING THAT YEAR SEEMALA DIDN'T IDENTIFY THE INVESTORS IN CAMRO
4b6c030v BUT A SEPARATE NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR FILING BY CAMRO IN CALIFORNIA IDENTIFIES CAMRO AS A GENERAL PARTNERSHIP MADE UP OF MR. *MILKEN* AND TWENTY SIX OTHER DREXEL EMPLOYEES
4b6c030w IN DECIDING TO LEAVE JOHNSON AND SWANSON MR. SWANSON SAID HE WAS LOOKING FOR A SMALLER SETTING WHERE HE COULD OFFER MORE PERSONALIZED LEGAL COUNSEL
4b6c030x HE SAID HE WILL START A SOLO PRACTICE SPECIALIZING IN FAMILY BUSINESS MATTERS AND ADVISING TRUSTEES WITH A GOAL OF EXPANDING TO AS MANY AS TEN LAWYERS
4b6c030y BOTH HE AND MR. JOHNSON SAID HIS DEPARTURE IS ON FRIENDLY TERMS

4b6c0311 IN THE LATTER THE POST OFFICE VACANCY RATE HAS HIT THIRTY TWO PERCENT AND SINGLE FAMILY HOUSING PERMITS ARE FORECAST TO DROP SEVENTEEN PERCENT THIS YEAR
4b6c0312 ACTUALLY SOMETHING RATHER LIKE THIS DOES HAPPEN BUT ONLY AMONG CERTAIN ELITE GROUPS THAT DEBATE SUCH DETAILED ISSUES
4b6c0313 AND THE DEPTH AND OPENNESS OF THIS DEBATE UNQUESTIONABLY IS A MAJOR SOURCE OF STRENGTH IN OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM
4b6c0314 THE ELITES MOREOVER ARTICULATE CHOICES AND CALL A NATION TO ITS IDEALS
4b6c0315 SOME OF THE MOST THOUGHTFUL STUDENTS OF DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT BELIEVE THAT THE UPBRINGING AND TRAINING OF DEMOCRATIC POLITICAL ELITES ARE THE KEY TO THE SYSTEM'S SUCCESS
4b6c0316 TO BE SURE THE DEFICIT HAS DECLINED IN THE PAST FEW YEARS
4b6c0317 BUT THAT DECLINE IS ENTIRELY THE RESULT OF A RISING SURPLUS IN THE SOCIAL SECURITY TRUST FUND
4b6c0318 THAT MONEY SHOULD BE INVESTED TO HELP DEFRAY THE FUTURE RETIREMENT COSTS OF THE BABY BOOMERS INSTEAD IT IS BEING USED TO PAPER OVER THE DEFICIT
4b6c0319 THAT'S YET ANOTHER SYMPTOM OF MR. DARMAN'S NATIONAL NOW NOW ISM
4b6c031a PURSUING A TIP POLICE SEIZED THE PAIR AND THE DRUGS WITH A STREET VALUE IN MUNICH OF ABOUT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS
4b6c031b BUT FOLLOW UP DETECTIVE WORK AND LEADS FROM THE U. S. DRUG ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTRATION INDICATED THIS WAS A SMALL ADVANCE SAMPLE

4b6c0403 SEVERAL MARKET MAKERS WERE SAID TO HAVE BEEN EXPECTING THE RISE ON WALL STREET TO END AND HAVE CONSEQUENTLY BEEN HOPING TO SELL SHARES IN LONDON
4b6c0404 MONDAY'S SHARP GAIN ON THE NEW YORK EXCHANGE AND TUESDAY'S HIGHER OPENING THERE CAUGHT THEM OFF GUARD
4b6c0405 BY YESTERDAY TEXACO'S EFFORTS TO RESOLVE THE SECURITY ISSUE HAD TAKEN ON THE INTENSITY OF A CORPORATE SURVIVAL MISSION
4b6c0406 A HORDE OF TEXACO LITIGATORS JOINED BY THE COMPANY'S HIGHEST RANKING EXECUTIVES HAD ESTABLISHED A HEADQUARTERS IN HOUSTON THAT ONE TEXACO LAWYER DUBBED THE WAR ROOM

4b6c040z SEARS IS ALSO FOLLOWING WARD'S FORAY INTO SELLING MORE BRANDED MERCHANDISE ESPECIALLY IN APPLIANCES
4b6c0410 AND IT IS BRANCHING OUT OF MALLS TO OPEN SMALLER NEIGHBORHOOD STORES THAT COULD WHITTLE AWAY WARD'S CUSTOMER BASE
4b6c0411 SO FAR WE'VE FOUND THAT FEDERAL EMPLOYEES HAVE DEALT WITH THIS ISSUE WITH A GREAT DEAL OF SENSITIVITY AND COMMON SENSE MRS. HORNER SAID

4b6c041b BUT HE'S GOT TO PINPOINT IT TO MAKE IT EFFECTIVE AND THAT'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO DO INNING AFTER INNING AND GAME AFTER GAME SAID DEMPSEY
4b6c041c HE WAS ABLE TO STAY IN A GROOVE LONGER THAN ANY PITCHER I'VE SEEN
4b6c041d IT'S STUDY ATTITUDE AND CONCENTRATION AND WHO KNOWS WHAT ELSE
4b6c041e ALL I KNOW IS THAT WHEREVER I PUT MY GLOVE TONIGHT THURSDAY IS MOSTLY WHERE THE BALL WENT
4b6c041f THERE ARE ALSO BROKER FINDERS THEY GET FEES MERELY FOR MATCHING BORROWERS AND LENDERS OF STOCK
4b6c041g BROKER FINDERS CAN ALSO INCLUDE THE BROKERAGE FIRMS THEMSELVES
4b6c041h THE GOVERNMENT IS INVESTIGATING WHETHER ALL THE PAYMENTS THAT FLY TO AND FROM SUCH BROKER FINDERS ARE LEGITIMATE
4b7c0201 SO WHILE THE SUBSIDIES ARE A GREAT HELP MOST FARMERS COULD PROBABLY MANAGE WITHOUT THEM
4b7c0202 YET BECAUSE FARMERS HAVE SO MUCH INFLUENCE POLITICIANS CONTINUE TO SUPPORT WHAT IS IN EFFECT A WELFARE SYSTEM FOR FARMERS
4b7c0203 BY KEEPING FOOD COSTS HIGH THE SYSTEM HURTS THE MORE NUMEROUS BUT LESS POWERFUL CITY DWELLERS
4b7c0204 MR. RIFKIN'S MODUS OPERANDI IS A HIGHLY PUBLICIZED LAWSUIT
4b7c0205 HE SUES CONSTANTLY USUALLY IN FEDERAL COURT IN WASHINGTON D. C. TO BLOCK THE PROGRESS OF BIOTECHNOLOGY
4b7c0206 AND THE ATTENDANT COVERAGE PROVIDES HIM THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPRESS HIS WELL KNOWN APOCALYPTIC FEARS ABOUT RELEASING GENETICALLY ALTERED ORGANISMS INTO THE ATMOSPHERE
4b7c0207 EVEN SO GLORIA HAS ALREADY GIVEN UP HOPE
4b7c0208 I HEAR THAT ONLY PEOPLE WITH MONEY WILL BE APPROVED SHE SAYS
4b7c0209 MY MOTHER TELLS HER IT ISN'T TRUE TO BE PATIENT
4b7c020a THE RIGHT WING UNDERWORLD ISN'T ALWAYS ON THE SIDE OF THE LANDOWNER AS THE ATTACKS ON THE SUMITOMO COMPANIES SUGGEST
4b7c020b A YEAR AGO SUMITOMO REALTY RECEIVED A BOMB THREAT AT ITS TOKYO HEADQUARTERS AND MR. ANDO THE CHAIRMAN FOUND A CARDBOARD BOX BURNING ON HIS DOORSTEP
4b7c020c THIS OCCURRED WHEN ALLEGATIONS SURFACED LINKING FORMER SUMITOMO EXECUTIVES WITH A LOAN SCANDAL INVOLVING A LAND SHARK COMPANY
4b7c020d WITH ONE EAR LAURA SLOATE LISTENS TO A MAN READING HEADLINES FROM SIX NEWSPAPERS
4b7c020e WITH THE OTHER EAR SHE MONITORS AN AIDE READING HER MAIL
4b7c020f MEANWHILE SHE IS KEEPING UP A CONVERSATION SORT OF
4b7c020g THE SUN BELT FORECAST PARTLY CLOUDY
4b7c020h ECONOMISTS EXPECT THE SOUTHEAST BUFFERED BY ITS BIG SERVICE ECONOMY TO CONTINUE TO OUTPERFORM THE NATION
4b7c020i BUT SOME OVERBUILT REAL ESTATE MARKETS COULD GET BASHED AND FLORIDA'S INFLUX OF RETIREES JOB SEEKERS AND TOURISTS COULD DWINDLE
4b7c020j CHRYSLER IS RESUMING EXPORTS TO EUROPE AFTER ITS FINANCIAL PROBLEMS IN THE LATE NINETEEN SEVENTIES FORCED IT TO LEAVE THE MARKET
4b7c020k THE COMPANY PLANS TO SHIP VERSIONS OF ITS DODGE SHADOW DODGE DAYTONA SHELBY Z. PLYMOUTH VOYAGER AND THE LEBARON SEDAN COUPE AND CONVERTIBLE
4b7c020l THE CARS WILL BE SOLD FIRST IN WEST GERMANY BELGIUM AUSTRIA THE NETHERLANDS AND SWITZERLAND
4b7c020m THE TEAM SAYS THIS KIND OF ACTION PROTECTS ITS VALUABLE PLAYERS FROM ABUSE
4b7c020n JOEY KNOWS HIS ROLE SAYS COACH DEMERS
4b7c020o HE CITES THE TIME A SAINT LOUIS PLAYER SWUNG HIS STICK AT A RED WING NOT KNOWN FOR HIS FIGHTING SKILLS
4b7c020p I TOLD JOEY TO GO OUT THERE AND TELL HIM NOT TO DO IT AGAIN SAYS THE COACH
4b7c020q THE MESSAGE GOT THROUGH IF NOT NECESSARILY IN WORDS
4b7c020r THE UNITED NATIONS WHOSE GARBAGE BILL IS FORTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH IS SERVED BY NATIONAL CARTING COMPANY WHICH WON THE PICKUP RIGHTS EIGHT YEARS AGO
4b7c020s LAST DECEMBER THE U. N. DIDN'T ATTEMPT TO SOLICIT BIDS
4b7c020t IT SIMPLY EXTENDED ITS CONTRACT WITH NATIONAL CARTING
4b7c020u SOLICITING BIDS IN THIS PARTICULAR INDUSTRY IS NOT THE WAY TO GO A U. N. SPOKESMAN SAYS IMPLYING THAT IT IS FUTILE
4b7c020v THE IMPACT WILL BE ENORMOUS
4b7c020w THE REPUBLICANS' STRONGEST CASE AGAINST THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE HIS NAIVETE ON NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUES WILL DISAPPEAR
4b7c020x THE SUSPICION OF A SELECTION BASED ENTIRELY ON POLITICAL INSTEAD OF SUBSTANTIVE GROUNDS WILL BE UNDERCUT
4b7c020y AND A MESSAGE THAT THE CURRENT VICE PRESIDENT IS LARGELY IRRELEVANT WILL BE STRONGLY DELIVERED
4b7c020z THE PUBLIC FILINGS SHOW THAT A FIRM CALLED CAMRO ASSOCIATES ACQUIRED A ONE PERCENT NONVOTING STAKE IN SEEMALA IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR
4b7c0210 SEEMALA DISCLOSED THE CAMRO STAKE IN A PUBLIC S- S. E. C. FILING THAT YEAR SEEMALA DIDN'T IDENTIFY THE INVESTORS IN CAMRO
4b7c0211 BUT A SEPARATE NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR FILING BY CAMRO IN CALIFORNIA IDENTIFIES CAMRO AS A GENERAL PARTNERSHIP MADE UP OF MR. MILKEN AND TWENTY SIX OTHER DREXEL EMPLOYEES
4b7c0212 EVEN AFTER FINDING A BUYER COMPLETING A FORECLOSURE SALE IS HARDLY ROUTINE
4b7c0213 BROKERS AT MERRILL LYNCH REALTY RECALL A SALE THAT WAS DELAYED FOR A MONTH BY A ONE MILLION DOLLAR INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE LIEN ON THE PROPERTY
4b7c0214 ANOTHER SALE WAS DELAYED WHEN THE LENDER DISCOVERED THAT THE OWNER HAD DIED BETWEEN THE TIME THE PROPERTY WAS POSTED FOR FORECLOSURE AND THE FORECLOSURE WAS COMPLETED
4b7c0215 WE WERE AT THE CLOSING TABLE WHEN THIS ALL CAME OUT SAYS WANDA HUTCHINS THE MERRILL LYNCH AGENT
4b7c0216 INVALID FORECLOSURES ARE ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS WE HAVE
4b7c0217 MR. SMILOW SAID THAT THE COMPANY WON'T HAVE TO SELL ANY ADDITIONAL ASSETS TO FINANCE A NEW BUY OUT
4b7c0218 BUT IT WILL HAVE A LOT MORE DEBT THAN IT HAD PREVIOUSLY
4b7c0219 AFTER THE BUY OUT IS COMPLETED HE SAID PLAYTEX APPAREL WILL HAVE TOTAL DEBT OF ABOUT THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS
4b7c021a PLAYTEX HOLDINGS' DEBT WILL APPROACH ONE BILLION DOLLARS
4b7c021b MR. GIULIANI DIDN'T RETURN PHONE CALLS FROM THIS NEWSPAPER YESTERDAY
4b7c021c MR. ROMANO ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE ARREST OF THE MEN IN FEBRUARY NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN WAS HASTY
4b7c021d PEOPLE FAMILIAR WITH THE SITUATION SAY TALKS BETWEEN GOLDMAN SACHS AND THE S. E. C. HAVEN'T BEGUN YET NOR HAVE TALKS BETWEEN MR. FREEMAN AND THE S. E. C.
4b7c021e AND AN ATTORNEY FOR THE FIRM LAWRENCE PEDOWITZ MAINTAINS THAT GOLDMAN ITSELF WAS BLAMELESS IN MR. FREEMAN'S WRONGDOING
4b7c021f THE FIRM HAD STATE OF THE ART COMPLIANCE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES IN EFFECT AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT MR. PEDOWITZ SAYS
4b7c021g I DON'T BELIEVE THEY WERE IN ANY RESPECT INADEQUATE
4b7c021h THERE ARE OBVIOUSLY SOME THINGS NO COMPLIANCE DEPARTMENT CAN PICK UP
4b7c0301 AND THE COMMISSION IS ATTEMPTING TO ENSURE THAT THE WEAKER DOLLAR DOESN'T KEEP AMERICANS AWAY
4b7c0302 <NOISE> WE'RE TRYING TO URGE THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY TO STABILIZE PRICES SO THAT THEY DON'T FLUCTUATE AS MUCH AS THE DOLLAR SAYS SPOKESMAN NEIL MARTIN
4b7c0303 EVEN SO SOME PRICES THOSE FOR MANY LUXURY HOTELS IN ITALY AND FRANCE FOR EXAMPLE HAVE BEEN SOARING
4b7c0304 IN THE PAST FILIPINOS IN MANY RURAL AREAS PREFERRED THE DISCIPLINED TERROR OF THE N. P. A. TO THE RANDOM EXCESSES OF THE COUNTRY'S MILITARY
4b7c0305 WITH THE CHANGE OF GOVERNMENT LAST YEAR A MILD IMPROVEMENT IN MILITARY BEHAVIOR AND THE DETECTION OF MINDANAO SLAUGHTERS SOME FILIPINOS ARE CHANGING THEIR MINDS
4b7c0306 DIPLOMATS AND POLITICAL ANALYSTS SAY THEY DON'T KNOW IF THE TREND PRESAGES SIGNIFICANT POPULAR RESISTANCE TO THE COMMUNISTS OR JUST ADDITIONAL TURMOIL IN THE PHILIPPINE COUNTRYSIDE
4b7c0307 THE S. E. C. SANCTIONS AGAINST THE FIRM AND MR. BLINDER WERE HANDED DOWN IN DECEMBER
4b7c0308 THE RULINGS STEM FROM A NINETEEN EIGHTY UNDERWRITING BY MR. BLINDER AND HIS FIRM OF AMERICAN LEISURE CORP. A CASINO COMPANY IN NEW YORK
4b7c0309 THE S. E. C. ACCUSED THE BROKERAGE OF FRAUD IN THE DEAL
4b7c030a THE LOAN IS PART OF A SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR PLAN TO EXPAND THE MINE'S RESERVES AND ALLOW IT TO O- KEEP OPERATING UNTIL NINETEEN NINETY FOUR
4b7c030b WITHOUT THE EXPANSION THE MINE WAS THREATENED WITH CLOSURE NEXT YEAR
4b7c030c CLOSURE COULD MEAN THE LOSS OF SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN JOBS
4b7c030d COSTS ARE ANOTHER PROBLEM
4b7c030e DOCTOR RESNICK SAYS ULTRASOUND SCREENINGS FOR PROSTATE CANCER CAN COST UP TO THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS COMPARED WITH TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS FOR A TRADITIONAL PROSTATE EXAM
4b7c030f ALSO HE SAYS THE ULTRASOUND PROCEDURE TAKES FIFTEEN TO THIRTY MINUTES COMPARED WITH FIVE MINUTES FOR THE TRADITIONAL METHOD
4b7c030g ALTHOUGH SUBSTANTIAL NEW TAXES ARE UNLIKELY THIS YEAR THE CURRENT DEBATE IS IMPORTANT
4b7c030h DEMOCRATS LIKE HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER JAMES WRIGHT AND MAJORITY WHIP TONY COELHO BELIEVE THEY CAN CONVINCE AMERICANS THAT PRESIDENT REAGAN HAS BEEN TOO KIND TO THE RICH
4b7c030i HOW THAT POLITICAL STATEMENT IS RECEIVED BY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND HOW IT PLAYS IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT ELECTIONS COULD DETERMINE THE NATURE OF FUTURE TAX INCREASES
4b7c030j MY CABDRIVER EYES ME IN HIS REAR VIEW MIRROR
4b7c030k HIS REACTION SEEMS A LITTLE HOSTILE BUT I DON'T CARE I AM FEELING POSITIVELY VICE PRESIDENTIAL
4b7c030l I AM ABOUT TO BECOME GEORGE BUSH FOR A NIGHT
4b7c030m YOU CAN TOO
4b7c030n ANYBODY CAN FOR A PRICE
4b7c030o WEST GERMANY IS PLAYING FOR THE LONG TERM SAYS PIERRE LELLOUCHE OF THE FRENCH INSTITUTE FOR FOREIGN RELATIONS
4b7c030p IT BELIEVES IT CAN GET EAST GERMANY BACK WITHOUT FALLING UNDER SOVIET DOMINATION ITSELF
4b7c030q MR. LELLOUCHE AND MOST OTHER FRENCHMEN DON'T THINK THIS IS POSSIBLE
4b7c030r HOW WILL THE COMPANY DEAL WITH ITS DEBT AND OPERATIONS AFTER THE CHANGE IN LEADERSHIP
4b7c030s MR.
4b7c030t STEGEMEIER IS GOING TO HAVE TO ADDRESS THAT AFTER HE BECOMES CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER THE COMPANY SPOKESMAN SAID
4b7c030u IT'S A SITUATION WHERE WE ARE LEARNING OUR WAY WITH THE ALLANTE THE SPOKESMAN SAID
4b7c030v THE CAR IS DOING THE THINGS THAT WE WANT IT TO DO FOR US AS FAR AS GETTING VISIBILITY FOR THE DIVISION AND BEING AN IMAGE CAR
4b7c030w SINCE IT'S BEEN A NEW ENTITY FOR CADILLAC AND OUR DEALERS WE WEREN'T QUITE SURE WHAT THE ACTUAL SALES VOLUME WOULD BE
4b7c030x AGFA GEVAERT IS A RIDGEFIELD PARK NEW JERSEY MAKER OF PHOTOGRAPHIC EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES THAT IS OWNED BY BAYER A. G. OF WEST GERMANY
4b7c030y AGFA GEVAERT ANNOUNCED LAST WEEK IT WOULD SEEK TO ACQUIRE THE EIGHTY NINE PERCENT OF MATRIX IT DIDN'T ALREADY OWN FOR TEN DOLLARS A SHARE
4b7c030z MATRIX SAID AT THAT TIME THAT ITS BOARD REVIEWED THE OFFER BUT THE RESULTS OF THAT REVIEW WEREN'T ANNOUNCED
4b7c0310 THE ADVERTISEMENT ANNOUNCING THE TENDER OFFER SAYS A MERGER AGREEMENT WAS REACHED BETWEEN THE TWO FIRMS LAST WEEK
4b7c0311 IT DOESN'T APPEAR THAT CABLE OWNERS WILL RESIST THE CHANGE
4b7c0312 A SPOKESMAN FOR THE NATIONAL CABLE TELEVISION ASSOCIATION SAID WE DON'T OPPOSE THE PROPOSAL IN PRINCIPLE
4b7c0313 WE TAKE THE POSITION THAT THE MORE PEOPLE IN THE CABLE MARKET THE BETTER
4b7c0314 MANY PEOPLE CRITICIZE ADS THAT GLORIFY JUNK
4b7c0315 SOME SINGLED OUT AS CONTRADICTORY A COOKING OIL AD TELLING PEOPLE HOW TO CUT DOWN ON CHOLESTEROL BUT FEATURING FRIED CHICKEN AND FRENCH FRIES
4b7c0316 IT'S ALSO DISHONEST SOME SAID TO OMIT INFORMATION OR HIDE IT IN SMALL PRINT
4b7c0317 THEY NOTED THAT ADS FOR HIGH FIBER CEREALS NEGLECT TO MENTION THEIR SALT AND SUGAR CONTENT
4b7c0318 THE MICRO CHANNEL IS OUR STRATEGY SAID BILL LOWE THE HEAD OF I. B. M.'S P. C. DIVISION
4b7c0319 WE'VE BEEN CONSISTENTLY SAYING THAT SINCE APRIL NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN WHEN THE P. S. TWO LINE WAS INTRODUCED
4b7c031a IF WE KEPT CHANGING DIRECTIONS I COULD SEE PEOPLE QUESTIONING THAT
4b7c031b WE GIVE A LOOK LIKE A GENERATION BEFORE THEM LIVED HERE SAYS MR. MARDER
4b7c031c THAT'S WORTH MONEY
4b7c031d IN THE PAST THREE YEARS ALONE THE COMPANY HAS DOUBLED ITS PROFITS AND TRIPLED ITS STAFF HE ADDS
4b7c031e SALES ARE STILL UNDER TWENTY MILLION A YEAR HE SAYS BUT THEY'RE HEADED UP
4b7c0401 ON THE BIG BOARD VOLUME ROSE TO TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY POINT FIVE MILLION SHARES FROM HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SIX POINT SIX MILLION THURSDAY
4b7c0402 BUT THE ACTIVITY WAS LESS THAN ON PREVIOUS TRIPLE WITCHING DAYS AND MUCH OF THE TRADING WAS PACKED INTO THE OPENING AND CLOSING MINUTES OF THE SESSION
4b7c0403 MORE THAN THIRTY ONE MILLION SHARES CHANGED HANDS IN THE FINAL MINUTE
4b7c0404 SEVERAL FACTORS CONTRIBUTE TO BRITISH INVESTORS' REGARD FOR THESE SERVICE COMPANIES
4b7c0405 U. S. AND BRITISH ACCOUNTING STANDARDS DIFFER FOR THE GOOD WILL ARISING FROM ACQUISITIONS YIELDING HIGHER REPORTED EARNINGS FOR BRITISH COMPANIES
4b7c0406 SOME ANALYSTS SUGGEST U. K. INVESTORS HAVE FEW HIGH GROWTH INDUSTRIES TO CHOOSE FROM AND SO LOOK FAVORABLY ON SERVICE COMPANIES
4b7c0407 THAT LEAVES RETAIL BROKERAGE FIRMS WITH A STARK CHOICE
4b7c0408 THEY CAN MOVE INTO THE INSTITUTIONAL T- FIRMS' TURF AND FIGHT FOR A TOP SPOT IN INVESTMENT BANKING
4b7c0409 OR THEY CAN SETTLE INTO THE SECOND RANK OF THE SECURITIES BUSINESS PERHAPS FOREVER
4b7c040a ASSETS OF TWO HUNDRED GENERAL PURPOSE FUNDS ROSE ONE POINT ONE FIVE BILLION DOLLARS TO SEVENTY POINT THREE SIX BILLION
4b7c040b ASSETS OF NINETY THREE BROKER DEALER FUNDS FELL THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS TO HUNDRED AND EIGHT POINT OH ONE BILLION DOLLARS
4b7c040c ASSETS OF ONE HUNDRED AND THREE INSTITUTIONAL FUNDS FELL FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS TO SIXTY SIX POINT ONE THREE BILLION DOLLARS
4b7c040d THE RIVALS HAVE DISPUTED EACH OTHER'S CIRCULATION CLAIMS FOR YEARS
4b7c040e ACCORDING TO RECENT INDUSTRY STATISTICS THE POST'S DAILY CIRCULATION IS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND THE CHRONICLE'S APPROXIMATES FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND
4b7c040f THE POST CLAIMS TO HAVE ROUGHLY FORTY PERCENT OF THE HOUSTON ADVERTISING MARKET
4b7c040g YOU DIDN'T HAVE PEOPLE HITTING THE SILKS ON THIS SAID JOHN KEEFE AN ANALYST FOR DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT INC. NEW YORK
4b7c040h YOU HAD TO EXPECT HIGHER REDEMPTIONS GIVEN ALL THE DIFFICULTY IN THE MARKET
4b7c040i BUT IT WAS CONTAINED FAIRLY WELL
4b7c040j THE PURCHASING MANAGERS SOUNDED MORE OPTIMISTIC THAN MOST ECONOMISTS IN SEVERAL RECENT SURVEYS
4b7c040k MANY ECONOMISTS FEAR THE STOCK MARKET'S COLLAPSE ON OCTOBER NINETEEN WILL MAKE SHOPPERS MORE CAUTIOUS ESPECIALLY ON SUCH MAJOR PURCHASES AS AUTOS AND HOMES
4b7c040l SOME ALSO FEAR THE STOCK MARKET'S WOES MAY PERSUADE COMPANIES TO POSTPONE CAPITAL SPENDING GAINS UNTIL A CLEAR PICTURE OF THE ECONOMY'S HEALTH EMERGES
4b7c040m NEVERTHELESS MOST ECONOMISTS STILL CONTEND THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF A RECESSION COMING ANYTIME SOON
4b7c040n TO PUNISH CURRENCY SPECULATORS THE GOVERNMENT IS ALLOWING PEOPLE TO EXCHANGE A MAXIMUM OF TEN MILLION OLD CORDOBAS
4b7c040o ANYTHING OVER THAT CAN'T BE EXCHANGED BUT MUST BE DEPOSITED IN A BANK ACCOUNT
4b7c040p THE MOVES TOOK EFFECT YESTERDAY
4b7c040q TODAY'S GAMES RELY ON COMPUTER GENERATED IMAGES
4b7c040r AS COMPUTER CHIPS HAVE BECOME MORE POWERFUL THE IMAGES HAVE BECOME MORE COMPLICATED AND VIVID BUT STILL AREN'T REALISTIC
4b7c040s UNDER DEVELOPMENT HOWEVER ARE GAMES IN WHICH THE PLAYERS INTERACT WITH VIDEOTAPE SCENES
4b7c040t THE JAPANESE FIRMS INCLUDING OURSELVES HAVE BEEN GOOD MEMBERS OF THE PRIMARY DEALER COMMUNITY SAID TOSHIO MORI CHAIRMAN OF NIKKO'S U. S. UNIT
4b7c040u WE ARE NOT A DISTURBING FORCE IN THIS MARKET AND I DON'T SEE ANY ADVANTAGE IN KICKING THREE JAPANESE FIRMS OUT FROM BEING PRIMARY DEALERS
4b7c040v WHAT IS THE ADVANTAGE FOR U. S. MARKETS AND THE U. S. ECONOMY
4b7c040w EQUICOR WAS LAUNCHED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX BY EQUITABLE AND HOSPITAL CORP. TO PROVIDE EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PROGRAMS AND TO MANAGE HEALTH CARE PRODUCTS FOR CORPORATIONS
4b7c040x AFTER POSTING TWO YEARS OF LOSSES IT BROKE EVEN IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF THIS YEAR
4b7c040y EXECUTIVES OF BOTH EQUITABLE AND HOSPITAL CORP. SAID THEY EXPECT THE VENTURE TO BE PROFITABLE THIS YEAR
4b7c040z ESTIMATES OF THE MAKEUP OF THE FEEDLOT POPULATION VARY WIDELY
4b7c0410 MOST ANALYSTS EXPECT THE GOVERNMENT TO REPORT THAT THE NUMBER OF YOUNG CATTLE PLACED ON FEEDLOTS FELL IN JULY FOR THE SECOND CONSECUTIVE MONTH FROM A YEAR EARLIER
4b7c0411 HOWEVER SOME EXPECT A RISE
4b7c0412 IN ANY CASE A RETURN TO MARKET DISCIPLINE IS INEVITABLE
4b7c0413 FINANCIAL HISTORY HAS WITNESSED A THOUSAND BOOMS AND BUSTS
4b7c0414 WITHIN RECENT MEMORY WE HAVE SEEN THE JUNK EQUITIES OF THE SIXTIES THE HEATED THIRD WORLD LENDING OF THE SEVENTIES AND THE THRIFT CRISIS OF THE EIGHTIES
4b7c0415 THESE PROBLEMS OF THE RECENT PAST PALE IN SCOPE NEXT TO THE PERVASIVENESS AND TOTAL DOLLARS INVOLVED IN THE CURRENT CRAZE
4b7c0416 IF THE PARTICIPANTS IN THIS CRAZE AWAKEN NOW THE CORRECTION MAY STILL BE WITHIN TOLERABLE LIMITS FOR THE COUNTRY
4b7c0417 IF NOT ALL OF AMERICA WILL PAY THE PENALTY BECAUSE THE DEBT IS HUGE AND WIDELY HELD AND THE BANKING STRUCTURE'S INTEGRITY WOULD BE AT STAKE
4b7c0418 ONE STUMBLING BLOCK TO INCREASED COMPETITION IS THE VERTICAL INTEGRATION AND CROSS OWNERSHIP IN THE INDUSTRY
4b7c0419 CABLE SYSTEMS OFTEN HAVE DEMANDED A STAKE IN THE CHANNELS THEY TRANSMIT
4b7c041a AN ENTREPRENEUR IS RELUCTANT TO START AN ALTERNATIVE CABLE SYSTEM IF HE KNOWS THAT HE WILL FIND IT DIFFICULT TO GAIN ACCESS TO PROGRAMMING
4b7c041b QUITE POSSIBLY SOME OF THE ANTITRUST ASPECTS OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS DESERVE A LOOK SO IT CAN BE DETERMINED WHETHER THEY ACT TO FURTHER INHIBIT COMPETITION IN THE INDUSTRY
4b8c0201 SURGING STOCK PRICES IN NEW YORK AND TOKYO AND THE PROSPECT OF LOWER WORLD WIDE INTEREST RATES FUELED THE LONDON RALLY DEALERS SAID
4b8c0202 FOREIGN INVESTMENT HAS BEEN HEAVY
4b8c0203 IT'S NOT DOMESTIC IT'S OVERSEAS A DEALER SAID ABOUT THE DAY'S BUYING
4b8c0204 FOR THE TIME BEING NEITHER SIDE PORTRAYS THE OUTLOOK AS QUITE THAT GRIM
4b8c0205 ANALYSTS SAY BOTH SPAIN AND THE U. S. WANT TO AVOID CONFRONTATION AND POINT OUT THAT WASHINGTON APPEARS CONFIDENT OF FINDING A SOLUTION
4b8c0206 NEGOTIATIONS WILL CONTINUE AT LEAST THROUGH NOVEMBER AND PERHAPS BEYOND AND MIGHT WELL ACHIEVE A COMPROMISE THE ANALYSTS SAY
4b8c0207 FOR KODAK A FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR PENALTY WOULD REPRESENT ABOUT A DOLLAR FIFTY A SHARE AFTER TAXES
4b8c0208 IT MIGHT BE SEEN AS A VICTORY FOR KODAK SAYS ALEX
4b8c0209 BROWN ANALYST OTIS BRADLEY IN A RECENT REPORT
4b8c020a YESTERDAY KODAK CLIMBED TWO AND THREE QUARTER TO SEVENTY FIVE AND THREE EIGHTHS
4b8c020b IT REPORTED FIRST QUARTER PROFIT ROSE TO SEVENTY NINE CENTS A SHARE FROM TWENTY TWO CENTS A SHARE
4b8c020c GRAINS AND SOYBEANS PRICES WERE MIXED AMID RESISTANCE TO TRADING IN TANDEM WITH FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND METALS
4b8c020d LACK OF FARMER SELLING AND FEARS OF A HOT DRY SUMMER BOOSTED SOYBEAN FUTURES
4b8c020e THE STRENGTH IN THE SOYBEAN CONTRACT FOR DELIVERY AFTER THE HARVEST HELPED SEPTEMBER CORN RISE SLIGHTLY AS DID WORRIES ABOUT THE SUMMER WEATHER
4b8c020f <NOISE> WHEAT FUTURES WERE MIXED
4b8c020g <NOISE> WHILE OTHER OPEC MEMBERS RECOGNIZE THE ADVANTAGE OF GOING DOWNSTREAM MOST LACK KUWAIT'S MONEY SMALL POPULATION AND ABILITY TO MOVE FAST
4b8c020h WE CAN'T ARGUE THAT STRONGLY FOR SPENDING BILLIONS ABROAD TO BUY DOWNSTREAM FACILITIES SAYS A VENEZUELAN OIL OFFICIAL
4b8c020i OUR PEOPLE ARE STILL HUNGRY AND OUR DOMESTIC ECONOMY NEEDS THE MONEY MORE
4b8c020j <NOISE> HERE ARE PRICE TRENDS ON THE WORLD'S MAJOR STOCK MARKETS AS CALCULATED BY MORGAN STANLEY CAPITAL INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE GENEVA
4b8c020k TO MAKE THEM DIRECTLY COMPARABLE EACH INDEX IS BASED ON THE CLOSE OF NINETEEN SIXTY NINE EQUALING ONE HUNDRED
4b8c020l THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE IS SINCE YEAR END
4b8c020m HE ALSO RELIED HEAVILY ON ADVERTISING RATHER THAN ON DIRECT MAILING WHICH IS BY FAR THE MOST COMMON WAY FOR NEWSLETTERS PUBLISHERS TO SOLICIT SUBSCRIBERS
4b8c020n THIS UNUSUAL STRATEGY EVOLVED FROM A SMALL AD PLACED IN A BUSINESS MAGAZINE
4b8c020o THE NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLAR AD GENERATED ENOUGH SUBSCRIPTIONS TO PAY FOR ITSELF IN A WEEK SO MR. KOBREN BEGAN ADVERTISING IN OTHER PUBLICATIONS
4b8c020p <NOISE> OF HIS COMPANY'S ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN OPERATING EXPENSES LAST YEAR FULLY HALF WENT FOR MARKETING

4b8c020t MR. HAMM WHO WAS HERE TO MEET WITH SOME OF HIS CLIENTS AMONG THE OPEC COUNTRIES SAID SUPPLY AND DEMAND IN THE OIL MARKET IS BALANCED
4b8c020u BUT HE SAID IT'S BALANCED AT FIFTEEN DOLLARS TO SIXTEEN DOLLARS A BARREL
4b8c020v THAT IS TWO DOLLARS TO THREE DOLLARS A BARREL LESS THAN THE EXPORTERS WERE RECEIVING LAST YEAR
4b8c020w IF THERE IS A REDUCTION IN SUPPLY AS A RESULT OF THE JOINT MEETINGS PRICES WILL SHOOT UP MR. HAMM SAID

4b9c020t CREDIT CARD BORROWING SOARED BY TWO POINT THREE TWO BILLION OR AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF NINETEEN POINT FOUR PERCENT
4b9c020u A FED ECONOMIST SUGGESTED THIS LARGE INCREASE MAY REFLECT SLOWER GROWTH EARLIER IN THE YEAR AS CONSUMERS USED HOME EQUITY LOANS TO PAY OFF CREDIT CARD BALANCES
4b9c020v ALL THE INCREASES ARE SEASONALLY ADJUSTED
4b9c020w THE NORMALLY PLODDING SEARS IS NOW COPYING WARD'S SPECIALTY STORE SCHEME

4b9c0219 G. O. P. POLITICIANS PUBLICLY DAMNED THE MOVE WITH FAINT PRAISE AND PRIVATELY WORRIED THAT THE FED WAS CREATING A RECESSION THAT WOULD WIPE OUT GEORGE BUSH
4b9c021a DEMOCRAT MICHAEL DUKAKIS WAS A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE BUT ALLOWED AS HOW HE COULD SEE THE NEED FOR THE MOVE
4b9c021b IN THE POSITION I'M IN I COULD RAISE A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY IN TEN DAYS MORE THAN I WOULD NEED HE SAYS
4b9c021c BUT I WON'T DO IT
4b9c021d I WOULD BE DEFEATED BEFORE I WOULD ACCEPT CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS
4b9c021e EVER SINCE HE TOOK OFFICE THREE AND A HALF YEARS AGO MR. GORBACHEV HAS SOUGHT TO INCREASE FOREIGN TRADE'S MEAGER SHARE OF THE SOVIET ECONOMY
4b9c021f RATHER THAN SIMPLY IMPORT MORE WESTERN GOODS HE WOULD LIKE TO OBTAIN THE MACHINERY AND KNOW HOW TO ENABLE THE SOVIETS TO MAKE THE GOODS THEMSELVES
4b9c021g TO DO SO HE OPENED UP THE ECONOMY TO FOREIGN CAPITAL AND EQUIPMENT BY PERMITTING JOINT VENTURES
4b9c0301 THE S. E. C. SAYS ITS RULE PROHIBITS SHAREHOLDERS WHO PARTICIPATE IN A TENDER OFFER FROM MAKING ADDITIONAL PROFITS BY SIMULTANEOUSLY SELLING SHORT OTHER STOCK IN THE COMPANY
4b9c0302 IN A SHORT SALE A HOLDER SELLS BORROWED STOCK THAT HE AGREES TO REPLACE LATER
4b9c0303 IN EFFECT THE HOLDER IS BETTING THAT THE PRICE OF THE COMPANY'S STOCK WILL DROP ALLOWING HIM TO PROFIT BY REPLACING THE STOCK WITH CHEAPER STOCK
4b9c0304 WHAT IF ANYTHING WILL COME OF ALL OF THIS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN REMAINS TO BE SEEN OF COURSE
4b9c0305 THE YEAR ALSO MAY YIELD ANSWERS TO SOME OTHER QUESTIONS CURRENTLY PUZZLING INVESTORS WILL THE ECONOMY FINALLY GET MOVING AGAIN

4b9c030e BUT THE DIFFICULTY OF THE TASK CANNOT DISCOURAGE US FROM FACING UP TO OUR RESPONSIBILITIES
4b9c030f FOR WHAT IS THE ALTERNATIVE

4b9c030n THE ONLY REQUIREMENT IS THAT YOU HAVE TO BE AN ADULT TO RECEIVE THE MAGAZINE SAYS MARY TAYLOR ASSOCIATE PUBLISHER
4b9c030o THAT'S NOT BECAUSE OF RACY ARTICLES BUT BECAUSE THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF TRYING TO SNATCH TWELVE AND THIRTEEN YEAR OLDS

4b9c0312 MR. REICHLER LAUNCHED A LOBBYING BLITZ AMONG U. S. LIBERALS ARGUING THAT THE AID WOULD HELP STEM VIOLATIONS
4b9c0313 THE POLICE GOT TWO MILLION FOR TRAINING AND GUATEMALA ALSO GOT SEVEN MILLION IN MILITARY ASSISTANCE
4b9c0314 THE MEASURE WAS A BOLD MOVE FOR A PRESIDENT WHO HAS COME TO VIEW INERTIA AS THE BEST FORM OF SECURITY
4b9c0315 THE SUSPENSION EFFECTIVELY WILL SLASH SALARIES AND CUT AN ESTIMATED EIGHT POINT THREE BILLION FROM FEDERAL SPENDING THIS YEAR
4b9c0316 THE AIM IS TO HOLD THE BUDGET DEFICIT TO FOUR POINT NINE PERCENT OF ECONOMIC OUTPUT DOWN FROM A PROJECTED SEVEN PERCENT
4b9c0317 THIS IT IS HOPED WILL HELP STOP HIGH INFLATION FROM SPIRALING INTO HYPERINFLATION
4b9c0318 IN TAIPEI THERE WERE NEWSPAPER REPORTS THAT THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE TURNED DOWN A PROPOSAL TO ALLOW BUSINESS BANKS TO SET UP BRANCHES IN OTHER CITIES

4b9c040a IN ADDITION THE PAY NETWORKS ARE CUTTING THE PRICES THEY CHARGE OPERATORS
4b9c040b THAT MAY SIGNAL THAT EQUITY LINKED EUROBONDS AREN'T GOING TO DISAPPEAR EVEN IF EQUITIES FALL OUT OF INVESTOR FAVOR
4b9c040c DIFFICULT MARKETS WON'T END THE GAME SAYS A SYNDICATION OFFICIAL FOR ONE LARGE U. S. INVESTMENT HOUSE
4b9c040d WE'LL JUST ADAPT THE PRODUCT

4b9c040z THE PLAN WAS CAREFULLY CONSTRUCTED TO CONFORM WITH THE CONSERVATIVE GRADUALIST PRINCIPLES OF THE EXISTING BAKER PLAN DEVISED BY FORMER SECRETARY BAKER
4b9c0410 THAT APPROACH FEATURES A MENU OF OPTIONS BY WHICH BANKS AND DEBTOR COUNTRIES MIGHT VOLUNTARILY NEGOTIATE NEW LOANS OR REDUCTIONS IN DEBT
4b9c0411 THE PLAN OPPOSES GOVERNMENT ASSUMPTION OF BANK RISK OR BAILOUTS AND STRESSES NEW LENDING OVER DEBT RELIEF
4b9c0412 THE GANGS ARE EVEN BECOMING ADEPT AT THEIR OWN SORT OF PUBLIC RELATIONS-

4bac020g HER HUSBAND AN EDITOR AND OCCASIONAL NEWSPAPER COLUMNIST BASED AT THE NORWEGIAN INSTITUTE FOR NATIONAL AFFAIRS IS A CONSERVATIVE
4bac020h INDIRECTLY AT LEAST WHAT HE WRITES IS OFTEN CRITICAL OF HER POLICIES A SITUATION THAT VISITING JOURNALISTS INVARIABLY ASK HER ABOUT
4bac020i HE WENT TO SAY THAT SINCE THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES CHINA HAD DECIDED TO PROMOTE ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL EXCHANGES WITH THE U. S. AND JAPAN
4bac020j BUT NO MIRACLE IS GOING TO APPEAR
4bac020k ISN'T THIS OBVIOUS
4bac020l A BIG COMPANY WOULD JUST HAVE CONTINUED WITH THE SAME BAD TEAM HE EXPLAINS
4bac020m THEY WASTE HUGE AMOUNTS
4bac020n THAT'S WHY WE AREN'T AT A DISADVANTAGE WITH THEM
4bac020o MR. ADELMAN SAYS THAT CLEARLY SERVES MOSCOW
4bac020p ARMS CONTROL SERVES THE SOVIETS MORE THAN IT SERVES US BECAUSE IT MAKES US MORAL EQUIVALENTS HE SAYS
4bac020q JUST THROUGH A PRESS RELEASE THEY CAN GIVE THE IMPRESSION THEY FAVOR PEACE
4bac020r HE ALSO POINTS OUT THAT NUCLEAR ARMS TALKS ARE ALSO WHERE MOSCOW BARGAINS FROM A POSITION OF STRENGTH BECAUSE OF ITS CONVENTIONAL MILITARY SUPERIORITY
4bac020s THE DEPRESSION WASN'T JUST ONE LONG SLUMP AS THE POPULAR IMAGE HAS IT BUT A SERIES OF *RECOVERIES* ABORTED BY FURTHER RECESSIONS
4bac020t THESE SLUMPS WITHIN THE SLUMP IN NINETEEN THIRTY THREE AND NINETEEN THIRTY EIGHT WERE BOTH PRECEDED BY LARGE INCOME TAX INCREASES
4bac020u THIS FOLLY HAS NOT PASSED UNNOTICED BY KEYNESIANS
4bac020v HERBERT STEIN EXCLAIMED IN HIS NINETEEN SIXTY NINE BOOK THE FISCAL REVOLUTION IN AMERICA
4bac020w THE CONTINUING PROSPECT OF LOWER INTEREST RATES SENT STOCK PRICES UP SHARPLY

4bac0216 THE SALE ANNOUNCEMENT WAS NOT WIDELY EXPECTED
4bac0217 BUT DESPITE THE ELEMENT OF SURPRISE THE NEWS HAD LITTLE NET EFFECT ON THE SECONDARY MARKET FOR NEW YORK BONDS
4bac0218 THERE ISN'T ENOUGH SUPPLY FOR THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE SIZABLE OFFERING TO HAVE MUCH IMPACT EXPLAINED ONE TRADER
4bac0219 I KNOW BUT IT'S CLOSE
4bac021a ANOTHER IMPORTANT THING IS THIS
4bac021b BEING A LIBERAL IS NOT LIKE BEING A DEMOCRAT
4bac021c BEING A DEMOCRAT OR A REPUBLICAN IS LIKE HAVING THE RED PIECES OR THE BLACK PIECES IN A CHECKERS GAME
4bac021d IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY MORAL IMPLICATIONS
4bac021e BEING A LIBERAL IS BA:D
4bac021f YOU CAN BE A GOOD DEMOCRAT IF YOU'RE NOT LIBERAL AND YOU CAN BE A BAD REPUBLICAN IF YOU ARE LIBERAL

4bac030c ABOUT TWO THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED HOURLY WORKERS ARE ON TEMPORARY LAYOFF AS A RESULT OF THE CLOSING CHRYSLER SAID
4bac030d MR. ELLIOTT'S LIFE STYLE WAS LUXURIANT EVEN BY UPSCALE LOCAL STANDARDS

4bac030y I'M A LITTLE SCARED
4bac030z I DON'T BLAME PEOPLE FOR NOT BEING HEROES
4bac0310 THINGS ARE A BIT DULLER THIS YEAR
4bac0311 MR. BILZERIAN HAS SENT HIS BOY TO A LITTLE LEAGUE TEAM IN FARAWAY MINNESOTA WHERE THE FAMILY SPENDS ITS SUMMERS AND ISN'T COACHING A TEAM THIS YEAR
4bac0312 ALL THE ACTION APPARENTLY WILL BE IN THE COURTROOM
4bac0313 MR. DUKAKIS IS IN FACT A FIRST GENERATION AMERICAN
4bac0314 HIS FATHER PANOS ARRIVED IN NEW YORK IN NINETEEN TWELVE AT THE AGE OF SIXTEEN
4bac0315 HIS MOTHER ARRIVED A YEAR LATER WHEN SHE WAS NINE
4bac0316 HE IS STRIKING NOW AT A TIME WHEN FINANCING FOR BIG DEALS IS READILY AVAILABLE AND THE STOCK PRICE IS DOWN
4bac0317 AS RECENTLY AS AUGUST R. J. R.'S STOCK WAS TRADING LOWER THAN ITS FORTY NINE DOLLAR LEVEL WHEN MR. JOHNSON TOOK OVER IN JANUARY NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
4bac0318 <NOISE> THE OFFER FOR A LEVERAGED BUY OUT PROBABLY WILL BE AT ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS A SHARE AND NOW OTHER TOBACCO STOCKS ARE SOARING TOO
4bac0319 FOR EXAMPLE THREE YEAR TREASURY NOTES AS OF LATE YESTERDAY YIELDED ABOUT EIGHT POINT SIX NINE PERCENT
4bac031a THAT'S LESS THAN A THIRD OF A PERCENTAGE POINT BELOW THE APPROXIMATELY NINE PERCENT YIELD AVAILABLE ON A THIRTY YEAR TREASURY BOND
4bac031b I DON'T THINK THERE'S ENOUGH INCENTIVE TO INVESTORS TO REACH OUT AND BUY LONG TERM TREASURYS AT NINE PERCENT MR. *FROEHLICH* SAID
4bac031c ONE OF THE AFFINITY CARDS THAT CHEMICAL BANK DROPPED WAS MARKETED TO ALUMNI OF NEW YORK UNIVERSITY
4bac031d WE WERE SATISFIED WITH THE PROGRAM WHILE IT WAS RUNNING SAYS ROBERT CUNNINGHAM DIRECTOR OF ALUMNI RELATIONS AT N. Y. U.
4bac031e BUT IT ENDED AT CHEMICAL'S SUGGESTION
4bac0401 THE AUTO MAKER SAID THE WAGON VERSION OF THE MEDALLION WILL HAVE A BASE PRICE OF TEN THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND NINETY THREE DOLLARS
4bac0402 THE L. X. VERSION OF THE SEDAN WILL START AT TEN THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE DOLLARS
4bac0403 THE MEDALLION BUILT IN FRANCE IS A FRONT WHEEL DRIVE CAR WITH AN ALUMINUM ENGINE
4bac0404 EXCO A UNIT OF BRITISH AND COMMONWEALTH HOLDINGS P. L. C. IS ONE OF THE WORLD'S BIGGEST BROKERS OF INTERBANK AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE DEPOSITS
4bac0405 UNDER THE AGREEMENT BANK OF NEW YORK COMPANY WOULD REDUCE ITS FIFTY POINT ONE PERCENT HOLDING IN R. M. J. TO TEN PERCENT
4bac0406 R. M. J. SENIOR OFFICIALS WHO OWN FORTY NINE POINT NINE PERCENT OF THE BROKER'S EQUITY WOULD CUT THEIR HOLDINGS TO TEN PERCENT
4bac0407 REAGAN SAID IT WAS TIME TO MOVE ON FROM INSIDE WASHINGTON POLITICS
4bac0408 THE PRESIDENT'S COMMENTS CAME A DAY AFTER HE CONCEDED THAT HIS IRAN POLICY WAS A MISTAKE
4bac0409 THE WHITE HOUSE MEANWHILE SOUGHT TO REGAIN POLITICAL MOMENTUM AND BEGAN WEIGHING SUCH IDEAS AS A BUDGET SUMMIT AND A REAGAN SPEAKING TOUR
4bac040a A FACTORY WORKER LOUNGES IN A STEAMING HOT TUB INSTALLED IN THE BACK OF A CAR
4bac040b ANOTHER MAN DISPLAYS MUSICAL BATH SLIPPERS
4bac040c A CROWD GATHERS AROUND AN AUTOMOTIVE ENGINEER WHO IS MAKING A FIG TREE DANCE TO THE MUSIC OF KAREN CARPENTER
4bac040d THE EXPECTED FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS WOULD GIVE THE COMPANY PROFIT OF TEN TO TWELVE CENTS A SHARE FOR ALL OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
4bac040e IT POSTED PROFIT OF TWENTY SEVEN CENTS A SHARE FOR NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX INCLUDING ABOUT FOURTEEN CENTS A SHARE FROM AN ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENT
4bac040f THE COMPANY DIDN'T MAKE ESTIMATES FOR THE NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN NET INCOME
4bac040g HERE ARE PRICE TRENDS ON THE WORLD'S MAJOR STOCK MARKETS AS CALCULATED BY MORGAN STANLEY CAPITAL INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE GENEVA

4bac040i THE *PERCENTAGE* CHANGE IS SINCE YEAR END
4bac040j BEFORE FRIDAY IT SEEMED THAT ONLY AN UNEXPECTED BREAK IN THE DELAWARE COURT CASE COULD HAVE EXTRACTED HENLEY FROM THE DILEMMA IT NOW FACES
4bac040k THUS THE CASE WAS CLOSELY WATCHED
4bac040l BUT IT ALSO RAISED IMPORTANT ISSUES OF CORPORATE LAW
4bac040m THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THESE WAS A CONTENTION THAT SANTA FE'S BOARD ACTED ILLEGALLY LAST DECEMBER WHEN IT LOWERED THE THRESHHOLD FOR A SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN TO TWENTY PERCENT
4bac040n PREVIOUSLY THE RIGHTS OR POISON PILL WERE TRIGGERED AUTOMATICALLY ONLY FIFTY PERCENT OF THE STOCK WERE IN HOSTILE HANDS
4bac040o THE LEGITIMATE RIGHT OF GOVERNMENT TO PRESCRIBE PENALTIES FOR FRAUD IS WELL UNDERSTOOD IN LAW WHEN A GOOD OR OR SERVICE IS INVOLVED
4bac040p LAWS AGAINST FRAUD SHOULD BE NO LESS APPLICABLE TO PLANT CLOSINGS OR MASS LAYOFFS
4bac040q IN SHORT GOVERNMENT SHOULD SEEK TO ENSURE THAT EMPLOYERS LIVE UP TO THEIR LEGAL OBLIGATIONS AND SHOULD PROVIDE FOR LEGAL REMEDIES WHEN THEY DO NOT
4bac040r BUT SUPPORTERS OF TARGETED MAIL SOLICITATION SAY THAT EVEN IF SOME LETTERS ARE IN BAD TASTE AT LEAST THEY ARE FROM LAWYERS SEEKING TO WORK ON THE VICTIMS' BEHALF
4bac040s <NOISE> VICTIMS ARE *BARRAGED* WITH COME ON LET'S SETTLE SOLICITATIONS FROM INSURANCE COMPANY AND AIRLINE LAWYERS RIGHT AFTER THE CRASH SAYS MR. SHAPERO
4bac040t THAT'S EVEN WORSE BECAUSE THOSE LAWYERS AREN'T EVEN ON THE VICTIM'S SIDE
4bac040u MR. MINOLI THE U. S. GENERAL MANAGER SAYS BENETTON RECENTLY DROPPED ITS STRATEGY OF SATURATING THE MARKET WITH SMALL STORES
4bac040v NOW IT IS CONCENTRATING ON PROFESSIONALISM AND THE SERVICING OF EXISTING STORES HE SAYS
4bac040w NEW STORES WILL BE LARGER OUTLETS CALLED UNITED COLORS AND WILL OFFER A MUCH BROADER RANGE OF MERCHANDISE
4bac040x BENETTON PLANS TO HAVE TEN UNITED COLORS SHOPS OPERATING IN THE U. S. BY NEXT SPRING
4bac040y MR. MINOLI ALSO ESTIMATES THAT AS MANY AS ONE HUNDRED SMALLER BENETTON STORES MAY CLOSE IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS
4bac040z JOINT VENTURE PROJECTS THAT ARE STILL UNDER NEGOTIATION ARE TO BE SCRUTINIZED CHINESE OFFICIALS SAY
4bac0410 THOSE INVOLVING CONSTRUCTION OF HOTELS OR OFFICE BUILDINGS AREN'T LIKELY TO WIN GOVERNMENT APPROVAL
4bac0411 CHINA IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO APPROVE MOST INVESTMENTS IN EXPORT RELATED INDUSTRIES AND IN PROJECTS COVERING ENERGY TRANSPORTATION COMMUNICATIONS RAW MATERIALS AND CHEMICALS
4bac0412 SUEZ WHICH HAD TO RAISE ITS CAPITAL SEVERAL TIMES LAST YEAR THROUGH RIGHTS ISSUES TO FUND ITS BELGIAN W- BATTLE SAYS IT CAN FUND ITS ACQUISITION OF C.
4bac0413 INDUSTRIELLE OUT OF ITS CASH HOARD E- OR THROUGH SHORT TERM LOANS
4bac0414 ONE SOURCE SAYS SUEZ IF VICTORIOUS WOULD LIKELY RESELL PART OF ITS STAKE IN C.
4bac0415 INDUSTRIELLE TO RECOUP PART OF ITS COSTS
4bac0416 IT COULD ALSO SELL OFF C.
4bac0417 INDUSTRIELLE ASSETS SUCH AS REAL ESTATE AND MINORITY INDUSTRIAL HOLDINGS ESTIMATED AT BETWEEN ONE BILLION AND TWO BILLION *FRANCS*
4bac0418 <NOISE> THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE ON A SEVEN TO SEVEN VOTE LAST MONTH EFFECTIVELY KILLED MR. LUCAS'S NOMINATION TO HEAD THE DEPARTMENT'S CIVIL RIGHTS DIVISION
4bac0419 A MAJORITY WAS NEEDED TO SEND THE NOMINATION TO THE FULL SENATE
4bac041a DEMOCRATIC MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CRITICIZED PRESIDENT BUSH AND MR. THORNBURGH FOR NOMINATING MR. LUCAS WHO HAS LITTLE EXPERIENCE AS A LAWYER AND NONE AS A CIVIL RIGHTS LITIGATOR
4bac041b COMPANIES LISTED BELOW REPORTED QUARTERLY PROFIT SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE AVERAGE OF ANALYSTS' ESTIMATES
4bac041c THE COMPANIES ARE FOLLOWED BY AT LEAST THREE ANALYSTS AND HAD A MINIMUM FIVE CENT CHANGE IN ACTUAL EARNINGS PER SHARE
4bac041d ESTIMATED AND ACTUAL RESULTS INVOLVING LOSSES ARE OMITTED
4bbc0201 GAINS FROM ASSET SALES COULD OFFSET THE BANK'S INCREASED LOAN LOSS PROVISIONS IN LATER QUARTERS
4bbc0202 MELLON'S INTERIM CHIEF EXECUTIVE NATHAN PEARSON TOLD SHAREHOLDERS AT THE BANK'S ANNUAL MEETING MONDAY THAT HE EXPECTS MELLON TO RETURN TO PROFITABILITY THIS YEAR
4bbc0203 BUT SEVERAL PROFITABLE MELLON BUSINESSES INCLUDING TRUST OPERATIONS AND DATA PROCESSING COULD BE SWAMPED BY CONTINUED LOSSES FROM ENERGY AND REAL ESTATE LOANS
4bbc0204 AND YET THIS HAPLESS FELLOW HAD THE GUTS TO SUE HIS FATHER AND THE AMBITION TO GRAB FOR CONTROL OF THE CORPORATION THAT BEARS HIS NAME
4bbc0205 HE IS MOST ELUSIVE
4bbc0206 IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO HE TOURED NEW YORK'S TAKEOVER HOUSES BLITHELY CHATTING ABOUT GETTY'S PROBLEMS
4bbc0207 WAS HE NAIVELY SEEKING ADVICE OR WAS HE SUBTLY SHOWING THAT HE WAS WILLING TO GO OUTSIDE THE FIRM FOR ALLIES TO OUST THE CURRENT MANAGEMENT
4bbc0208 TWO DESIRABLE RESULTS ARISE FROM PLACING CORPORATE GOVERNANCE DECISIONS AS CLOSE TO THE SHAREHOLDERS AS POSSIBLE
4bbc0209 FIRST THE DECISION MAKERS CLOSEST TO THE ISSUE ARE LIKELY TO HAVE THE BEST INFORMATION WITH WHICH TO MAKE DECISIONS
4bbc020a SECOND THE OPPORTUNITY ARISES FOR EXPERIMENTATION WITH DIFFERENT RULES OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
4bbc020b MR. TRUMP WASN'T AVAILABLE FOR COMMENT YESTERDAY
4bbc020c INDUSTRY SOURCES HAVE DISPUTED HIS CLAIM THAT HE HOLDS THAT LARGE A GOLDEN NUGGET STAKE AS WELL AS ANY TAKEOVER THREAT
4bbc020d STEPHEN A. WYNN GOLDEN NUGGET'S CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER HAS DENIED THAT THE BUY BACK IS DEFENSIVE
4bbc020e HE WASN'T AVAILABLE FOR COMMENT YESTERDAY
4bbc020f WHAT'S MORE A FURTHER DROP IN THE DOLLAR COULD HAVE THE VERY RESULT MR. BAKER SEEKS TO AVOID HIGHER INTEREST RATES
4bbc020g IN ORDER TO KEEP PERSUADING FOREIGN INVESTORS TO HOLD CHEAPER DOLLARS THE FEDERAL RESERVE MUST KEEP U. S. INTEREST RATES HIGHER THAN THOSE ABROAD
4bbc020h AN EVEN WEAKER DOLLAR COULD REQUIRE HIGHER RATES
4bbc020i CERTAINLY GOVERNMENT CONTROLLED TELEVISION HAS HAD A ROLE IN THAT TRANSFORMATION
4bbc020j MR. ROH'S STRATEGISTS SAY KOREANS HAVE TEN TIMES MORE TELEVISION SETS SOME TEN MILLION THAN IN THE LAST PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS IN NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE
4bbc020k THUS A RECENT KIM YOUNG SAM RALLY THAT ATTRACTED A CROWD OF ONE MILLION AT HIS HOME TOWN OF PUSAN WAS A SECONDARY NEWS ITEM ON THE NIGHTLY NEWS
4bbc020l SEVERAL SMALLER PARTY MEETINGS ATTENDED BY MR. ROH LED THE BROADCAST
4bbc020m ROBERTSON REMAINS THE BIGGEST THREAT ON THE RIGHT AS KEMP STRUGGLES TO SURVIVE
4bbc020n THE RELIGIOUS BROADCASTER HOPES FOR A SURPRISE SHOWING IN ONE OF BUSH'S HOME STATES MAINE
4bbc020o BUT IN SOUTH CAROLINA HE FAILS TO WIN THE BACKING OF FUNDAMENTALISTS SURROUNDING BOB JONES UNIVERSITY THEY LOOK ASKANCE AT CHARISMATIC PRACTICES SUCH AS SPEAKING IN TONGUES
4bbc020p I CAN'T GUARANTEE OUR GROUP IS ONE HUNDRED PERCENT SOLID SAID AN OFFICIAL AT SUEZ A FRENCH HOLDING COMPANY
4bbc020q I CAN'T TELL YOU THAT AT THOSE PRICES THERE WON'T BE ANY RENEGING ON AGREEMENTS SIGNED BY THE CONSORTIUM'S MEMBERS
4bbc020r BUT HE ADDED SUCH ACTION COULD LEAD TO LEGAL REPRISALS
4bbc020s NAVY WARSHIPS AND AIRCRAFT SEARCHED FOR A MISSING U. S. HELICOPTER IN THE SOUTHERN PERSIAN GULF AS IRAN ATTACKED TWO COMMERCIAL VESSELS
4bbc020t THE GUNSHIP CARRYING TWO CREW MEMBERS FAILED TO RETURN TO A CRUISER FOLLOWING MONDAY'S RAIDS ON IRANIAN OIL PLATFORMS AND VESSELS
4bbc020u THE PENTAGON ALSO SAID SEVERAL MINES WERE FOUND IN THE AREA
4bbc020v THE SHAREHOLDER DAVID F. LAROCHE A PROVIDENCE RHODE ISLAND INVESTOR FILED THE SUIT IN A STATE SUPERIOR COURT IN NEWPORT
4bbc020w THE SUIT REQUESTS THE COURT TO ISSUE ORDERS PROHIBITING THE PROPOSED ACQUISITION AND REQUIRING NECO TO HOLD ITS ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS TO ELECT FOUR DIRECTORS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
4bbc020x A SUPERIOR COURT JUDGE DECLINED TO ISSUE A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER REQUESTED BY THE SUIT TO BLOCK THE ACQUISITION SAID A COURT CLERK
4bbc020y CHECKOUT COUNTERS ARE PRIMARY IMPULSE BUYING SITUATIONS SAYS WILLARD BISHOP A FOOD RETAILING CONSULTANT
4bbc020z AND THERE'S TREMENDOUS COMPETITION FOR ATTENTION NOT ONLY FROM OTHER MAGAZINES BUT FROM ITEMS LIKE CANDY TOBACCO AND RAZOR BLADES MR. BISHOP ADDS
4bbc0210 THAT'S WHY MAGAZINE EXECUTIVES SAY COVERS HAVE TO REACH OUT AND GRAB BUYERS
4bbc0211 FEDERAL OFFICIALS ARE PARTICULARLY PLEASED WITH THE DOLLAR'S NEW FOUND STRENGTH
4bbc0212 THEY SEE IT AS A VOTE OF CONFIDENCE IN THEIR CONDUCT OF MONETARY POLICY IT REDUCES THE THREAT OF INFLATION AND EASES PRESSURE FOR FURTHER INTEREST RATE INCREASES
4bbc0213 ECONOMIST DAVID HALE SAYS THE DOLLAR'S STRENGTH IS DIMMING THE PROSPECT OF AN EIGHTY NINE RECESSION AS WELL AS AN EIGHTY EIGHT FINANCIAL CRISIS
4bbc0214 I JUST WANTED TO TAKE A MINUTE TO THANK YOU FOR RUNNING ALEXANDER COCKBURN'S VIEWPOINT COLUMN
4bbc0215 HIS COLUMNS OFTEN PROVIDE A FRESH SLANT ON THE MAJOR ISSUES OF THE DAY
4bbc0216 HIS IDEAS ARE OFTEN CONTRARY TO POPULAR OPINION BUT THEY PROVIDE NEW IDEAS TO BROADEN THE READER'S OWN PERSPECTIVE
4bbc0217 FRANKFURT SHARE PRICES CLOSED MOSTLY LOWER IN MODERATELY ACTIVE TRADING FRIDAY AS AN EARLY RALLY FIZZLED AMID POSITION SQUARING BEFORE THE WEEKEND AND UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE LOWER DOLLAR
4bbc0218 THE DAX INDEX DROPPED FIVE POINT FOUR NINE TO TWELVE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY NINE POINT SEVEN TWO
4bbc0219 AFTER OPENING BROADLY HIGHER THE TIDE TURNED AT MIDDAY WHEN THE DOLLAR'S SLIDE TO A THREE MONTH LOW BEGAN TO WORRY MARKET PARTICIPANTS
4bbc021a THE DOLLAR WAS CONFINED TO FAIRLY NARROW RANGES IN ASIAN AND EARLY EUROPEAN TRADING AS MARKET PARTICIPANTS CONCENTRATED ON MARK YEN TRADING
4bbc021b THE GERMAN CURRENCY TRADED IN A RANGE BETWEEN SEVENTY THREE POINT THREE YEN AND SEVENTY THREE POINT SIX FIVE YEN THROUGH MOST OF NEW YORK TRADING
4bbc021c AT THE NEW YORK FINISH THE MARK WAS UNCHANGED AT SEVENTY THREE POINT FOUR SIX YEN
4bbc021d SO WHAT IS WALL STREET TELLING THE QUEASY INVESTORS THAT HOLD SHARES IN GENERIC DRUG MAKERS
4bbc021e IN ESSENCE DON'T WORRY
4bbc021f TAKE TWO ASPIRIN AND CALL ME IN A FEW YEARS
4bbc0301 THAT DECISION CAME EASILY
4bbc0302 NOW HE'S WORKING AMID THE METAL FOLDING CHAIRS IN HIS TRANSITION OFFICE IN THE AUSTERE CHAMBER OF THE SENATE EDUCATION COMMITTEE
4bbc0303 HIS FIRST BUDGET MUST GO TO THE PRINTER TWO DAYS AFTER HE'S INAUGURATED
4bbc0304 BANKS WEREN'T THE ONLY ONES *EXCLUDED* FROM THE PRIVATE TALKS
4bbc0305 STEPHEN D. SUSMAN ONE OF THE HUNTS' LEAD ATTORNEYS SAID HE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THE DISCUSSIONS UNTIL HE STARTED HEARING THE OTHER BANKS' OBJECTIONS
4bbc0306 BUT MR. SUSMAN SAID HE ISN'T TROUBLED BY THE MEETINGS
4bbc0307 IT SEEMS LIKE GOOD SENSE TO ME
4bbc0308 INTELLIGENT PEOPLE IN LITIGATION OUGHT TO BE TALKING TO PEOPLE TO TRY TO RESOLVE IT HE SAID
4bbc0309 THE BANKS SOUGHT TO ELIMINATE A MISMATCH BETWEEN THEIR ASSETS PREDOMINANTLY HELD IN NON POUND CURRENCIES AND THEIR CAPITAL KEPT IN POUNDS
4bbc030a WHEN THE POUND WAS WEAK DURING THE EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTIES THE VALUE OF SCANDINAVIAN BANK'S CAPITAL FELL STEEPLY IN PROPORTION TO ITS NON DOLLAR ASSETS
4bbc030b THE BANKS THAT OWNED SCANDINAVIAN BANK HAD TO INJECT ABOUT FORTY SEVEN POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS OF ADDITIONAL CAPITAL
4bbc030c THE ALTERED MEMO HOWEVER NEVER MENTIONED THE PRESIDENT
4bbc030d INSTEAD IT RECOMMENDED ONLY THAT THE CURRENT DONORS BE APPROACHED TO PROVIDE FIFTEEN TO TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS ADDITIONAL
4bbc030e AT THE TIME SAUDI ARABIA ALREADY HAD CONTRIBUTED THIRTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS TO THE CONTRAS
4bbc030f WE HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO DEFER MEDIUM AND LONG RANGE FINANCING SAYS MR. BLAKELY
4bbc030g IN FACT WE JUST REVIEWED THIS SUBJECT AND DECIDED TO WAIT UNTIL LATER THIS YEAR
4bbc030h STILL HE ADDS I THINK WE'RE HEADED FOR HIGHER RATES IN THE LONG TERM HOWEVER
4bbc030i AS FOR THE SECURITIES INDUSTRY IT IS SEEKING TO RETAIN THE REMAINING LINE OF DEFENSE AGAINST BANK INTRUSIONS
4bbc030j INVESTMENT BANKERS WARN OF CONFLICTS OF INTEREST AND SELF DEALING IF COMMERCIAL BANKERS ARE ALLOWED TO COMPETE DIRECTLY WITH THEM
4bbc030k DESPITE THE BANKERS' DIRE WARNINGS THEY ARGUE THE CIRCUMSTANCES DON'T CALL FOR CHANGING THE HALF CENTURY OLD SYSTEM
4bbc030l THE SKY ISN'T FALLING SAYS ROBERT GERARD THE HEAD OF MORGAN STANLEY GROUP INCORPORATED'S MUNICIPAL FINANCE DIVISION
4bbc030m SECURITIES UNDERWRITING ISN'T THE ANSWER FOR ENERGY AND AGRICULTURAL LOANS
4bbc030n THE JOURNAL'S CLIFFORD KRAUSS LAST MONTH DESCRIBED THE DEEP ANTIPATHY AMONG THE LOCAL POPULATION TOWARD THE POLICIES AND SURVEILLANCE TECHNIQUES OF THE SANDINISTAS' INTERNAL TRADE MINISTRY
4bbc030o IN THE AMERICAS COLUMN PUBLISHED ON THIS PAGE LAST FRIDAY DOUGLAS PAYNE DESCRIBED NICARAGUA'S GROWING ECONOMIC INTEGRATION WITH THE SOVIET BLOC

4bbc030x THOSE COMPANIES INCLUDE THE ACURA DIVISION OF HONDA MOTOR CORPORATION B. M. W. OF NORTH AMERICA INCORPORATED VOLVO OF AMERICA CORPORATION AND PORSCHE CARS OF NORTH AMERICA
4bbc030y INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS LOOKING FOR SOME EXCITEMENT IN THEIR LIVES AREN'T LIKELY TO BE ENTHRALLED BY MR. BERG'S ADVICE
4bbc030z HE SUGGESTS THAT THEY DROP THEIR HARD EARNED DOLLARS INTO THE MOST CONSERVATIVE OF INVESTMENTS T. BILLS AND SIT TIGHT
4bbc0310 THERE'S NO SENSE TRYING TO PLAY GAMES WITH THIS MARKET MR. BERG EXPLAINS
4bbc0311 MARKEL CORPORATION OFFERING OF EIGHT HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND COMMON SHARES
4bbc0312 OF THE TOTAL SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND SHARES WILL BE SOLD BY THE COMPANY AND THE BALANCE VIA SMITH BARNEY HARRIS UPHAM AND COMPANY AND ALEX
4bbc0313 BROWN AND SONS INCORPORATED
4bbc0314 IN THE EVENT THIS DANGER WAS AVERTED
4bbc0315 AFTER RECOVERING PART OF ITS LOSS IN THE FIRST FEW DAYS AFTER OCTOBER NINETEENTH THE MARKET SPUTTERED OUT THE YEAR WITH A PERSISTING SENSE OF CRISIS
4bbc0316 IN THE FIRST WEEK OF JANUARY THE WORLD CENTRAL BANKS INTERVENED MASSIVELY TO SUPPORT THE DOLLAR AND BACKED UP THE INTERVENTIONS WITH ADJUSTMENTS IN BASIC MONETARY POLICY
4bbc0317 THE TREASURY BUNDESBANK RIFT WAS OBVIOUSLY RESOLVED AND INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION RESTORED
4bbc0318 THE SENSE OF CRISIS DISSIPATED AND THE MARKET STARTED THE GRADUAL CLIMB TO ITS CURRENT LEVELS
4bbc0319 IN SOME CASES CONSUMERS CAN CHOOSE AMONG AS MANY AS FIFTEEN GENERIC VERSIONS OF A BRAND NAME PRESCRIPTION DRUG
4bbc031a WE AREN'T PICKING ON ANY PARTICULAR MANUFACTURER SAID IRENE CARO ACTING F. D. A. DISTRICT DIRECTOR IN LOS ANGELES

4bbc031c PERRY LEVINE HAS SAID HE WOULD RETIRE ONCE A SUCCESSOR HAS BEEN FOUND
4bbc031d JEFFREY LEVINE IS ON LEAVE FROM THE BOARD
4bbc031e NEITHER HAS BEEN CHARGED WITH ANY CRIME
4bbc0401 THIS VARIABILITY IN FIT HAS ALSO BEEN EVIDENT IN THE MERGERS OF OTHER SOUTHEASTERN BANKING COMPANIES
4bbc0402 EACH BANKING COMPANY YOU MENTIONED HAS MOVED TO PLACE ITS EXECUTIVES IN KEY POLICY JOBS IN ORDER TO EFFECT THE TRANSFER OF CULTURE POLICY AND PROCEDURES TO ACQUIRED BANKS

4bdc0215 RICK BRIGGS PRESIDENT OF THE UNION SAID FALCONBRIDGE'S LATEST PROPOSAL ON CONTRACTING OUT ARE NOT ENCOURAGING
4bdc0216 THE PROPOSALS WERE PRESENTED YESTERDAY AFTER A TWO DAY RECESS IN THE TALKS
4bdc0217 ABOUT FORTY PERCENT OF FALCONBRIDGE'S NICKEL OUTPUT COMES FROM ITS *SUDBURY* OPERATIONS
4bdc0218 I'D NEVER OWNED A SHARE NEVER EVEN KNEW WHAT A DIVIDEND OR S- THE STOCK EXCHANGE IS HE SAYS
4bdc0219 NOW I FOLLOW PRICES EVERY DAY IN THE PAPER
4bdc021a WHEN I COMPARE WHAT I HAVE TO WHAT I HAD IN NINETEEN SEVENTY I HAVE NO DOUBT I WILL VOTE YES HE SAYS
4bdc021b WE HAVE DEFEATED AN AUTHORITARIAN SYSTEM <NOISE>
4bdc021c NOW COMES THE HARD PART THAT OF REBUILDING DEMOCRACY SAYS RICARDO *LAGOS* A SOCIALIST
4bdc021d HOW QUICKLY AND PEACEFULLY THAT PROCESS OCCURS IS AMONG MANY QUESTIONS THAT WEDNESDAY'S STUNNING PLEBISCITE LEFT UNANSWERED
4bdc021e THE SUGGESTED RETAIL PRICE FOR CINDERELLA IS TWENTY SIX DOLLARS AND NINETY NINE CENTS AND FOR E. T. TWENTY FOUR DOLLARS AND NINETY FIVE CENTS
4bdc021f BUT BOTH HAVE BEEN HEAVILY DISCOUNTED BY AS MUCH AS NINE DOLLARS A CASSETTE AND BOTH HAVE REBATE OFFERS
4bdc021g THE HOME VIDEO INDUSTRY IS HOPING THE MASSIVE PURCHASES OF BOTH CASSETTES WILL TURN MANY CASSETTE RENTERS INTO AT LEAST OCCASIONAL BUYERS IN THE FUTURE
4bdc0301 INDEED TO INVESTORS ALL SHARES OF THE SAME STOCK ARE ALIKE THE INVESTOR DOESN'T CARE WHICH ONE HE BUYS
4bdc0302 BUT TWO EXAMPLES OF THE SAME STAMP ISSUE CAN DIFFER GREATLY IN VALUE DEPENDING ON THE QUALITY OF SAY PERFORATIONS INK OR GLUE
4bdc0303 BUYING STAMPS THROUGH A COMPUTER NETWORK SIGHT UNSEEN COULD BE HAZARDOUS
4bdc0304 FED OFFICIALS SOUND RELUCTANT TO EASE CREDIT FURTHER FOR NOW DESPITE SPECULATION OF A DISCOUNT RATE CUT
4bdc0305 I THINK THE ECONOMY IS DOING PRETTY WELL SAYS ONE MEMBER OF THE FED'S OPEN *MARKET* COMMITTEE
4bdc0306 WE'RE IN A WATCH AND WAIT PERIOD SAYS ANOTHER MEMBER WHO CITES EARLY SIGNALS THAT THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR IS STARTING TO PICK UP
4bdc0307 MR. WALTER WOULD BE RICH IF NOT FOR HIS AWFUL BUSINESS SENSE SAYS HIS BROTHER DANIEL A MARKETING EXECUTIVE
4bdc0308 MY MOTHER SAYS GO HELP YOUR BROTHER
4bdc0309 I SAY THE ONLY WAY I COULD HELP HIM IS WITH A GARBAGE TRUCK TO HAUL AWAY THE OLD COMPUTER MANUALS THAT LITTER HIS APARTMENT
4bdc030a THE COMPANY ALSO SAID BOYD W. HENDRICKSON CARE'S PRESIDENT AND CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER PLANS TO RESIGN NOT LATER THAN JULY FIRST
4bdc030b ACCORDING TO PROXY MATERIAL FOR THE CARE ANNUAL MEETING HELD HERE YESTERDAY HE ALSO PLANS TO RESIGN AS A DIRECTOR
4bdc030c A SUCCESSOR HASN'T BEEN SELECTED
4bdc030d MR. HENDRICKSON FORTY *TWO* YEARS OLD SAID HE IS LEAVING TO START HIS OWN NURSING HOME CONCERN
4bdc030e THE F. C. C. REJECTED PETITIONS FROM SEVERAL PARTIES MAINTAINING THAT THE STATIONS SHOULD BE SOLD TO SOMEONE WITH CLOSER TIES TO THE HISPANIC COMMUNITY THAN HALLMARK
4bdc030f HALLMARK HOWEVER HAS SAID IT WOULD CONTINUE THESE STATIONS IN THE SPANISH LANGUAGE FORMAT
4bdc030g THE F. C. C. SAID THE CONCERNS OVER FUTURE PROGRAMMING WERE IRRELEVANT TO THE TRANSFER
4bdc030h BANC ONE CORP. COLUMBUS OHIO AGREED IN PRINCIPLE TO ACQUIRE UNIVERSAL CORP. A MICHIGAN BANK HOLDING COMPANY FOR STOCK VALUED AT THIRTEEN MILLION
4bdc030i UNDER TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT UNIVERSAL SHAREHOLDERS WILL RECEIVE TWO SHARES OF BANC ONE COMMON FOR EACH OF THEIR SHARES
4bdc030j <NOISE> UNIVERSAL THE PARENT OF THE NATIONAL BANK OF YPSILANTI HAS ONE HUNDRED AND SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN ASSETS AND EIGHT BRANCHES IN THE ANN ARBOR AREA
4bdc030k UNIVERSAL WOULD BE THE FOURTH MICHIGAN BANKING CONCERN ACQUIRED BY BANC ONE A BANK HOLDING COMPANY
4bdc030l INCLUDING UNIVERSAL BANC ONE'S MICHIGAN BANKS WOULD HAVE ASSETS OF ABOUT SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS
4bdc030m BANC ONE HAS ASSETS OF SEVENTEEN POINT SEVEN FOUR BILLION DOLLARS
4bdc030n MR. SCHWIND WHO SAID HIS FIRM HOLDS THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND CITICORP SHARES ASKED IS THIS THE FIRST AND LAST STAGE
4bdc030o IT WOULDN'T SURPRISE ME IF CITICORP DID ANOTHER ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN TWO YEARS' TIME
4bdc030p BUT DON HOWARD CITICORP'S CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER SAID WE THINK THIS IS GOING TO DO IT FOR QUITE A WHILE
4bdc030q MR. ADELMAN SAYS THAT CLEARLY SERVES MOSCOW
4bdc030r ARMS CONTROL SERVES THE SOVIETS MORE THAN IT SERVES US BECAUSE IT MAKES US MORAL EQUIVALENTS HE SAYS
4bdc030s JUST THROUGH A PRESS RELEASE THEY CAN GIVE THE IMPRESSION THEY FAVOR PEACE
4bdc030t HE ALSO POINTS OUT THAT NUCLEAR ARMS TALKS ARE ALSO WHERE MOSCOW BARGAINS FROM A POSITION OF STRENGTH BECAUSE OF ITS CONVENTIONAL MILITARY SUPERIORITY
4bdc030u MY CABDRIVER EYES ME IN HIS REAR VIEW MIRROR
4bdc030v HIS REACTION SEEMS A LITTLE HOSTILE BUT I DON'T CARE I AM FEELING POSITIVELY VICE PRESIDENTIAL
4bdc030w I AM ABOUT TO BECOME GEORGE BUSH FOR A NIGHT
4bdc030x YOU CAN TOO
4bdc030y ANYBODY CAN FOR A PRICE
4bdc030z RATHER THAT WASN'T A QUESTION
4bdc0310 IT WAS A STATEMENT
4bdc0311 MAY I ASK A QUESTION ABOUT
4bdc0312 WHILE FORMER EXECUTIVE BRANCH OFFICIALS FACE JAIL FOR NON CRIMES CONGRESS IS ABUSING THE JUDICIAL PROCESS IN SEEKING IMMUNITY FROM LIBEL SUITS
4bdc0313 THE U. S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE D. C. CIRCUIT HELD LAST NOVEMBER THAT CONGRESSMEN CAN BE SUED FOR STATEMENTS MADE OUTSIDE CONGRESS
4bdc0314 LAWYER STEVEN ROSS WHOSE BOSS IS HOUSE SPEAKER JIM WRIGHT APPEALED TO THE ENTIRE CIRCUIT WITH NO SUCCESS
4bdc0315 BUT ROBERT BORK HAS LEFT THE COURT SO MR. ROSS WILL TRY AGAIN
4bdc0316 THE CIRCUIT HAS NEVER GRANTED A SECOND TRY BUT MR. ROSS SEEMS TO THINK IT'S WORTH ANOTHER SHOT
4bdc0317 THE CLINCHER CRITICS SAY IS THE COMPARISON WITH FORDS BUILT AFTER NINETEEN EIGHTY
4bdc0318 FOR THEM THE DEATH COUNT IS DOWN AS MUCH AS FIVEFOLD AND MORE LIKE OTHER CARS'
4bdc0319 FOR NINETEEN EIGHTY AND LATER VEHICLES FORD REDESIGNED CERTAIN TRANSMISSION PARTS
4bdc031a BUT WHEN THE SUBJECT IS FARMING HE CAN'T MASK HIS DISAPPOINTMENT
4bdc031b I THOUGHT I'D BE IN A HECK OF A LOT BETTER POSITION BY NOW HE SAYS
4bdc031c BEFORE THE DROUGHT I THOUGHT WE HAD A GOOD SHOT AT A GOOD YEAR
4bdc031d THE BOND *ISSUANCE* PROVISION IS PART OF A CONTROVERSIAL TAX BILL
4bdc031e AS OF LATE YESTERDAY THAT BILL APPEARED STALLED ANALYSTS SAID
4bdc031f IF CONGRESS DOESN'T ACT SOON THE TREASURY WON'T BE ABLE TO ISSUE NEW LONG TERM BONDS UNTIL EARLY NEXT YEAR
4bdc0401 THE LACK OF MARKET DEPTH YESTERDAY ENABLED SEVERAL LARGE BUY ORDERS TO SPARK THE DOLLAR RALLY
4bdc0402 ONE NEW YORK TRADER SAID HE WITNESSED THE CURRENCY'S VALUE JUMP AS HIS BANK EXECUTED A PURCHASE ORDER FOR TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN SEVERAL CHUNKS
4bdc0403 WHEN THERE ARE VERY FEW PLAYERS THAT KIND OF ORDER WILL MOVE THE MARKET SAID THE TRADER WHO ASKED NOT TO BE IDENTIFIED
4bdc0404 THE BIGGEST DANGER ECONOMISTS SAID IS A FREE FALL OF THE DOLLAR
4bdc0405 THAT WOULD FORCE THE U. S. TO RAISE INTEREST RATES TO ATTRACT THE FOREIGN CAPITAL NEEDED TO FINANCE ITS CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT AND INDIRECTLY ITS BUDGET DEFICIT
4bdc0406 HIGHER RATES IN TURN COULD PLUNGE THE U. S. AND POSSIBLY THE WORLD INTO A RECESSION THAT COULD THREATEN THE INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL SYSTEM
4bdc0407 THE REVIEW COMMITTEE TRIES TO OFFER A MENU OF SMALL MEDIUM AND LARGE CAPITALIZATION STOCKS
4bdc0408 SOME OF ITS MOST SUCCESSFUL PICKS WERE QUITE SMALL COMPANIES WHEN FIRST RECOMMENDED
4bdc0409 MONEY MANAGERS MINDING BILLION DOLLAR PORTFOLIOS ON THE OTHER HAND OFTEN AVOID SMALLER STOCKS BECAUSE THEY CAN'T PURCHASE A SIGNIFICANT STAKE WITHOUT AFFECTING THE PRICE
4bdc040a S:OME EXPERTS SAY THAT BECAUSE OF SWEEPING TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY COULDN'T BE RE REGULATED EVEN IF PEOPLE WANTED
4bdc040b BUT THE CONTINUING DECONTROL OF THIS AREA ALSO SHOWS THAT THE REGULATORY RESURGENCY IS SELECTIVE
4bdc040c WHILE RULES ARE REVIVED TO DEAL WITH PUBLICIZED CONCERNS SUCH AS AIR AND RAIL SAFETY THE GOVERNMENT PULLBACK CONTINUES IN SUCH AREAS AS CONSUMER PROTECTION AND ANTITRUST ENFORCEMENT
4bdc040d TWO DESIRABLE RESULTS ARISE FROM PLACING CORPORATE GOVERNANCE DECISIONS AS CLOSE TO THE SHAREHOLDERS AS POSSIBLE
4bdc040e FIRST THE DECISION MAKERS CLOSEST TO THE ISSUE ARE LIKELY TO HAVE THE BEST INFORMATION WITH WHICH TO MAKE DECISIONS
4bdc040f SECOND THE OPPORTUNITY ARISES FOR EXPERIMENTATION WITH DIFFERENT RULES OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
4bdc040g THE IRAN CONTRA COMMITTEE ENDED ITS HEARINGS YESTERDAY IN A TORRENT OF MEMBERS' SPEECHES ABOUT LIES AND DECEIT
4bdc040h CONGRESS NOW TURNS TO ITS REWRITE OF THE GRAMM RUDMAN LAW WHICH HAS TARGETED THE FISCAL NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT DEFICIT AT A HUNDRED AND EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS
4bdc040i THE TARGET WILL BE RAISED BECAUSE MEMBERS IT SEEMS ARE NOT PREPARED TO KEEP THE SPENDING CUT PROMISES MADE WHEN IT WAS SET
4bdc040j NEVERTHELESS SOME ANALYSTS SAY THE FED ALREADY MAY BE TIGHTENING CREDIT SLIGHTLY
4bdc040k THEY POINT TO THE RECENT INCREASES IN THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE WHICH IS THE RATE ON RESERVES THAT BANKS LEND EACH OTHER OVERNIGHT
4bdc040l THE FUNDS RATE AVERAGED ABOUT SEVEN AND FIVE EIGHTHS PERCENT YESTERDAY AND TUESDAY UP FROM AN AVERAGE OF SEVEN POINT THREE FOUR PERCENT IN THE WEEK ENDED OCTOBER SEVENTH
4bdc040m THESE ANALYSTS ARGUE THAT THE *INCREASE* WAS ENGINEERED BY THE FED
4bdc040n BRAZIL UNILATERALLY STOPPED PAYING INTEREST ON AN ESTIMATED SIXTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS OF FOREIGN BANK DEBTS LAST FEBRUARY TWENTIETH
4bdc040o IT CITED WEAKENED FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND GOLD RESERVES
4bdc040p SINCE THEN ITS MEDIUM TERM AND LONG TERM FOREIGN BANK DEBT HAS CLIMBED TO MORE THAN SEVENTY BILLION DOLLARS INCLUDING INTEREST ARREARS
4bdc040q SO FAR THE EXECUTIVE SAYS HE HAS SIGNED UP FIFTY TWO FIELD ORGANIZATIONS REPRESENTING ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED AGENTS
4bdc040r BY YEAR'S END HE EXPECTS HIS AGENT INVESTOR GROUP COULD NUMBER TWO THOUSAND
4bdc040s HE ALSO HAS LURED THREE FORMER EXECUTIVES WHO WORKED WITH HIM AT I. T. T.'S UNIT
4bdc040t ABANDONING A NUCLEAR POWER PLANT COST A UTILITY A BUNDLE
4bdc040u BUT STATE REGULATORS APPROVED A RATE INCREASE TO COVER THE COSTS
4bdc040v NOW THE I. R. S. RULES THAT THE UTILITY IS ALSO ENTITLED TO A LOSS DEDUCTION FOR THE COSTS OF THE ABANDONED PLANT
4bdc040w A MERGER WITH MACY WHICH IS ROUGHLY HALF THE SIZE OF FEDERATED COULD BE ATTRACTIVE TO THE LARGER RETAILER'S EXECUTIVES
4bdc040x MACY'S SMALLER SIZE COULD LEAVE FEDERATED'S OFFICERS WITH OPERATING POWER IN A COMBINED CONCERN
4bdc040y AND FEELINGS AT FEDERATED HAVE RUN HIGH AGAINST CAMPEAU WHICH SURPRISED THE COMPANY WITH A HOSTILE BID LAST MONTH
4bdc040z <NOISE> HOWEVER CAMPEAU'S BID IS ALL CASH AND THE MACY BID ISN'T
4bdc0410 INSTITUTIONALIZING AUDITING WOULD ALSO HELP REDUCE TAX EVASION
4bdc0411 <NOISE> IF ACCOUNTING BECOMES INSTITUTIONALIZED IT WOULD ENABLE THE STATE TO COLLECT TAXES MORE EFFICIENTLY SAYS *HAKAN* ONCE A MANAGER OF ARTHUR YOUNG'S OFFICE IN ISTANBUL
4bdc0412 NEARLY HALF OF ALL TAXABLE REVENUES GOES UNTAXED ACCORDING TO TURKEY'S FEDERAL TAX AUTHORITY
4bdc0413 <NOISE> BUT AMERICAN EXPRESS INSISTS IT HAS NO INTENTION OF DOING THAT
4bdc0414 THE ANSWER IS NO
4bdc0415 NOT WHILE I'M HERE SAYS EDWIN COOPERMAN PRESIDENT OF AMERICAN EXPRESS'S CONSUMER CARD GROUP
4bdc0416 THE SAME MENTALITY AFFECTED THE PHYSICAL STRUCTURE OF THE STORES MR. GARCIA SAID
4bdc0417 HE OWNS THIRTY SEVEN BURGER KINGS IN FLORIDA BUT HE REFUSES TO PUT UP THE BUILDING THAT IS CURRENTLY APPROVED BY BURGER KING
4bdc0418 IT LOOKS LIKE A MATCHBOX
4bdc0419 SOCIALIST REVOLUTION THE CARD READ
4bdc041a THE STUDENTS FLASH A COLORFUL REPRESENTATION OF THE KOREAN FLAG
4bdc041b AND THEN IN A PERFECTLY SYNCHRONIZED MOVE LONG LIVE THE *GREAT* LEADER KIM IL SUNG
4bec0201 THE COMPUTER ALSO CAN DISPLAY A PATTERN SHOWING HOW PEOPLE NORMALLY PLACE THE TONGUE TO PRODUCE AN S. SOUND
4bec0202 A DEAF PERSON CAN THEN TRY TO MATCH THE PATTERN BY PLACING THE TONGUE AGAINST THE ELECTRONIC PALATE
4bec0203 WITH CAREFUL COACHING AND TRIAL AND ERROR CHILDREN LIKE MISS GILROY CAN LEARN HOW TO MAKE SOUNDS THAT REQUIRE PLACING THE TONGUE AGAINST THE ROOF OF THE MOUTH
4bec0204 HOLIDAY WAS ALSO *VULNERABLE* BECAUSE IT HADN'T MUCH CHANGED AND CONSUMERS HAD
4bec0205 THEY WERE MORE SOPHISTICATED AND WIDELY TRAVELED
4bec0206 THEY DEMANDED MORE INSTEAD OF GETTING BETTER MANY HOLIDAY INNS HAD GONE DOWNHILL
4bec0207 SOME WERE QUITE *VEHEMENT* IN RESISTING ANY CHANGE
4bec0208 IF A COMPANY DID THIS I WOULDN'T FOLLOW THEM ANYMORE SAID ONE NEW YORK ANALYST
4bec0209 ISSUERS OF ABBREVIATED ANNUAL REPORTS ARE REALLY SHOWING CONTEMPT FOR THE TYPICAL SHAREHOLDER SAID ANOTHER
4bec020a THE U. S. COTTON INDUSTRY IS COST COMPETITIVE WITH THE MAJOR PRODUCING COUNTRIES BUT NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF THE FOREIGN COTTON PRODUCED IS SUBSIDIZED
4bec020b OUR MAJOR COMPETITORS INCLUDE SUCH NON MARKET ECONOMIES AS CHINA AND RUSSIA
4bec020c WITHOUT U. S. GOVERNMENT INVOLVEMENT OUR MARKETS ARE FORFEITED
4bec020d INTERNATIONAL LEASE FINANCE CORP. IS OFFERING FIVE HUNDRED SHARES OF TRANSFERABLE PREFERRED STOCK AT A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS EACH
4bec020e THE SHARES CARRY AN INITIAL ANNUAL DIVIDEND RATE OF FOUR POINT SIX TWO FIVE PERCENT
4bec020f A NEW RATE WILL BE SET JUNE EIGHTH AND EVERY FORTY NINE DAYS THEREAFTER THROUGH A DUTCH AUC:TION SAID SALOMON BROTHERS INCORPORATED HEAD UNDERWRITER
4bec020g <NOISE> IN A DUTCH AUCTION THE SHARES ARE BOUGHT AND SOLD AT FACE VALUE ONLY THE DIVIDEND RATE IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE
4bec020h INTERNATIONAL LEASE AN AIRCRAFT LEASING COMPANY SAID IT WILL USE PROCEEDS FOR GENERAL PURPOSES TO ACQUIRE AIRCRAFT AND TO RETIRE SHORT TERM DEBT
4bec020i THE COMPANY IS BASED IN BEVERLY HILLS CALIFORNIA
4bec020j THE ALTERED MEMO HOWEVER NEVER MENTIONED THE PRESIDENT
4bec020k INSTEAD IT RECOMMENDED ONLY THAT THE CURRENT DONORS BE APPROACHED TO PROVIDE FIFTEEN TO TWENTY MILLION ADDITIONAL
4bec020l AT THE TIME SAUDI ARABIA ALREADY HAD CONTRIBUTED THIRTY TWO MILLION TO THE CONTRAS
4bec020m SOME BANKS HAVE ALREADY TURNED CERTAIN DEBTS INTO SECURITIES WHICH SO FAR THEY HAVE HELD RATHER THAN SELLING
4bec020n TO GET AROUND JAPANESE GOVERNMENT LIMITS ON DEBT RESERVES A GROUP OF JAPANESE BANKS TURNED SOME THIRD WORLD DEBT INTO PREFERRED STOCK EARLIER THIS YEAR
4bec020o AND SHEARSON IS ABOUT TO START MARKETING A MUTUAL FUND TO BANKS THAT WOULD ALLOW THE BANKS TO SWAP PHILIPPINE DEBT FOR EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN THAT COUNTRY
4bec020p AROUND THAT TIME MR. GENGER ALSO MET WITH MR. EL SAYED
4bec020q HE SURFACED TO MEET WITH GENGER AFTER GENGER HAD MADE THE APPROACH TO THE COMPANY SAID MR. TROTMAN THE DREXEL BURNHAM BANKER
4bec020r I THINK HE WAS TRYING TO FIND A WAY BACK IN
4bec020s BUT MR. TROTMAN SAID MR. EL SAYED ISN'T INVOLVED IN THE TRANS RESOURCES BID
4bec020t <NOISE> BUT WESTIN HAS SHOWN UNSPECTACULAR ALBEIT STEADY EARNINGS IN RECENT YEARS AS COMPETITION HAS HEATED UP IN THE LUXURY HOTEL MARKET
4bec020u IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX IT HAD OPERATING EARNINGS OF FIFTY FIVE MILLION ABOUT FOUR MILLION LESS THAN IT EARNED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO
4bec020v REVENUE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX WAS FOUR NINE ONE POINT SIX MILLION
4bec020w CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN INHERITED FROM HIS PREDECESSOR PAUL VOLCKER A MONETARY POLICY THAT HAD BEEN QUITE ERRATIC
4bec020x THE FED ALLOWED THE MONEY SUPPLY TO GROW VERY RAPIDLY THROUGH NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
4bec020y THEN IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN THE CENTRAL BANK TIGHTENED UP SHARPLY
4bec020z FOR THE FIRST FEW MONTHS OF THIS YEAR I THOUGHT POLICY MIGHT BE ALL RIGHT SAYS MILTON FRIEDMAN OF THE HOOVER INSTITUTION
4bec0210 YOU COULD SAY THAT IT WAS OFFSETTING THE *EXCESSIVELY* EASY POLICY OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
4bec0211 BUT THE RESTRAINT CONTINUED AND IN EARLY OCTOBER BEFORE THE MARKET CRASH MR. FRIEDMAN PREDICTED A RECESSION WOULD START IN SIX TO NINE MONTHS
4bec0212 THE CLINCHER CRITICS SAY IS THE COMPARISON WITH FORDS BUILT AFTER NINETEEN EIGHTY
4bec0213 FOR THEM THE DEATH COUNT IS DOWN AS MUCH AS FIVEFOLD AND MORE LIKE OTHER CARS'
4bec0214 FOR NINETEEN EIGHTY AND LATER YEARS FORD REDESIGNED CERTAIN TRANSMISSION PARTS

4bec0216 REFLECTING THE STRENGTH OF THE POUND BRITISH BOND FUNDS PERFORMED BEST AS A GROUP WITH A SEVEN POINT ONE PERCENT MEDIAN RETURN
4bec0217 FUNDS HEAVILY INVESTED IN U. S. AND SWISS BONDS YIELDED THE QUARTER'S POOREST RETURNS
4bec0218 BUT THE RIDE COULD BE BUMPY
4bec0219 SOUTH KOREAN POLITICAL UNREST COULD CURB MARKET GAINS FOR ONE THING
4bec021a ANY SEVERE SLUMP IN U. S. MARKET COULD DRAG DOWN THE KOREA FUND TOO
4bec021b CURRENCY LOSSES ALSO COULD EAT INTO RETURNS THOUGH *ECONOMISTS* EXPECT THE SOUTH KOREAN WON WILL RISE IN VALUE AGAINST THE U. S. DOLLAR
4bec021c AND BUYING A FUND FOR MORE THAN ITS PORTFOLIO VALUE CAN BE TREACHEROUS SOME ANALYSTS SAY
4bec021d TRITON LOOKS LIKE A LOVELY BOSTON SNOW A FEW DAYS AFTER A SNOWSTORM MARVELS MR. JOHNSON THE BUSY HEAD OF THE IMAGING TEAM'S TRITON GROUP
4bec021e YOU SEE PILES OF WHITE SNOW AND PATCHES WHERE THE DIRT S:HOWS THROUGH
4bec021f MAYBE TRITON IS MORE LIKE A HUGE COMET THAN A MODEL FOR EARLY EARTH HE SPECULATES
4bec0301 DILLARD DEPARTMENT STORES INCORPORATED IS OFFERING FIFTY MILLION OF TWELVE YEAR EIGHT PERCENT NOTES PRICED AT NINETY NINE AND A QUARTER
4bec0302 SEPARATELY ITS DILLARD INVESTMENT COMPANY UNIT IS OFFERING FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OF TWELVE YEAR SEVEN AND THREE EIGHTHS PERCENT NOTES PRICED AT PAR
4bec0303 BOTH NOTES ISSUES WILL PAY *ACCRUED* INTEREST FROM LAST THURSDAY
4bec0304 BOTH OFFERINGS ARE BEING UNDERWRITTEN BY GOLDMAN SACHS AND COMPANY AND AREN'T REDEEMABLE BEFORE MATURITY
4bec0305 THE LITTLE ROCK ARKANSAS BASED RETAILER SAID IT WILL USE PROCEEDS TO RETIRE DEBT TO FINANCE OPERATIONS AND FOR OTHER GENERAL PURPOSES
4bec0306 THE INVESTMENT UNIT SAID IT WILL USE PROCEEDS TO BUY CONSUMER ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE GROWING OUT OF THE PARENT RETAIL SALES
4bec0307 PROCEEDS MAY ALSO BE USED TO RETIRE SHORT TERM BORROWINGS THE UNIT SAID
4bec0308 EVEN WHEN COMPLAINTS ARE FILED THEY CAN BE DIFFICULT TO VERIFY
4bec0309 AGENCIES GENERALLY DON'T USE UNDERCOVER TESTERS POSING AS PROSPECTIVE TENANTS AS THEY DO IN RACE DISCRIMINATION COMPLAINTS THEY FEAR THAT THE TESTERS COULD BE ATTACKED
4bec030a INSTEAD THEY TRY TO BUILD CASES ON THE TESTIMONY OF CURRENT AND FORMER TENANTS
4bec030b DEMOCRATS HAVE THE CREDIBILITY ON THE BUDGET ISSUE ASSERTS KIRK O'DONNELL PRESIDENT OF THE CENTER FOR NATIONAL POLICY A DEMOCRATIC THINK TANK
4bec030c NOW THEY HAVE TO MAKE THE RECORD
4bec030d FAILURE TO COME THROUGH WITH A DEFICIT CUTTING PLAN HE ADDS WOULD MEAN AN OPPORTUNITY LOST
4bec030e IT IS A MISSION THAT REMAINS RELEVANT IN THE POST SEGREGATION ERA
4bec030f MANY CURRENT MOREHOUSE STUDENTS WERE OFFERED SCHOLARSHIPS BY PREDOMINANTLY WHITE SCHOOLS BUT CAME HERE INSTEAD
4bec030g FOR EXAMPLE ARCHIE RICH A DETROIT *PAROCHIAL* SCHOOL GRADUATE TURNED DOWN A D- DIVING SCHOLARSHIP FROM MICHIGAN'S OAKLAND UNIVERSITY IN FAVOR OF MOREHOUSE
4bec030h I'VE ALWAYS FELT A STRONG RESPONSIBILITY TO THE BLACK COMMUNITY HE SAYS
4bec030i DESPITE THE DECLINE IN STOCK PRICES TRADING VOLUME WASN'T OVERWHELMING

4bec030z WE'RE NOT CHANGING BECAUSE OF ANY SALES SITUATION
4bec0310 MR. MIGNANELLI MEANWHILE SAYS HE'S BACKING CHIAT A HUNDRED PERCENT AND BELIEVES THAT MORE PEOPLE NOW RECOGNIZE THE NISSAN NAME
4bec0311 CONGRESS ALSO NEEDS TO TAKE STEPS TO IMPROVE ITS OWN ABILITY TO PROTECT SECRETS
4bec0312 CURRENT PROCEDURES ALMOST REQUIRE AN OPERATION'S COVER TO BE BLOWN BEFORE THE OPERATION CAN BE DISCUSSED OUTSIDE OF COMMITTEE
4bec0313 IF CONGRESS HAD *ADEQUATE* SECURITY LAWS AND PROCEDURES WITH STIFF PENALTIES FOR VIOLATIONS THE END RESULT PROBABLY WOULD BE MORE FRANK DISCUSSION NOT LESS
4bec0314 BUT THE PROPOSAL BY TEXACO'S LARGEST SHAREHOLDERS WHICH COULD LEAD TO HISTORY'S LARGEST ACQUISITION INVOLVES NUMEROUS CONTINGENCIES
4bec0315 FIRST MR. ICAHN SAID TEXACO WILL HAVE TO AGREE TO SUBMIT THE BID TO SHAREHOLDERS FOR APPROVAL
4bec0316 I'M GIVING THEM FORTY EIGHT HOURS HE SAID
4bec0317 THE SCHOOL HAS *VACILLATED* WITH ITS SMOKING POLICY
4bec0318 LAST YEAR IT ALLOWED SMOKING ALONE AND IN SILENCE
4bec0319 BUT AS STUDENTS KNOW CIGARETTES KILL

4bec031b MR. JACOBS DESCRIBED THE CURRENT EIGHT PERCENT INFLATION RATE AS HIGHER THAN DESIRABLE
4bec031c HE ALSO SAID IT WAS MIGHT ACCELERATE FURTHER OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS BEFORE LEVELING OFF
4bec031d BUT THE FINANCIAL SECRETARY SAID HE HOPED THAT PRICE INCREASES LIKE THE LABOR SHORTAGE WOULD EASE IF THE LOCAL ECONOMY SLOWS AS HE HAS PREDICTED
4bec0401 TO MANY OBSERVERS THE SITE WILL BE A BONANZA FOR WHOEVER DEVELOPS IT
4bec0402 IT IS ONE OF THE FINEST PIECES OF LAND THAT YOU CAN FIND SAYS SANFORD GOODKIN A MARINA DEL REY CALIFORNIA HOUSING CONSULTANT

4bec0406 BOESKY OR STEINBERG RECEIVE INSIDE INFORMATION ABOUT THE SECRET MERGER TALKS
4bec0407 DID THEIR LARGE POTENTIALLY UNFRIENDLY POSITIONS IN HARRIS ENCOURAGE HARRIS OFFICIALS TO COMPLETE A SALE
4bec0408 WERE THEY WORKING TOGETHER SEPARATELY OR IN CONCERT WITH DREXEL OFFICIALS TO BRING ABOUT A SALE OF HARRIS
4bec0409 IN ADDITION TO THE WAR OF NERVES OVER DISCOUNTS RETAIL EXECUTIVES SAID THIS CHRISTMAS SEASON HAS BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY THE ABSENCE OF A BIG HIT IN THE TOY DEPARTMENT
4bec040a BUT RETAILERS HAVE SEEN STRONG SALES OF BIG TICKET ITEMS TO WELL *HEELED* CUSTOMERS
4bec040b THEY ARE BUYING TO BEAT THE NEW TAX LAW WHICH WILL END THE DEDUCTION OF SALES TAXES AND SOME INTEREST EXPENSES
4bec040c THE LAW EVEN COMES WITH ITS OWN CATCH TWENTY TWO
4bec040d YOU'LL NEVER BE AGAIN BE ABLE TO FILL OUT YOUR OWN TAX RETURN ROGER TELLS ME

4bec0418 ANOTHER IS HEAVY INVESTMENT INFLOWS FROM JAPAN *AUSTRALIA* NEW ZEALAND CHINA AND TAIWAN
4bec0419 BUT THE RELIANCE ALSO RAISES THE STAKES IN THE FARMERS RACE
4bec041a THE WHOLE GROUP STRATEGY GOES OUT THE DOOR IF B. A. T. LOSES FARMERS SAYS PAUL BURKE AN ANALYST AT LONDON *STOCKBROKERS* KLEINWORT *GRIEVESON* SECURITIES
4bec041b AND YOU'RE PERCEIVED AS A LOSER WHICH YOU DON'T WANT TO BE IN AMERICA
4bec041c IN THE CURRENT DEBATE MR. *BUSH* IS USING A. C. L. U. TO PIN A LIBERAL LABEL ON THE DEMOCRATIC CHALLENGER
4bec041d BUT THE A. C. L. U. HAS RELIED THROUGHOUT MUCH OF ITS HISTORY ON REPUBLICAN SUPPORT AND HAS ALLIED ITSELF WITH REPUBLICANS ON NUMEROUS ISSUES
4bec041e IN THE CURRENT CONTROVERSY SOME *REPUBLI-* -(RE)!PUBLICANS ARE TRYING TO MINIMIZE THEIR PAST INVOLVEMENT
4bec041f NOBODY KNOWS I HAVE THIS DI- DISEASE MR. PARR CONFIDED
4bec041g I'VE GOT FOURTEEN PEOPLE WORKING FOR ME AND IF THEY FIND OUT THEY'LL LEAVE ME
4bec041h I COULD NEVER TELL THEM
4bfc0201 OCTOBER'S CONTRACTING FOR TRANSPORTATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONSTRUCTION SURGED THIRTY SEVEN PERCENT TO AN ANNUAL RATE OF FORTY FOUR POINT THREE NINE BILLION FOLLOWING A SHARP DECLINE IN SEPTEMBER
4bfc0202 THE RALLY IN PUBLIC WORKS CONSTRUCTION DOMINATED THE MONTH'S ACTIVITY
4bfc0203 MODEST GAINS IN HOME BUILDING WERE OFFSET BY A DECLINE IN NONRESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION
4bfc0204 THE NEW SERVICE DIFFERS FROM THE SHUTTLE IN SEVERAL WAYS
4bfc0205 IT WON'T HAVE THE BACKUP PLANES THAT THE SHUTTLE USES TO ACCOMMODATE PASSENGER OVERFLOW
4bfc0206 THE NEW FLIGHTS WILL INCLUDE ADVANCE SEAT SELECTION AND FIRST CLASS AND COACH SERVICE WHICH THE SHUTTLE DOESN'T
4bfc0207 SHUTTLE FLIGHTS DEPART ON THE HOUR THE NEW SERVICE WILL OPERATE ON THE HALF HOUR
4bfc0208 KIDDER PEABODY FOUNDED FOUR YEARS EARLIER LONG HAS BEEN A SOCIALLY WELL CONNECTED AND PROFITABLE INVESTMENT BANK
4bfc0209 BUT ITS POWER ON WALL STREET EBBED IN RECENT YEARS AS IT WAS OVERTAKEN BY LARGER MORE AGGRESSIVE FIRMS
4bfc020a KIDDER OFFICIALS HAVE RECENTLY HOPED THAT ITS LINK WITH GENERAL ELECTRIC AND G. E.'S LARGE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL WOULD RESTORE IT TO ITS EARLIER PREEMINENCE
4bfc020b <NOISE> MR. CASH OF HARVARD ADDS THERE IS A SHORTSIGHTEDNESS ON THE PART OF THE SUPPLIERS

4bfc020e HERE ARE PRICE TRENDS ON THE WORLD'S MAJOR STOCK MARKETS AS CALCULATED BY MORGAN STANLEY CAPITAL INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE IN GENEVA
4bfc020f TO MAKE THEM DIRECTLY COMPARABLE EACH INDEX IS BASED ON THE CLOSE OF NINETEEN SIXTY NINE EQUALING ONE HUNDRED
4bfc020g THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE IS SINCE YEAR END
4bfc020h <NOISE> MERRILL LYNCH CANADA INCORPORATED WILL BE GLOBAL MANAGER FOR THE OFFERING AND WILL LEAD CANADIAN UNDERWRITERS
4bfc020i THE U. S. SYNDICATE WILL BE LED BY MERRILL LYNCH AND COMPANY AND GOLDMAN SACHS AND COMPANY
4bfc020j AN INTERNATIONAL UNIT OF MERRILL LYNCH WILL LEAD THE INTERNATIONAL SYNDICATE
4bfc020k BECAUSE OF THAT SOME WALL STREET PROFESSIONALS THINK THE STOCK LOOKS RATHER EXPENSIVE
4bfc020l IT HAS TRIPLED SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE LARGELY ON TAKEOVER SPECULATION
4bfc020m IT CURRENTLY TRADES AT ABOUT NINE TIMES CASH FLOW SAYS ALAN GAINES OF GAINES BERLAND AN INSTITUTIONAL BROKERAGE FIRM
4bfc020n THAT'S ABOUT A THIRTY PERCENT PREMIUM TO QUALITY OIL COMPANIES LIKE ROYAL DUTCH PETROLEUM EXXON AND MOBIL HE SAYS
4bfc020o <NOISE> IN TAMPA A JIM WALTER SPOKESMAN WOULDN'T DISCUSS THE MATTER
4bfc020p PEOPLE CAN SAY WHAT THEY WANT BUT WE WON'T COMMENT HE SAID
4bfc020q MR. WALTER HIMSELF AND OTHER TOP EXECUTIVES DIDN'T RETURN PHONE CALLS
4bfc020r FOR A SHIP OR MISSILE GUIDED BY THE WRONG TIME SIGNAL THAT LITTLE GAP COULD MEAN ARRIVING AT THE WRONG DESTINATION
4bfc020s IF WE LET THE DIFFERENCE GROW SAYS MR. MCCARTHY WE COULD RUN INTO PROBLEMS OVER THOUSANDS OF YEARS
4bfc020t IT MIGHT BE NOON BY ATOMIC TIME BUT DARK OUTSIDE
4bfc020u THE FINANCIAL TIMES THIRTY SHARE INDEX CLOSED SEVEN POINT ONE POINTS LOWER AT ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN POINT FOUR THE DAY'S BEST LEVEL

4bfc020z IN THIS CASE THE J. C. S. CHIEF FEARED THAT CONGRESS MIGHT CURTAIL THE NAVY OPERATION IF THE U. S. REPEATEDLY LOOKED ILL PREPARED
4bfc0210 I HAD REALLY UNDERESTIMATED HOW INVOLVED CONGRESS WOULD GET AND HOW DETERMINED THEY WOULD BE TO POLITICIZE IT HE SAYS
4bfc0211 NEW CAMPAIGN CO CHAIRMAN LAXALT MAY SERVE AS INTERMEDIARY WITH THE REAGANS EVEN AFTER EIGHT YEARS BUSH STILL FEELS AWKWARD TALKING TO THEM
4bfc0212 SOME STRATEGISTS THINK REAGAN'S RECENT RASH OF PATENTLY PARTISAN MOVES HAS BEEN A MISTAKE
4bfc0213 ONE EXPLANATION THE DESIRE OF CHIEF OF STAFF DUBERSTEIN EARLIER VIEWED AS A DOLE SUPPORTER TO INGRATIATE HIMSELF WITH BUSH
4bfc0214 THERE ARE TOO MANY CASES WHERE CUSTOMS OFFICERS HAVE GIVEN THEIR OPINION THE CLASSIFICATION OF GOODS OFF THE TOP OF THEIR HEADS
4bfc0215 THIS IS THE FAULT OF THE SERVICE
4bfc0216 BUT IT IS ALSO THE FAULT OF BUSINESSES THAT RELY ON THIS SORT OF INFORMAL ADVICE
4bfc0217 WE LOVE THESE HORSES HE SAYS
4bfc0218 WE HAVE A RECESSION BUT MANY PEOPLE ARE RICH
4bfc0219 IF YOU HAVE A HOUSE AND PICTURES YOU WANT A HORSE AN ARABIAN HORSE
4bfc021a EXACTLY LIKE AMERICA

4bfc0302 IT BOUGHT BROOKS IN SEPTEMBER FOR NINETY FIVE MILLION A BIT LESS THAN BOOK VALUE AND TOOK ON ITS DEBT OF SIXTY SEVEN MILLION
4bfc0303 THE PAYMENT CONSISTED MOSTLY OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES APPARENTLY BOUGHT WITH THE PROCEEDS OF THE DREXEL FINANCING AND A PROMISSORY NOTE
4bfc0304 BROOKS ITSELF BORROWED MONEY TO FUND THE THIRTY MILLION CASH PORTION
4bfc0305 BUT WHILE EUREKA PROJECTS ARE MORE EASILY APPROVED THE VAGUENESS OF THE FUNDING IS ONE REASON MANY EUROPEAN COMPANIES HAVE BEEN SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE PROGRAM'S VALUE
4bfc0306 ANOTHER IS ITS LOOSE ORGANIZATION WITH NO CENTRAL SYSTEM YET ESTABLISHED FOR CHECKING ON THE PROGRESS OF INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS
4bfc0307 MOST OF THE PROJECTS ADOPTED OVER THE PAST YEAR HAVEN'T GOTTEN OFF THE DRAWING BOARD
4bfc0308 BALLY'S DRIVE INTO THE HOTEL CASINO INDUSTRY HAS MADE HEALTH CLUBS AN INC:REASINGLY AWKWARD FIT ANALYSTS SAID AND THUS THE MOST LIKELY CANDIDATE FOR DIVESTITURE
4bfc0309 BY SHEDDING THE HEALTH CLUB LINE BALLY COULD FOCUS ON ITS REMAINING OPERATIONS GAMBLING MACHINES STATE LOTTERIES AND AMUSEMENT CENTERS
4bfc030a ANALYSTS ALSO QUESTION THE FIT OF THE COMPANY'S THEME PARKS THOUGH SAYING A SALE OF THAT OPERATION COULD FOLLOW
4bfc030b SOME WERE QUITE VEHEMENT IN RESISTING ANY CHANGE

4bfc030e S. D. I. PERPETUATES THE ILLUSION THAT MORE WEAPONS EQUALS MORE SECURITY
4bfc030f OUR DEPENDENCE UPON VIOLENCE TO RESOLVE CONFLICT IS A SHORT RUN SOLUTION TO A LONG TERM PROBLEM
4bfc030g IN ORDER TO ENSURE OUR SURVIVAL WE MUST CHANGE THE WAY WE THINK ABOUT CONFLICT
4bfc030h BY SPENDING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OR DEVELOPING NONVIOLENT MEANS OF RESOLVING CONFLICT WE CAN BUILD A WORLD BEYOND WAR AND A SUSTAINABLE SECURE FUTURE FOR ALL PEOPLE

4bfc030v <NOISE> NEVERTHELESS SOME ANALYSTS SAY THE FED ALREADY MAY BE TIGHTENING CREDIT SLIGHTLY
4bfc030w THEY POINT TO RECENT INCREASES IN THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE WHICH IS THE RATE ON RESERVES THAT BANKS LEND EACH OTHER OVERNIGHT
4bfc030x THE FUNDS RATE AVERAGED ABOUT SEVEN AND FIVE EIGHTHS PERCENT YESTERDAY AND TUESDAY UP FROM AN AVERAGE OF SEVEN POINT FOUR THREE PERCENT IN THE WEEK ENDED OCTOBER SEVENTH
4bfc030y THESE ANALYSTS ARGUE THAT THE INCREASE WAS ENGINEERED BY THE FED

4bfc0310 <NOISE> IF THE PRESIDENT SIGNS OFF ON SIGNIFICANT TAXES THERE'LL BE A LOT OF SCREAMING AND SHOUTING SAYS A WHITE HOUSE AIDE
4bfc0311 BUT DESPITE THE RHETORIC ANY TAX BILL ACCEPTED BY THE WHITE HOUSE IS LIKELY TO DO LITTLE TO REDUCE THE RED INK
4bfc0312 <NOISE> SEVERAL NEW TAXES PROPOSED BY THE HOUSE ON TAKEOVERS ALSO APPEAR DOOMED
4bfc0313 BUT OTHERS NOTABLY WELLS FARGO INVESTMENT ADVISERS PRESSED ON
4bfc0314 WE FELT THAT THE FUTURES MARKET REFLECTED ACTUAL TRADING LEVELS AT THE TIME SAYS FRED GRAUER THE HEAD OF THE WELLS FARGO AND COMPANY SUBSIDIARY
4bfc0315 MANY STOCK PRICES HADN'T BEEN UPDATED IN SEVERAL MINUTES HE EXPLAINS AND IT WAS LIKELY THAT SUBSEQUENT STOCK TRADES WOULD BE AT EVEN LOWER LEVELS
4bfc0316 BY DAY'S END WELLS SOLD FOURTEEN THOUSAND FUTURE CONTRACTS AMOUNTING TO NEARLY TWO BILLION DOLLARS
4bfc0317 <NOISE> THE GUIDE LOOKS DOWN AND PULLS AT HIS SOCKS
4bfc0318 LATER HE SAYS WHEN THE RUSSIANS LIBERATED SMOLENSK A NEW COMMISSION FOUND GERMAN BULLETS IN THE SKULLS OF THE OFFICERS
4bfc0319 AND THE METHOD BY WHICH THEY WHERE SHOT IN THE BACKS OF THE HEADS WAS A GERMAN METHOD
4bfc031a AND THEY FOUND GERMAN WEAPONS
4bfc031b THAT IS WHY THE RUSSIANS SAID IT WAS DONE BY THE NAZIS IN NINETEEN FORTY ONE
4bfc031c AND THAT IS EVERYTHING I KNOW
4bfc0401 STAN WEINSTEIN THE EDITOR OF THE PROFESSIONAL TAPE READER WHICH ALSO RANKED NEAR THE BOTTOM IN THE SURVEY DISAGREES WITH SEVERAL ASSUMPTIONS IN MR. HULBERT'S RANKING METHOD
4bfc0402 FOR EXAMPLE MR. WEINSTEIN DISLIKES THE WAY MR. HULBERT CALCULATES ENTRY AND EXIT PRICES
4bfc0403 HE SAYS MR. HULBERT SHOULD USE PRICES MIDWAY IN MR. WEINSTEIN'S RECOMMENDED RANGES FOR STOCK PURCHASES OR SALES
4bfc0404 MR. HULBERT CUSTOMARILY USES MARKET PRICES EITHER THE OPENING PRICE OR THE AVERAGE PRICE FOR THE DAY SHORTLY AFTER THE RECOMMENDATION WAS MADE
4bfc0405 IT IS A MISSION THAT REMAINS RELEVANT IN THE POST SEGREGATION ERA
4bfc0406 <NOISE> MANY CURRENT MOREHOUSE STUDENTS WERE OFFERED SCHOLARSHIPS BY PREDOMINANTLY WHITE SCHOOLS BUT CAME HERE INSTEAD
4bfc0407 FOR EXAMPLE ARCHIE RICH A DETROIT PAROCHIAL SCHOOL GRADUATE TURNED DOWN A DIVING SCHOLARSHIP FROM MICHIGAN'S OAKLAND UNIVERSITY IN FAVOR OF MOREHOUSE
4bfc0408 I'VE ALWAYS FELT A STRONG RESPONSIBILITY TO THE BLACK COMMUNITY HE SAYS
4bfc0409 MOREOVER A WESTERN FIRM HAS TO MAKE SOME CALCULATION OF WHETHER MR. GORBACHEV WILL SUCCEED IN HIS EFFORTS TO ACTIVATE THE SOVIET WORK FORCE
4bfc040a PAST EXPERIENCE AND CURRENT REPORTS INDICATE THAT HIS CHANCES AREN'T GOOD

4bfc040f U. S. BANKS IN JAPAN CURRENTLY CAN TRADE IN SOME SECURITIES BUT ARE BASICALLY CONFINED TO DEALING WITH THE HUNDRED AND TWENTY LARGEST JAPANESE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
4bfc040g THEY CAN'T DEAL WITH EITHER RETAIL CUSTOMERS OR CORPORATIONS
4bfc040h THEY CAN UNDERWRITE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT BONDS BUT THE SHARE OF SUCH BUSINESS REMAINS VERY SMALL
4bfc040i A MAN WHO DOES THIS THE CONGRESSMAN PROFESSES TO BELIEVE CAN'T BE TRUSTED
4bfc040j <NOISE> CERTAINLY HE CAN'T ASSOCIATE WITH THE BOY SCOUTS WHO INHABIT CAPITOL HILL HEARING ROOMS
4bfc040k OFF WITH HIS HEAD
4bfc040l A RECENT VOTING STUDY BY THE COMPETITIVE ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE TRIES TO MEASURE WHAT CONGRESSMEN ACTUALLY DO TO LOWER COMPETITIVE BARRIERS AND END CORPORATE SUBSIDIES <NOISE> NOT WHAT THEY SAY
4bfc040m IN THE LAST SESSION OF CONGRESS THE AVERAGE HOUSE MEMBER VOTED WITH C. E. I. ONLY FORTY PERCENT OF THE TIME

4bfc040p WHATEVER WE THINK ABOUT THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT IN IRAN IT IS AMONG THE PLANET'S MOST VITAL TERRITORIES
4bfc040q OUR SHARED ENEMY HAS FIVE DIVISIONS ON IRAN'S NORTHERN BORDER
4bfc040r <NOISE> THIS LOOMING SOVIET PRESENCE THREATENS NOT JUST AFGHANISTAN SOUTH OF THE SOVIET UNION AND EAST OF IRAN <NOISE> BUT THE PERSIAN GULF
4bfc040s THE WARM WATER PORT THE CZARS DREAMED OF IS WITHIN REACH
4bfc040t WE WILL HAVE A LOT MORE THAN SOME KUWAITI TANKERS TO WORRY ABOUT IF THE SOVIETS GET THEIR PAWS ON THE OIL SPIGOT TO WESTERN EUROPE AND JAPAN

4bfc040v JOHN JENNINGS VICE PRESIDENT OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS' ASSOCIATION SAID DOCTOR PECK MAY HAVE TWO SCIENTISTS BELOW HIM HANDLING DRUG REVIEW

4bfc0410 A CONTROL GROUP IN THE STUDY WILL RECEIVE A SMALLPOX VACCINE
4bfc0411 BUT EXXON CORPORATION AMOCO CORPORATION AND ATLANTIC RICHFIELD COMPANY POSTED HIGHER PROFIT
4bfc0412 NEW YORK BASED EXXON THE NATION'S BIGGEST OIL COMPANY HAD THE SMALLEST PERCENTAGE INCREASE
4bfc0413 ITS NET INCOME CLIMBED FIVE POINT ONE PERCENT EVEN THOUGH GAINS FROM ASSET SALES CONTRIBUTED THIRTY FOUR CENTS A SHARE TO YEAR EARLIER PROFIT
4bfc0414 PATTEN RETAINS LAND SPECIALISTS WHO KNOW THE REGULATORY ROPES AND HOW TO GET SUBDIVISIONS APPROVED

4bfc0419 BUT BURNUP AND SIMS MANAGEMENT WANTED NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM AND AT ONE POINT EIGHTEEN TOP BURNUP AND SIMS QUIT IN PROTEST
4bfc041a BY NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO THE COMPANIES WERE EXCHANGING SUITS THAT HAVE LINGERED IN THE COURTS EVER SINCE
4bfc041b MERITOR ALSO JOINED THE FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK SYSTEM LAST MONTH
4bfc041c IT CAN BORROW INTERMEDIATE TERM FUNDS FROM THE BANK SYSTEM WHICH WOULD ALLOW MERITOR *TO* MORE CLOSELY MATCH ITS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
4bfc041d ITS DEPOSITS ARE STILL INSURED BY THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION
4bfc041e WHEN THE FEDERAL RESERVE EARLIER THIS MONTH RAISED THE DISCOUNT RATE IT DIDN'T INCREASE ITS POPULARITY
4bfc041f G. O. P. POLITICIANS PUBLICLY DAMNED THE MOVE WITH FAINT PRAISE AND PRIVATELY WORRIED THAT THE FED WAS CREATING A RECESSION THAT WOULD WIPE OUT GEORGE BUSH
4bfc041g DEMOCRAT MICHAEL DUKAKIS WAS A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE BUT ALLOWED AS HOW HE COULD SEE THE NEED FOR THE MOVE
4bgc0201 BUT WHILE EUREKA PROJECTS ARE MORE EASILY APPROVED THE VAGUENESS OF THEIR FUNDING IS ONE REASON WHY MANY EUROPEAN COMPANIES HAVE BEEN SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE PROGRAM'S VALUE
4bgc0202 ANOTHER IS ITS LOOSE ORGANIZATION WITH NO CENTRAL SYSTEM YET ESTABLISHED FOR CHECKING ON THE PROGRESS OF INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS
4bgc0203 MOST OF THE PROJECTS ADOPTED OVER THE PAST YEAR HAVEN'T GOTTEN OFF THE DRAWING BOARD
4bgc0204 ONE PROBLEM WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE UNPOPULAR NEW W. FOUR FORM IS THAT THE I. R. S. FAILED TO TEST IT ADEQUATELY
4bgc0205 IN FACT THE FORM WASN'T SHOWN TO THE PUBLIC AT ALL
4bgc0206 IT WAS PRESENTED ONLY TO I. R. S. EMPLOYEES IN TWO OF THE AGENCY'S SERVICE CENTERS
4bgc0207 OFFICIALS SUGGEST THAT THESE CLERICAL NON TECHNICAL WORKERS REALLY AREN'T MUCH DIFFERENT FROM THE GENERAL PUBLIC

4bgc020n THEY HAD SAID HOWEVER THAT THEY WOULD FAVOR AN ACQUISITION UPON TERMS WHICH WERE INDEPENDENTLY APPRAISED AS FAIR BY ALL SHAREHOLDERS

4bgc0215 THE TURKS WERE NEARBY BUT THEY ALSO HAD INFERIOR MULES
4bgc0216 THE CHINESE CHARGED OUTLANDISH RATES FULLY TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A MULE
4bgc0217 THE EGYPTIANS WERE QUICKLY DRAINED OF THEIR SUPPLY
4bgc0218 THE U. S. WAS THE REBELS' LAST BEST HOPE

4bgc030t I APPLAUD THE ATTEMPTS AT TRYING TO GET SOME JOINT ACTION
4bgc030u IT'S A MILESTONE IN THAT REGARD
4bgc030v BUT MR. PARCHER IS ALSO CONSIDERED ABRASIVE AT TIMES
4bgc030w HE RUBS SOME PEOPLE WRONG SAYS LEONARD MARKS WHO HAS TRIED CASES AGAINST HIM
4bgc030x HE'S VERY OUTSPOKEN
4bgc030y IT DOES NOT HOWEVER SEEM REASONABLE TO THE GERMANS WHO ARE INSTEAD MULLING A TAX INCREASE TO SHORE UP A LEAKY GOVERNMENT BUDGET
4bgc030z AS FOR THE U. S. COMMENTS ON GERMAN INFLATION A TYPICAL GERMAN MIGHT RESPOND ZERO INFLATION
4bgc0310 WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT
4bgc0311 THE STUDY WAS PART OF CORNELL'S RESPONSE TO CALLS BY LOCAL POLITICIANS THAT IT SHOULD HELP MORE IN TOMPKINS COUNTY
4bgc0312 WHEN THE SCHOOLS WERE RANKED BY OPERATING BUDGET OR VALUE OF BUILDINGS CORNELL'S ONE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLAR PAYMENTS WERE FOUND TO BE NEAR THE BOTTOM OF THE LIST
4bgc0313 IN PER STUDENT PAYMENTS CORNELL RANKED SEVENTH AT SEVENTY DOLLARS
4bgc0314 BUT FREEDOM ISN'T AN ACCIDENT
4bgc0315 IT IS THE RESULT OF PAINSTAKING WORK TO MAINTAIN THE STRUCTURE OF LIBERTY AGAINST INEVITABLE EROSION AT THE HANDS OF THE GOVERNMENT
4bgc0316 <NOISE> I THOUGHT THAT MY WORK FOR THE A. C. L. U. WAS AN INTEGRAL PART OF MAINTAINING FREEDOM FOR EVERYONE
4bgc0317 I NOW CONFESS MY ERROR AND EMBRACE LEADER BUSH'S PERCEPTION THAT THE A. C. L. U. IS A POLITICALLY SUSPECT LIBERAL CONSPIRACY
4bgc0318 IN MY MINISTRY WE HAVE DISCUSSED THE ALTERNATIVES OF INDEPENDENCE
4bgc0319 THERE ARE ALREADY TWO GERMANYS AND TWO KOREAS
4bgc031a BUT AFTER CLOSE STUDY WE CONCLUDED THAT INDEPENDENCE IS A DEAD END
4bgc031b WHO WOULD RECOGNIZE US
4bgc031c AND IN THAT CASE WHAT'S THE USE OF DECLARING INDEPENDENCE
4bgc031d THEN IN JUNE CAME A CASE INVOLVING COLLEGE STUDENTS WHO ATTEMPTED TO THROW A TUPPERWARE PARTY AT THE STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK
4bgc031e THEY WERE FORBIDDEN BY UNIVERSITY OFFICIALS WHO CITED RULES PROHIBITING COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISES ON CAMPUS
4bgc031f THE STUDENTS SUED THE SCHOOL BUT THE SUPREME COURT HELD IN FAVOR OF THE UNIVERSITY BAN
4bgc0401 THE BUNDESBANK HAS REFUSED ANY FURTHER ACTION
4bgc0402 THESE DAYS IT'S POSSIBLE TO PICK UP THE PAPERS AND READ ABOUT WEST GERMAN FEARS OF REIGNITING INFLATION
4bgc0403 YOU HAVE TO PINCH YOURSELF TO REMEMBER THAT THE INFLATION RUNNING NEAR ZERO IN APRIL IS NOW RUNNING BELOW ZERO
4bgc0404 THE E. M. S. APPARENTLY MUST NOW BE REALIGNED AND THE FRANC DEVALUED TO ACCOMMODATE THE GERMAN TASTE FOR DEFLATION
4bgc0405 THAT HARDLY MATTERS SAYS SIR GEOFFREY NOTING THAT WITH ALL THE TRAITOR SPIES THAT PRECEDED HIM THERE WASN'T MUCH LEFT TO TELL
4bgc0406 THE POINT IS HE WAS ONE OF US

4bgc040h THIS WAS THE CASE THAT UPHELD INDIANA'S LAW REGULATING CORPORATE TAKEOVERS WHICH WENT MUCH FURTHER THAN FEDERAL LAW TO PROTECT TARGETS AT THE EXPENSE OF BIDDERS
4bgc040i THE RESULT IS A CRUSH OF ANTI TAKEOVER LAWS IN A DOZEN STATES SO FAR
4bgc040j THE ADMINISTRATION OPPOSES THE BILL AND NO SIMILAR LEGISLATION HAS BEEN INTRODUCED IN THE SENATE
4bgc040k THE SENATE GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS COMMITTEE'S SUBCOMMITTEE ON CIVIL SERVICE WILL HOLD HEARINGS ON THE MEASURE LATE THIS YEAR OR EARLY IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT A SPOKESMAN SAID
4bgc040l CONGRESSIONAL SOURCES SAID THE LEGISLATION IS EXPECTED TO FACE GREATER OPPOSITION IN THE SENATE THAN IN THE HOUSE

4bgc040n THE COMPANY SAID NET PROCEEDS OF ABOUT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS WILL BE MAINLY USED TO FINANCE GOLD MINING ACQUISITIONS
4bgc040o NORTHGATE SAID IT WILL SEEK PURE GOLD MINES ONLY
4bgc040p OCEAN SPRAY SAYS IT SIMPLY CAN'T SELL PURE CRANBERRY JUICE BECAUSE IT'S TOO TART TASTING
4bgc040q SO WHY NOT EXPLAIN THAT FACT ON THE LABEL
4bgc040r CONSUMERS WOULD AUTOMATICALLY ASSUME OUR PRODUCT IS LESS NUTRITIOUS THAN PURE ORANGE OR APPLE JUICE A SPOKESMAN SAYS
4bgc040s BUT THAT ISN'T NECESSARILY SO
4bgc040t MACY IS OFFERING SEVENTY SEVEN DOLLARS AND THIRTY CENTS A SHARE FOR EIGHTY PERCENT OF FEDERATED'S SHARES PLUS STOCK IN A COMBINED FEDERATED MACY FOR THE REMAINDER
4bgc040u THE STOCK COMPONENT MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE THE VALUE OF THE TOTAL BID <NOISE> WHICH HAS BEEN WIDELY ESTIMATED AT ABOUT SIX POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS

4bgc0416 THE SEEDS OF NATWEST'S INVESTMENT BANKING PROBLEMS WERE SOWN MONTHS BEFORE THE DEREGULATION OF BRITAIN'S FINANCIAL MARKETS
4bgc0417 RIVALS SUCH AS BARCLAYS AND S. G. WARBURG GROUP P. L. C. ASSEMBLED POWERHOUSE CONGLOMERATES OF BROKERAGE TRADING AND FIXED INCOME SECURITIES FIRMS
4bgc0418 BUT NATWEST THEN PUSHING TO DISLODGE BARCLAYS AS BRITAIN'S TOP COMMERCIAL BANK WAS MORE RELUCTANT TO COMMIT ITSELF TO A SIMILAR POSITION IN INVESTMENT BANKING
4bgc0419 THE SUIT CHARGES THAT BURGER KING ONLY ALLOWS BLACK FRANCHISES TO EXPAND ONE STORE AT A TIME WHILE WHITES ARE ALLOWED TO SIMULTANEOUSLY OPEN MULTIPLE FRANCHISES
4bgc041a BURGER KING ALSO MAKES BLACKS WAIT THREE TO FOUR TIMES LONGER THAN WHITES FOR APPROVAL OF A NEW OR EXPANSION FRANCHISE THE SUIT SAYS
4bgc041b THE FRANCHISES FURTHER ALLEGE THAT BURGER KING FALSELY AND FRAUDULENTLY MISREPRESENTED THE SALES POTENTIAL OF THEIR STORES
4bgc041c MR. GREENSPAN COMPLIED
4bgc041d WHAT HAPPENED THERE IS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT I GATHER IS HAPPENING HERE HE SAID
4bgc041e JUST WHEN THE SOCIAL SECURITY PANEL WAS ABOUT TO GIVE UP THE DAM BROKE WHICH LED US TO A RATHER SURPRISING END

4bhc0202 BIG COMPANIES NOW ISSUE THEIR OWN PAPER
4bhc0203 THE OLD GLASS STEAGALL ARGUMENTS AIMED AT LIMITING RISK AND DANGERS THAT BIG BANKS WOULD END UP CONTROLLING INDUSTRY LOOK MORE AND MORE DATED
4bhc0204 INVESTMENT BANKS PROVIDE BILLIONS IN BRIDGE LOANS FOR CORPORATE RESTRUCTURINGS AND TAKEOVERS
4bhc0205 INVESTMENT BANKS SEEKING MORE CASH WILL BE ABLE TO TEAM UP WITH COMMERCIAL BANKS WITHOUT HAVING TO LOOK ABROAD AS GOLDMAN SACHS DID TO FIND JAPAN'S SUMITOMO BANK
4bhc0206 <NOISE> THAT LINE MAY BE WEARING THIN WITH PRIVATE BANKS
4bhc0207 THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE EVIDENCE OF SOUND POLICY MOVES
4bhc0208 OTHERWISE WHY KEEP POURING GOOD MONEY AFTER BAD
4bhc0209 <NOISE> IN THE FEBRUARY TWENTY SECOND ACCORD THE U. S. AND ITS ALLIES ASSERTED THAT THE DOLLAR HAD DECLINED ENOUGH
4bhc020a <NOISE> THEY PLEDGED TO INTERVENE JOINTLY IN THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKETS TO KEEP EXCHANGE RATES AT ABOUT THEIR CURRENT LEVELS
4bhc020b THE DOLLAR REMAINED STABLE FOR ABOUT FOUR WEEKS AFTER THE ACCORD WAS REACHED BUT THEN BEGAN TO SLUMP AGAINST THE JAPANESE YEN

4bhc020y <NOISE> I COME WITH VERY STRONG CONCEPTUAL SKILLS WITH VERY STRONG HISTORICAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION TO THE REGULATION OF THE SECURITIES MARKETS
4bhc020z RATES ARE DETERMINED BY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PURCHASE PRICE AND FACE VALUE
4bhc0210 THUS HIGHER BIDDING NARROWS THE INVESTOR'S RETURN WHILE LOWER BIDDING WIDENS IT
4bhc0211 THE PERCENTAGE RATES ARE CALCULATED ON A THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY DAY YEAR WHILE THE COUPON EQUIVALENT YIELD IS BASED ON A THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE DAY YEAR

4bic0213 A SIMILAR VIEW IS HELD BY GRETA E. MARSHALL INVESTMENT MANAGER OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC EMPLOYEES' RETIREMENT SYSTEM WHICH MANAGES ABOUT FORTY FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS
4bic0214 I STILL SEE NO EVIDENCE THAT INFLATION IS PICKING UP SUBSTANTIALLY SHE SAYS
4bic0215 THE ECONOMY DOESN'T LOOK SO STRONG THAT IT WILL REKINDLE INFLATION SO I WOULD VIEW ANY FURTHER DROP IN BOND PRICES AS A BUYING OPPORTUNITY

4bic0218 ALSO THE COMPANY CITED DEVELOPMENT COSTS FOR THREE NEW MAGAZINES
4bic0219 THAT FIGHT WHILE REMARKABLE FOR ITS BITTERNESS TYPIFIES THE CORE PROBLEM OF THE NATIONWIDE PUSH TO CONTAIN MEDICAL COSTS WHO GETS LESS

4bic021e ANALYSTS SAY THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF REASONS WHY THE I. P. O.S ON ONE MARKET MIGHT OUTPERFORM THOSE ON ANOTHER OVER A PARTICULAR PERIOD
4bic021f FOR ONE THING SMALLER STOCKS HAVE OUTPERFORMED LARGER ISSUES FOR MUCH OF THE SPAN COVERED IN N. A. S. D.'S STATISTICS

4bjc020b THE ALTERED MEMO HOWEVER NEVER MENTIONED THE PRESIDENT
4bjc020c INSTEAD IT RECOMMENDED ONLY THAT THE CURRENT DONORS BE APPROACHED TO PROVIDE FIFTEEN TO TWENTY MILLION ADDITIONAL DOLLARS
4bjc020d AT THE TIME SAUDI ARABIA ALREADY HAD CONTRIBUTED THIRTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS TO THE CONTRAS
4bjc020e MR. JUNGER PREVIOUSLY HAS DENIED ANY WRONGDOING AND HAS SAID THAT HE ISN'T RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CURRENCY LOSS

4bjc0305 IT REPORTED FIRST QUARTER PROFIT ROSE TO SEVENTY NINE CENTS A SHARE FROM TWENTY TWO CENTS A SHARE
4bjc0306 BUT THERE APPEAR TO BE SOME MAJOR CATCHES
4bjc0307 MANY BANKS THAT CUT RATES HAVE SMALL NUMBERS OF CARDS OUTSTANDING
4bjc0308 IN OTHER CASES LOWER RATES ARE AVAILABLE ONLY TO THE MOST CREDITWORTHY CUSTOMERS
4bjc0309 AND CERTAIN RATE REDUCTIONS ARE BEING OFFSET BY HIGHER ANNUAL FEES AND ELIMINATION OF INTEREST FREE GRACE PERIODS
