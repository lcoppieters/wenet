01gc0204 <NOISE> IN WATERLOO IOWA A FARM EQUIPMENT FACTORY TOWN HOME SELLERS ARE COMPETING WITH BANKS STRUGGLING TO UNLOAD HOMES THEY'VE REPOSSESSED
01gc0205 PRICES AROUND HERE ARE WHERE THEY WERE IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX TO NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT SAYS NANCY ERICKSON A REAL ESTATE AGENT
01gc0206 EVEN WHEN COMPLAINTS ARE FILED THEY CAN BE DIFFICULT TO VERIFY
01gc0207 AGENCIES GENERALLY DON'T USE UNDERCOVER TESTERS POSING AS PROSPECTIVE TENANTS AS THEY DO IN RACE DISCRIMINATION COMPLAINTS THEY FEAR THAT THE TESTER COULD BE ATTACKED
01gc0208 INSTEAD THEY TRY TO BUILD CASES ON THE TESTIMONY OF CURRENT AND FORMER TENANTS
01gc0209 RATES ARE DETERMINED BY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PURCHASE PRICE AND FACE VALUE
01gc020a THUS HIGHER BIDDING NARROWS THE INVESTOR'S RETURN WHILE LOWER BIDDING WIDENS IT

01gc0210 A BIG PART OF THE REASON FOR WOOD'S SUCCESS IS THE NEW TECHNIQUES DEVELOPED OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS FOR WOOD PANELS WITH A STEEL CORE
01gc0211 BESIDES NARROWING THE PRICE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WOOD AND METAL SYSTEMS THESE TECHNIQUES PROVIDED THE PRECISION NEEDED IN DESIGNING PANEL SYSTEMS THAT MUST FIT TOGETHER
01gc0212 ALMOST ALL THE MAJOR OFFICE FURNITURE MANUFACTURERS HAVE ACQUIRED THE ABILITY TO MAKE WOOD SYSTEMS IN RECENT YEARS
01gc0213 THIS WAS ROUGH ON ALL DEBTORS DOMESTIC AS WELL AS INTERNATIONAL
01gc0214 BUT NO ONE PROPOSED SOLUTIONS FOR DOMESTIC DEBTORS AS GRAND AS THOSE OFFICIALLY OFFERED FOR THIRD WORLD DEBTORS
01gc0215 THE FIRST PART OF THE OFFICIAL PROPOSAL WAS TO REDUCE THE INTEREST BURDEN OF THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES

01T_01TC0218_PED.CH1_SIMU BUT THE INDEX IS BEING REPLACED BY THE EMPLOYMENT COST SERIES
01T_01TC0219_BUS.CH1_SIMU ECONOMISTS SAID THE NEW INDEX HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF BEING A MORE RELIABLE READING AND THE DISADVANTAGE OF COMING OUT ONLY ONCE A QUARTER RATHER THAN EVERY MONTH

029_029C0201_PED.CH1_SIMU THE COMPANY AND MR. TRUMP ARE CURRENTLY BATTLING IN COURT
029_029C0202_CAF.CH1_SIMU AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED MR. TRUMP IS SEEKING TO PREVENT BALLY FROM BUYING GOLDEN NUGGET INCORPORATED'S CASINO HOTEL IN ATLANTIC CITY N. J.
029_029C0203_BUS.CH1_SIMU THE PROPOSED ACQUISITION BY BALLY IS WIDELY PERCEIVED AS AN EFFORT TO SCUTTLE A TAKEOVER ATTEMPT BY MR. TRUMP
029_029C0204_STR.CH1_SIMU ALL INDICATIONS SUGGEST THOUGH THAT THE REAGAN NAKASONE SUMMIT WILL NOT BE ABOUT MONETARY POLICIES
029_029C0205_CAF.CH1_SIMU THEY WILL DISCUSS TRADE ISSUES WHICH ARE CERTAINLY IMPORTANT BUT RATHER REMOTE FROM THE IMMEDIATE PROBLEM
029_029C0206_STR.CH1_SIMU ALL OF THE WORLD'S EXPORTS AND IMPORTS COME TO ABOUT TWO TRILLION DOLLARS A YEAR
029_029C0207_STR.CH1_SIMU BUT FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET TRADING AMOUNTS TO ABOUT ONE TRILLION DOLLARS A WEEK
029_029C0208_BUS.CH1_SIMU IT IS THE FINANCIAL MARKETS THAT THE BATTLE OF THE DOLLAR WILL HAVE TO BE FOUGHT
029_029C0209_CAF.CH1_SIMU INVESTORS RANGING FROM U. S. CORPORATIONS TO JAPANESE BUYERS OF U. S. TREASURY BILLS MUST FACTOR IN A RISK PREMIUM FOR DOLLAR VALIDITY
029_029C020A_STR.CH1_SIMU THUS IT IS AT LEAST PLAUSIBLE IF NOT LIKELY THAT DOLLAR VALIDITY IS ONE REASON REAL INTEREST RATES HAVE STAYED HIGH IN THE U. S.
029_029C020B_BUS.CH1_SIMU IT IS CERTAINLY TRUE THAT NO PLAN TO RESTORE STABILITY TO WORLD MARKETS CAN SUCCEED WITHOUT ADDRESSING DOLLAR VALIDITY
029_029C020C_CAF.CH1_SIMU THERE IS A GROWING MIDDLE CLASS OF COLOMBIANS WHO HAVE WORKED THEIR WAY UP AND ARE NOW BUYING THEIR OWN HOMES AND IMPROVING THEIR STANDARDS OF LIVING
029_029C020D_CAF.CH1_SIMU THEY ARE AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE STABILITY OF THE ECONOMY ABHOR VIOLENCE AND ARE USUALLY PRO U. S.
029_029C020E_PED.CH1_SIMU FURTHER THE HOSPITALITY AND KINDNESS OF THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE ARE SUPERB
029_029C020F_STR.CH1_SIMU I FOUND THIS TO BE TRUE NOT JUST IN THE MAJOR CITIES BUT ALSO IN AREAS THAT THE STATE DEPARTMENT CONSIDERED RISKY
029_029C020G_STR.CH1_SIMU THERE IS NO SHORTAGE OF EXAMPLES
029_029C020H_PED.CH1_SIMU GROWING LIFE EXPECTANCY THREATENS TO BANKRUPT SOCIAL SECURITY BUT THE COMPROMISE OF NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE DID LITTLE MORE THAN BURDEN WORKERS BY RAISING THE PAYROLL TAX
029_029C020I_BUS.CH1_SIMU THE GOVERNMENT CONTINUES TO PILE UP GREAT DEFICITS BUT THE BUDGET SUMMIT COMPROMISE OF LAST AUTUMN HARDLY CUTS ANYTHING AT ALL
029_029C020J_BUS.CH1_SIMU SOVIET INFLUENCE IN NICARAGUA THREATENS U. S. SECURITY BUT THE U. S. HOUSE ENGAGES IN A PITCHED BATTLE OVER EVEN SCRAPS OF MILITARY HARDWARE TO THE CONTRAS
029_029C020K_CAF.CH1_SIMU I THINK THE MARKET JUMPED THE GUN ON THE NOTION OF A WEAK ECONOMY AND THE FED EASING MR. FINE SAID
029_029C020L_CAF.CH1_SIMU SO WHAT WE'RE SEEING NOW IS A CONSOLIDATION
029_029C020M_BUS.CH1_SIMU HE EXPECTS LONG TERM TREASURY BOND YIELDS TO HOVER AROUND THE EIGHT AND ONE HALF PERCENT LEVEL IN THE NEAR FUTURE
029_029C020N_CAF.CH1_SIMU THE STANDOFF CASTS DOUBTS ABOUT HOW SINCERE JAPANESE COMPANIES ARE IN THEIR STATED WILLINGNESS TO BUY MORE U. S. MADE CHIPS
029_029C020O_STR.CH1_SIMU IT ALSO COULD STYMIE A NEW NEGOTIATING APPROACH IN WHICH THE INDUSTRIES NOT THE GOVERNMENTS IRON OUT TRADE DISPUTES
029_029C020P_STR.CH1_SIMU THAT COULD DRIVE AMERICAN CHIP MAKERS TO ASK THE U. S. GOVERNMENT FOR MORE PUNITIVE MEASURES AGAINST JAPAN
029_029C020Q_STR.CH1_SIMU DURING ANY REPAIR PROCESS BLOOD CLOTS ARE CONSTANTLY BEING FORMED AND DISSOLVED
029_029C020R_CAF.CH1_SIMU IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE SCIENTISTS SPECULATE THAT DURING ATTEMPTS TO REPAIR THE ARTERY WALL THE BODY AT SOME POINT TRIES TO DISSOLVE A BLOOD CLOT
029_029C020S_CAF.CH1_SIMU BUT IT MISTAKENLY GRABS PROTEIN INSTEAD OF PLASMINOGEN PULLING IT WITH ITS BAG OF FAT AND CHOLESTEROL INTO THE ARTERY WALL
029_029C020T_PED.CH1_SIMU THIS THWARTS THE REPAIR PROCESS AND BEGINS A VICIOUS CYCLE DRAWING MORE AND MORE CHOLESTEROL INTO THE DAMAGED AREA
029_029C020U_STR.CH1_SIMU AND IN FACT MICROSCOPIC BLOOD CLOTS AND BITS OF LP ARE FOUND IN THE MISHMASH OF THE DEPOSITS
029_029C020V_STR.CH1_SIMU IF THE SETTLEMENT IS COMPLETED THE COMPANY WOULD JOIN SHAREHOLDER PLAINTIFFS IN SEEKING DAMAGES AGAINST FOUNDER EDDIE ANTAR AND OTHERS
029_029C020W_CAF.CH1_SIMU CRAZY EDDIE CURRENTLY IS A DEFENDANT IN THE HOLDERS' LITIGATION
029_029C020X_CAF.CH1_SIMU THE NEW MANAGEMENT HAS ACCUSED MR. ANTAR IN COURT AND REGULATORY FILINGS OF ENGAGING IN A POSSIBLE SCHEME TO FALSIFY INVENTORY AND PROFIT REPORTS
029_029C020Y_PED.CH1_SIMU AND IT DOESN'T APPEAR THAT CABLE OWNERS WILL RESIST THE CHANGE
029_029C020Z_BUS.CH1_SIMU A SPOKESMAN FOR THE NATIONAL CABLE TELEVISION ASSOCIATION SAID WE DON'T OPPOSE THE PROPOSAL IN PRINCIPLE
029_029C0210_CAF.CH1_SIMU WE TAKE THE POSITION THAT THE MORE PEOPLE IN THE CABLE MARKET THE BETTER
029_029C0211_PED.CH1_SIMU THE SALE ANNOUNCEMENT WAS NOT WIDELY EXPECTED
029_029C0212_STR.CH1_SIMU BUT DESPITE THE ELEMENT OF SURPRISE THE NEWS HAD LITTLE NET EFFECT ON THE SECONDARY MARKET FOR NEW YORK BONDS
029_029C0213_PED.CH1_SIMU THERE ISN'T ENOUGH SUPPLY FOR THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE SIZABLE OFFERING TO HAVE MUCH IMPACT EXPLAINED ONE TRADER
029_029C0214_CAF.CH1_SIMU BUT EASTERN EXCLUDED A NUMBER OF HIGH TRAFFIC HUB CITIES FROM THE SPECIAL PROGRAM WHICH INVOLVES TRAVEL FROM SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH TO DECEMBER FIFTEENTH

205c0106 INVESTORS RANGING FROM U. S. CORPORATIONS TO JAPANESE BUYERS OF U. S. T. BILLS MUST FACTOR IN A RISK PREMIUM FOR DOLLAR VOLATILITY
205c0107 THUS IT IS AT LEAST PLAUSIBLE IF NOT LIKELY THAT DOLLAR VOLATILITY IS ONE REASON REAL INTEREST RATES HAVE STAYED HIGH IN THE U. S.
205c0108 IT IS CERTAINLY TRUE THAT NO PLAN TO RESTORE STABILITY TO WORLD MARKETS CAN SUCCEED WITHOUT ADDRESSING DOLLAR VOLATILITY

40ec020g A CONVENTION WOULD OPEN THE DOOR TO A WHOLE NEW GROUP OF LEADERS
40ec020h AN ELECTION TO CHOOSE CONVENTION DELEGATES WOULD BE LIKE A SPECIAL ELECTION TO PICK A NEW CONGRESS
40ec020i UNDER LEGISLATION PASSED BY THE SENATE A CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION WOULD BE MADE UP OF ONE MEMBER ELECTED FROM EACH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT AND TWO AT LARGE FROM EACH STATE
40ec020j NO CURRENT MEMBERS OF CONGRESS COULD PARTICIPATE
40ec020k ALTHOUGH AIRLINES DENY HANDLING COMPLAINTS DIFFERENTLY THEY MAKE NO APOLOGIES ABOUT FAVORING FREQUENT FLIERS IN OTHER WAYS

40ec0214 ALL THE ACTION APPARENTLY WILL BE IN THE COURTROOM
40ec0215 MR. BETHELL HAS AN EYE FOR THE FASHIONABLE AND FOR THE ABOMINABLE WHICH TODAY ARE OFTEN THE SAME THING
40ec0216 HE OBVIOUSLY RELISHES A GOOD FIGHT AND SAYING NO TO THE CULTURAL BARBARIANS AND THE CURRENT WISDOM
40ec0217 HE USES PIG BLADDER HAMMER AND TONGS AND SCALPEL AND HE IS ADEPT WITH THEM ALL AS THE ELECTRIC WINDMILL SHOWS

40F_40FC0218_STR.CH1_SIMU BUT THE INDEX IS BEING REPLACED BY THE EMPLOYMENT COST SERIES
40F_40FC0219_CAF.CH1_SIMU ECONOMISTS SAID THE NEW INDEX HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF BEING A MORE RELIABLE READING AND THE DISADVANTAGE OF COMING OUT ONLY ONCE A QUARTER RATHER THAN EVERY MONTH
