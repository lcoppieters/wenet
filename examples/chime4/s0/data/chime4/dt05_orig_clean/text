22gc0102 MR. WOLF SAID THE NEW JOB WILL BE PRIMARILY BUSINESS ORIENTED
22gc0103 MR. WOLF DECLINED TO NAME HIS NEW EMPLOYER
22gc0104 THE CHIEF TRADER IN NEW YORK FOR A TOKYO BASED BANK AGREES
22gc0105 EVEN IF JAPANESE INVESTORS DON'T SELL DOLLARS SOMEBODY ELSE WILL HE SAYS
22gc0106 THE TREND IS INEVITABLE UNLESS THE GOVERNMENT HAS AUTHORITY OVER THE WHOLE WORLD
22gc0107 CONGRESS AND THE ADMINISTRATION HAVE BEGUN TO TAKE THE RIGHT STEPS TO IMPROVE THE CREDIT BUDGET
22gc0108 A PILOT LOAN SALE PROGRAM APPROVED LAST YEAR WOULD PROVIDE A VIRTUALLY RISK FREE TEST OF THIS APPROACH
22gc0109 INITIAL WALL STREET ENTHUSIASM HAS SURPRISED EVEN PRIVATIZATION ADVOCATES
22gc010a THE FIRST SALES ARE EXPECTED TO GO TO MARKET SOMETIME THIS SUMMER
22gc010b THE OFFERING WILL COMPRISE SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS OF BONDS DUE NOVEMBER SECOND AND SIX HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS OF BONDS MATURING NEXT FEBRUARY FIRST
22gc010c ALL THE BONDS WILL BE DATED NEXT MONDAY
22gc010d INTEREST RATES WILL BE ANNOUNCED WEDNESDAY
22gc010e THE CENTRAL BANKS HAVE LITTLE CHANCE TO PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM THE DOLLAR'S FALL
22gc010f WHEN POSSIBLE THEY TRY TO REDUCE THEIR U. S. CURRENCY PORTFOLIOS BY SELLING DOLLARS BACK INTO CALMER MARKETS
22gc010g TRADERS SAY THE BUNDESBANK DID THIS WHEN THE DOLLAR STRENGTHENED IN LATE JULY AND EARLY AUGUST
22gc010h THE BOSTON PROPERTY WAS FULLY OCCUPIED A BROKER CLOSE TO THE BUILDING SAID
22gc010i IT WAS A DONE DEAL
22gc010j ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY CAME BACK AND SAID WE AREN'T BUYING AT THIS YIELD

22gc010o THERE ARE TWO ISSUES TO CONSIDER
22gc010p FIRST WHAT WAS ADMIRAL POINDEXTER'S BELIEF ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S POLICY OF HELPING THE NICARAGUAN DEMOCRATIC RESISTANCE
22gc010q SECOND DID ADMIRAL POINDEXTER BELIEVE WHAT HE AND COLONEL NORTH WERE DOING WAS LEGAL
22gc010r CERTAIN PRICES HAVE RISEN AT A BRISK PACE THROUGHOUT THIS DECADE
22gc010s HEALTH CARE INFLATION FOR INSTANCE HASN'T DROPPED BELOW SIX PERCENT ANNUALLY AND THE COST OF EDUCATION HAS RISEN EVEN FASTER
22gc010t BUT UNTIL RECENTLY INFLATION IN HEALTH EDUCATION AND OTHER SERVICES WAS OFFSET BY FLAT OR FALLING PRICES FOR MANY MANUFACTURED GOODS AND FARM COMMODITIES
22gc010u THE DECLINE IN THE DOLLAR AND THE CONTINUED STRENGTH IN THE ECONOMY HOWEVER ARE NOW ADDING DEMAND AND CAUSING THOSE PRICES TO RISE TOO
22gc010v THE LOGIC APPARENTLY IS THAT WE'LL HAVE TO RAISE OUR RATES TO DEFEND THE DOLLAR SAID PETER CANELO A PORTFOLIO STRATEGIST AT BEAR STEARNS
22gc010w BUT HE SAID THAT WOULD ONLY BE TRUE IF THE DOLLAR WERE WEAK
22gc010x SINCE THE U. S. CURRENCY HAS STRENGTHENED SHARPLY IN RECENT WEEKS HE SEES NO NEED FOR THE FEDERAL RESERVE TO RAISE INTEREST RATES TO PROTECT THE DOLLAR
22gc010y MANY INSTITUTIONAL PLAYERS CONFESS TO HOLDING MORE CASH THAN USUAL
22gc010z IN THE BULL MARKET OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX TO EIGHTY SEVEN CASH POSITIONS EXCEEDING FIVE PERCENT OF ASSETS WOULD HAVE HELD DOWN OVERALL RETURNS
22gc0110 NOW MANY INSTITUTIONS SAY THEIR CASH LEVELS ARE TEN PERCENT OR MORE AND A FEW ARE AT THIRTY PERCENT OR MORE
22gc0111 YIELDS ON LONG TERM BONDS AFTER DROPPING AS LOW AS SEVEN POINT EIGHT THREE PERCENT EARLY LAST WEEK ARE BACK UP ABOVE EIGHT PERCENT
22gc0112 THE DISCOUNT RATE ON THE THREE MONTH TREASURY BILL FELL AS LOW AS SEVEN POINT SIX FOUR PERCENT BUT WAS QUOTED LATE FRIDAY AT SEVEN POINT EIGHT SIX PERCENT
22gc0113 RATES ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN AT THOSE LEVELS OR MOVE A LITTLE HIGHER THIS WEEK AT THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT'S QUARTERLY AUCTION
